<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of experimental evidence have suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> may exacerbate ischemic central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains to be clarified whether a single hyperglycemic event or persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is predictive of poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-seven patients undergoing treatment for aneurysmal SAH were observed, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> perioperative variables were entered into a database of prospectively recorded data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were retrospectively added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined at hospital discharge (14-21 days after SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>), and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were prospectively documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GOS score at last follow-up was retrospectively determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> greater than 200 mg/dl for 2 or more consecutive days was defined as persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome was categorized as "poor" (dependent function [GOS Score 1-3]) or "good" (independent function [GOS Score 4 or 5]) at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The independent association of 2-week and final follow-up outcome (GOS score) with the daily serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels was assessed using a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, increasing age, increasing Hunt and Hess grade, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> on admission computed tomography scan, Caucasian race, and higher mean daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were associated with poor (dependent) 2-week outcome after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, older age, the occurrence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, increasing admission Hunt and Hess grade, and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were independent predictors of poor (dependent) outcome 2 weeks after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Admission Hunt and Hess grade and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were independent predictors of poor outcome at last follow-up examination a mean 10 +/- 3 months after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Isolated hyperglycemic events did not predict poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were 10-fold more likely to have a poor (dependent) 2-week outcome and sevenfold more likely to have a poor outcome a mean 10 months after aneurysmal SAH independent of admission Hunt and Hess grade, occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were seven times more likely to have a poor outcome at a mean of 10 months after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Isolated hyperglycemic events were not predictive of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting of aneurysmal SAH may help predict outcomes months after surgery </plain></SENT>
