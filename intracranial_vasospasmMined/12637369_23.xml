<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although there is evidence that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway and protein kinase C (PKC) are involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the mechanism by which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) activates these pathways is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large body of evidence points to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (OxyHb) as a major causative component of blood clot responsible for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present studies were conducted to explore whether the Rho/Rho kinase and PKC may be involved in a sustained vasoconstriction induced by OxyHb in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OxyHb evoked sustained vasoconstriction in the endothelium-denuded rabbit basilar arteries, which was reversed by the selective inhibitors of Rho kinase, Y-27632, and HA-1077, with the IC50 values of 0.26+/-0.02 and 0.74+/-0.1 micromol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In quiescent cerebrovascular smooth muscle (CVSM) cells, OxyHb induced Rho translocation, as assessed by immunoblotting, with a time course, which paralleled the contractile action of OxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rho translocation was also observed in intact arteries stimulated with OxyHb for 24 hours (219%) and 48 hours (160%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in Rho translocation was fully inhibited by GGTI-297, an inhibitor of Rho prenylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OxyHb also caused significant translocation of both PKCalpha and PKCepsilon (P&lt;0.01), which was maximal at the time corresponding to maximal tension developed in response to OxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ro-32-0432, an inhibitor of PKC, attenuated vasoconstriction mediated by OxyHb in basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show, for the first time, that OxyHb-mediated signaling in CVSM utilizes the Rho/Rho kinase and PKC-based mechanisms </plain></SENT>
