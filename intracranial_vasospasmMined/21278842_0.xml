<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Every patient evaluated and treated in the SNB is enrolled in a clinical research protocol, which underscores a singular focus on advancing neurosurgical research and patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the inception of the SNB, this research effort has been driven by dedicated clinician-investigators and basic scientists including Maitland Baldwin, Igor Klatzo, John M </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These and other SNB investigators have studied and advanced treatment of a number of neuropathologic processes, including delineation of differences between cytotoxic and vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, head injury, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221406" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing disease</z:e>, the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor in <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system tissues, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor syndromes, the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>, mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002390'>spinal arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, mechanisms of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and drug delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently, SNB efforts are focused on central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system drug delivery, the natural history of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> syndromes, functional neurosurgery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, vasospasm, and development of chemotherapeutics for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Throughout its history, the SNB has also been dedicated to training neurosurgeon clinician-investigators; 23 previous fellows/staff have become chairs of their respective neurosurgical departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recently, the commitment to training future neurosurgeon clinician-investigators has been further defined with the development of a residency-training program in neurological surgery approved in 2010 </plain></SENT>
