<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients with vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> had 63 PCT images obtained during the course of vasospasm </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average minimal regional CBF (rCBF) and maximal regional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in patients with delayed ischemic deficit were significantly different in comparison with patients without delayed ischemic deficit (22.6 +/- 11.2 cm3/100 g/min versus 45.2 +/- 21.3 cm3/100 g/min, P &lt; 0.001; 7.3 +/- 2.5 s versus 3.3 +/- 1.7 s, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
