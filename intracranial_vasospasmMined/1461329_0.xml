<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven dogs (French Grande Venerie) weighing between 40 to 50 kg, were randomly assigned in three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under general anesthesia, each animal underwent baseline angiography, followed by right frontotemporal craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retractor was placed under the temporal lobe and the arachnoid membrane over the internal carotid artery was dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>10 ml of autologous arterial blood was placed around the internal carotid artery, and 5 ml of arterial blood was injected into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
