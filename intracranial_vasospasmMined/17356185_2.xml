<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Hypertensive, hypervolemic, and hemodilutional (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHH</z:e>) therapy for vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> requires high doses of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, leading to adverse adrenergic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to stabilize advanced shock states while facilitating reduction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> doses, but its use has never been reported in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, we investigated the hemodynamic effects and feasibility of supplementary AVP in refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHH</z:e> therapy in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hemodynamic response (mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate, central venous pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, and end diastolic volume index) to a supplementary AVP infusion (0.01-0.04 IU/minute) was recorded within the first 24 hours in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints (serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration, incidence of vasospasm, and intracranial pressure [ICP]) were compared to controls on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHH</z:e> therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After initiation of AVP, MAP increased significantly compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi> doses decreased significantly, whereas other hemodynamic parameters remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentrations decreased similarly in both groups (-5 +/- 7 mmol/L versus -6 +/- 4 mmol/L; p = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No detrimental effects on vasospasm incidence or ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AVP may be considered as an alternative supplementary vasopressor in refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHH</z:e> therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although we did not observe any deleterious effect of AVP on cerebral circulation, close observation for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> should be undertaken, until it is clearly demonstrated that AVP has no adverse effects on regional cerebral blood flow and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our limited data suggest that low-dose AVP does not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, but further study is merited </plain></SENT>
