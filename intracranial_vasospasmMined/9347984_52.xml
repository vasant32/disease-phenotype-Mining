<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to determine whether intracarotid infusions of newly developed NO-donating compounds (NONOates) could reverse vasospasm or prevent the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a primate model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cynomolgus monkeys were studied in two experimental settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infusion experiment, saline or NONOate was infused intracarotidly in four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monkeys and in four monkeys after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the infusions regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in eight animals and CBF velocity in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infusion experiment, saline (four animals) or NONOate (diethylamine-NO [three animals] or proli-NO [six animals]) was infused intracarotidly in monkeys for 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infusion experiments, 3-minute intracarotid diethylamine-NO infusions reversed arteriographically confirmed vasospasm of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) (as viewed on anteroposterior projection, the decrease in area was 8.4+/-4.3% in the treatment group compared with 35+/-12% in the control group; p &lt; 0.004), increased rCBF by 31+/-1.9% (p &lt; 0.002), and decreased the mean systolic CBF velocity in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a long-term infusion experiment, the area of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in control animals decreased by 63+/-5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In animals undergoing a 7-day continuous glucantime-NO intracarotid infusion, the area of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> decreased by 15+/-6.2%, and in animals undergoing a 7-day proli-NO infusion, the area of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> decreased by 11+/-2.9% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial blood pressure decreased in the glucantime-NO group from 75+/-12 mm Hg (during saline infusion) to 57+/-10 mm Hg (during glucantime-NO infusion; p &lt; 0.05), but it was unchanged in animals undergoing proli-NO infusion (76+/-12 mm Hg vs. 78+/-12 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results of these experiments show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is both reversed and completely prevented by NO replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, only the use of regional infusion of the NONOate with an extremely short half-life avoided a concomitant decrease in arterial blood pressure, which could produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in patients with impaired autoregulation of CBF after the rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
