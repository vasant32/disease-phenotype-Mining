<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that accelerating factors of collagen synthesis in the muscle layer may be released from the adventitial side, and collagen synthesis is induced by extravascular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes of collagen volume with time suggest collagen to be an important phenomenon of persistent vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histoimmunological studies showed that increased collagen fibers in the tunica media were mainly type III collagen, implying that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may be related to chemical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
