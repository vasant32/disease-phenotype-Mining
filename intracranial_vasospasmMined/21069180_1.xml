<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The focus of this study is to explore differences in protein phosphorylation in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) among healthy patients, SAH patients and SAH-CV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in phosphorylation among the three sample types could be an important step towards the discovery of a diagnostic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identification and validation of phosphorylated protein differences for study is manifested in the nature of signaling involved in the pathological events seen post SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Capillary liquid chromatography (cap-LC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and nano-liquid chromatography-CHIP/ion trap mass spectrometry (nanoLC-CHIP/ITMS) are used to identify and measure protein phosphorylation changes in the CSF of the aforementioned groups </plain></SENT>
