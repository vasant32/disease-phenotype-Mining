<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effect of diltiazem on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, intracranial pressure and systemic blood pressure were investigated using dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was induced by an injection of 5 ml of autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diltiazem (10(-6) M) was administrated into the cisterna magna and the dilating effect of the drug on the basilar artery was monitored angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intrathecal administration of diltiazem relieved the vasospasm for more than 30 minutes, same as that of the intra-arterial administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the intracranial and blood pressures remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes of concentration of the drug in CSF and plasma following the intracisternal administration of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-diltiazem were measured using rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentration of an administered diltiazem in CSF and plasma was quickly decreased and reduced to 2% of its initial value after one hour (t1/2 = 8 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that even the concentration of diltiazem is very low in CSF, the vasodilating effect continues for more than 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the intrathecal administration of diltiazem may be useful for the prevention and treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
