<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The modes of action of these compounds were compared with those of the more commonly used calcium entry blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">Calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 (4.8 X 10(-6) M)-induced contraction of a canine basilar artery strip was completely antagonized by the HA compounds (10(-5) M) but not by the entry-blocking calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> nicardipine, diltiazem, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (10(-5) M), suggesting that the HA compounds act differently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was induced by a "two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>" canine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the vasospasm and the effects of the HA compounds were determined angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On SAH Day 7, a significant vasospasm was observed in every dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery had diminished to 59% +/- 2% (mean +/- standard error) of the control value obtained before SAH (on Day 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intravenous administration of HA 1004 caused a mild dilation of the basilar artery of 10% and 11% at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively; however, HA 1077 produced a more marked dilation of 19% and 27%, respectively, at the same doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both of these drugs lowered mean arterial blood pressure to about 80% and 50% at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal administration of the HA compounds (6 mg) completely reversed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> without much effect on the blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intracellular calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of the HA compound group appear to be promising agents for the treatment of intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
