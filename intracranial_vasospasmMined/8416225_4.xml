<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in the <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> spectrum, as demonstrated by in vivo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">phosphorus-31</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>) magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) spectroscopy, or in regional CBF were measured in the parietal cortex during graded <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential changes in the <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> spectrum were observed during moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in the animals 7 days after the introduction of an autologous blood clot around the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiograms revealed a reduction in vessel caliber by approximately 50% in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean CBF in the spasm side decreased in parallel with a decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) from 120 to 40 mm Hg, indicating the abolition of autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the mean percentage totals of inorganic phosphate (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>), phosphocreatine (PCr), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP), and pH between the hemispheres at baseline MABP before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The values of PCr, ATP, and pH decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) at an MABP of less than 60 mm Hg in the involved hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of PCr:<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> decreased in parallel with a decrease in MABP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ATP showed a stepwise decrease during moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (MABP 60 mm Hg) and was reduced significantly 20 minutes after the beginning of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that, during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm, changes in cerebral energy metabolism are coupled with changes in CBF in the state of impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
