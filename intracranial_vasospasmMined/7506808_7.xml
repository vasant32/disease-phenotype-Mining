<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> increased endothelin-1 secretion into the medium in a dose-dependent manner after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The enhanced secretion of endothelin-1 in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was sustained for 72 hours, suggesting active production and secretion of endothelin-1 rather than release from intracellular pools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secreted endothelin-1 in the medium was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
