<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is the purpose of this paper to report ultrastructural features of myonecrosis following adrenalin-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter was induced in 10 dogs by a single subarachnoid injection of 0.2 mg/kg of adrenalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two dogs died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> 3 and 6 days respectively after the experiment, whereas eight other dogs were killed between 2 and 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, the circle of Willis showed coagulation <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fine structure of myonecrosis was characterized by six dynamic changes of vacuolation, dissolution of myofilaments, focal cytoplasmic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, fragmentation, coagulation <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and intercellular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite a simple experimental procedure, the present models disclosed myonecrosis with a marked similarity to humans and contained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the previously reported ultrastructural features of experimental myonecrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that sustained contraction of smooth-muscle cells beyond their metabolic capability results in the mechanical destruction of myofilaments </plain></SENT>
