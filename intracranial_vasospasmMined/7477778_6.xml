<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most promising effects have been obtained when physicians suspect that a major vasospastic component underlies the ischemic symptoms (e.g., as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034734" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the clinical success of this treatment method, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the pain relief it produces and its anti-ischemic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most earlier experimental studies have used <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals or animals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by injection of autologal blood into the cerebrospinal fluid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we applied SCS in a rat model via implanted electrodes to study the effect of preemptive stimulation on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> caused by vasospasm in a neurovascular flap in the groin; the vasospasm was induced by mechanical pressure applied to the feeding artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rats treated with SCS, delivered with parameters similar to those used clinically, the percentage of flaps recovering <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> microcirculation after the spasm was significantly higher than in the untreated control group (100 and 28%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05), and the maximal blood flow after the ischemic episode was significantly higher in the SCS group than in the control group (127 and 51 arbitrary units, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of animals regaining the premanipulation circulation after the provocation of a second spasm was also greater in the SCS-treated group than in the control animals (50 and 14%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pilot studies showed that this protective effect was specific to SCS given before spasm induction, an observation corroborated by clinical experiences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
