<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, the pulsed-dye laser was applied intravascularly via a 320-microns fiber to basilar artery segments from six dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The segments were mounted in a vessel-perfusion apparatus and constricted to, on average, 70% of resting diameter by superfusion with dog hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediate increase in basilar artery diameter occurred to a mean of 83% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second model, the basilar artery was exposed transclivally in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, superfusion of the artery with rabbit hemolysate resulted in a reduction of mean vessel diameter to 81% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following extravascular application of the laser, vessels returned to an average of 106% of the resting state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six rabbits, the basilar artery was constricted by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 days apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two to 4 days after the second injection, the basilar artery was exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extravascular laser treatment from a <z:chebi fb="115" ids="46727">quartz</z:chebi> fiber placed perpendicular to the vessel adventitia resulted in an immediate 53% average increase in caliber to an estimated 107% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No reconstriction was observed over a period of up to 5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, damage to the arterial wall was slight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This preliminary investigation suggests that the 1-microsecond pulsed-dye laser may be of benefit in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
