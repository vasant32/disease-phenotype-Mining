<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood flow velocities (BFVs) were recorded with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, before surgery and every other day after surgery, for a group of 50 patients who underwent transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomies for treatment of hippocampal <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BFVs in basal arteries ipsilateral to the surgical approach increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001) from preoperative baseline values of approximately 52 +/- 13 cm/s (mean +/- standard deviation) to values of approximately 86 +/- 27 cm/s on postoperative Day 3 and reached their maximal values of approximately 115 +/- 37 cm/s after a median of 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BFVs in contralateral vessels exhibited a similar but somewhat attenuated pattern </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular reactivity was impaired in 83.3% of the cases ipsilaterally and in 33.3% contralaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients who undergo microneurosurgical procedures develop bilateral alterations of their cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because these changes remain asymptomatic for the majority of patients, the transsylvian approach can be considered "minimally invasive" but not "atraumatic." Alternative surgical routes and alternative treatment modalities should be investigated in a similar manner </plain></SENT>
