<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Matricellular protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) is a class of nonstructural and secreted extracellular matrix proteins that exert diverse functions, but its role in vascular smooth muscle contraction has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: First, rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) models were produced by endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and examined for tenascin-C (TNC) and osteopontin (OPN) induction (representatives of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCPs</z:chebi>) in vasospastic cerebral arteries using immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second, recombinant TNC (r-TNC), recombinant OPN (r-OPN), or both were injected into a cisterna magna in healthy rats, and the effects on the diameter of basilar arteries were determined using India ink angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In SAH rats, TNC immunoreactivity was markedly induced in the smooth muscle cell layers of spastic cerebral arteries on day 1 but not in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TNC immunoreactivity decreased on day 3 as vasospasm improved: OPN immunoreactivity, on the other hand, was more induced in the arterial wall on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>r-TNC injections caused prolonged contractions of rat basilar arteries, which were reversed by r-OPN, although r-OPN itself had no effect on the vessel diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCPs</z:chebi>, including TNC and OPN, may contribute to the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and provide a novel therapeutic approach against it </plain></SENT>
