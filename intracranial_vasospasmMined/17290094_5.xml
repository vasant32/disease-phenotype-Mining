<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytokine-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> has been implicated as a causative factor in the development of posthemorrhagic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous experiments using the rat femoral artery model of vasospasm, we demonstrated that elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 are present after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and that a polyclonal antibody against IL-6 is capable of attenuating experimental vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, we tested the ability of a novel selective proinflammatory cytokine inhibitor (CNI-1493) to protect against the occurrence of experimental vasospasm in the same rat femoral artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CNI-1493 was administered by injection directly into the blood-filled femoral pouches of animals at the time of their initial surgery (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed at 8 days posthemorrhage and degree of vasospasm was assessed by image analysis of artery cross-sectional area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a separate series of experiments, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and the prototypical antiinflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 after treatment with CNI-1493 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with CNI-1493 provided dose-dependent attenuation of posthemorrhagic vasospasm, with the highest dose (200 microg in 8 microL dH2O) causing complete reversal of vasospasm (vessel cross-sectional area ratio 1.06 +/- 0.04 versus 0.87 +/- 0.06, p &lt; 0.05, one-way analysis of variance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assessment of cytokine levels by ELISA confirmed the selectivity of CNI-1493 by demonstrating significant reductions in IL-6 levels, but no suppression of TGF-beta1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the conclusion that inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6, play an important role in development of vasospasm in the rat femoral artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these results suggest that the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines may be an appropriate strategy for the treatment of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
