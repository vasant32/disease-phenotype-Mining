<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi>, because it inhibits Type IV cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase enzyme in both cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, is a powerful inotrope and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, but it has little effect on heart rate or blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of these properties, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> is an attractive potential therapy after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> canine model of vasospasm was used to study the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm and systemic hemodynamics were compared in a treatment group of animals that received a loading dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> (0.05 mg/kg, intravenously) and then slow-release (0.05 microgram/kg/min) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> pellets (n = 10) and a control group that received placebo pellets (n = 9), over an 8-day period after the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was created by injection of 4 ml of autologous, nonheparinized, arterial blood into the cisterna magna on Days 1 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic measurements, including cardiac output determinations, were made on Days 0, 1, 3, 6, and 8 with a pulmonary artery catheter, and angiographic vasospasm was assessed on Day 8 by comparison with baseline angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> caused no significant changes in systemic hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm, however, was significantly reduced in the Day 8 angiograms for the treated group, compared with the control group (98.28 +/- 14.06 and 67.89 +/- 13.06% of original vessel cross-sectional area, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> is effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a canine model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect is independent of changes in systemic hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> and related drugs warrant further investigation for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
