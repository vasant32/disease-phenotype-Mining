<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this series of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> from aneurysmal rupture, gathered from several neurosurgical services, certain morphological features were studied in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with very large <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> tended to have poor neurological grades on admission to hospital and their immediate discharge outlook was correspondingly poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ruptured middle cerebral and pericallosal artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were relatively common causes of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with temporal lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> did relatively well; those with parietal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> did poorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The larger the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> the less chance there was of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> but the more likely was pre-operative brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival was more closely linked to size and location of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> than to the location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or the degree of midline shift </plain></SENT>
