<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resolution of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was documented photographically and microscopically at intervals from 1 hr to 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photographs indicated that most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was resorbed within 3 days, an observation confirmed microscopically by the amount of red blood cells in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was documented within the first 2 days after the induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with the basilar artery returning to baseline values at an average of 3 days followed by moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> at 5 to 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The suitability of the rat as an animal model for further investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
