<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Results of prior studies in rats and rabbits show that the alteration of vasomotor tone in vasospasm following periadventitial blood exposure may be reversed, at least in part, by the administration of compounds releasing nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors have now generalized this finding to nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten cynomolgus monkeys underwent cerebral angiography before and 7 days following the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) by the placement of 2 to 3 ml clotted autologous blood around the supraclinoid carotid, proximal anterior cerebral, and proximal middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="46916">vinyl acetate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>, either blank (five animals) or containing 20% w/w (Z)-1-[2-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22502">2-aminoethyl</z:chebi>)-N-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22502">2-aminoethyl</z:chebi>)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA/NO, 4.3 mg/kg; five animals) was placed adjacent to the vessels at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed on Day 7 post-SAH following repeated cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of control vascular areal fraction was calculated from angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vessels were sectioned and the mean percentage of lumen patency was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One animal that had received the DETA/NO polymer died prior to repeated angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining animals, DETA/NO caused a significant decrease in vasospasm compared with controls, according to both angiographic (84.8 +/- 8.6 compared with 56.6 +/- 5.2%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) and histological studies (internal carotid artery 99.3 +/- 1.8 compared with 60.1 +/- 4.4%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001; middle cerebral artery 98.4 +/- 3 compared with 56.1 +/- 3.7%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001; and anterior cerebral artery 89.2 +/- 8.5 compared with 55.8 +/- 6.3%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The controlled release of DETA/NO is effective in preventing delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in an SAH model in nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of one animal in the treatment group indicates that the present dosage is at the threshold between therapeutic efficacy and toxicity </plain></SENT>
