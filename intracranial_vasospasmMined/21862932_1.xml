<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association between TNC levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and symptomatic vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), and the prognostic value of TNC levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TNC levels were measured in CSF in 33 consecutive patients diagnosed with aneurysmal SAH of Fisher computed tomography group III and were compared between those with and without subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing symptomatic vasospasm were determined using multivariate logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The receiver-operating characteristic curve technique was used to assess specificity and sensitivity in the prediction of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CSF TNC levels peaked immediately after SAH and were significantly higher in patients who subsequently developed symptomatic vasospasm than in those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analyses, higher TNC levels in the CSF (odds ratio, 1.059; 95% confidence interval, 1.023-1.096; P&lt;0.001) and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades IV to V on admission (odds ratio, 3.238; 95% confidence interval, 1.033-10.152; P&lt;0.05) significantly predicted symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To predict the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic vasospasm, 16.2 ng/mL was considered as an appropriate cut-off value for CSF TNC on days 1 through 6, giving a sensitivity of 81.0% and a specificity of 79.5% (negative and positive predictive values: 82.3% and 76.7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TNC in the CSF may be a useful biomarker for predicting subsequent development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
