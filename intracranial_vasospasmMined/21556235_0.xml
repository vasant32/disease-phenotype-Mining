<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA) for SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with an angiographically confirmed significant vasospasm (&gt;50% vessel narrowing and clinical deterioration) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 54 vessel segments with significant vasospasm were treated by TBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography was used to confirm the presence of vasospasm, and TBA was performed to dilate vasospastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medical and angiographic reports were reviewed to determine technical efficacy and for procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TBA using Hyper-Glide or Hyper-Form balloons (MicroTherapeutics, Irvine, CA) was successfully accomplished in 88.9% vasospastic segments (48 of 54), namely, in the distal internal carotid artery (100%, n=7), the middle cerebral artery (100%), including the M1 (n=10), M2 (n=10), and M3 segments (n=4), in the vertebral artery (100%, n=2), basilar artery (100%, n=1), and in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), including the A1 (66%), A2 (66%), and A3 segments (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameters significantly increased after TBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of vessel rupture or thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GCS at one day after TBA showed an improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that TBA using Hyper-Glide or Hyper-Form balloons is a safe and effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
