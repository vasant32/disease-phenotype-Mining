<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a synthetic serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>, gabexate mesilate (GM), a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3078">betamethasone sodium phosphate</z:chebi> (B-P), and an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, CYA), to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These agents were administered intra-venously every 12 hours for three injections, starting 20 minutes after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the group treated with GM, B-P, or CYA, there were no statistically significant differences in arterial calibers between treated and untreated controls on day 2 </plain></SENT>
