<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of endothelium-related factors in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) has gained interest since the discovery of endothelin-1 (ET-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined, before and after SAH, the responsiveness of the cerebrovascular bed of the goat to ET-1, the sources of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> in ET-1-induced responses, and the ability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> entry blocker nicardipine to counteract them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before SAH, injection of ET-1 into the cerebral circulation increased cerebrovascular resistance, thereby producing dose-dependent reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF), which were prevented by nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In isolated middle cerebral arteries, ET-1 induced concentration-dependent contractions, which were equally inhibited in Ca(2+)-free medium (without or with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30742">ethylene glycol</z:chebi> tetraacetic acid) and by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> entry blocker nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the third day after SAH, CBF was reduced by 28% and cerebrovascular resistance increased by 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, both ET-1-induced reductions in CBF and the constricting effects of ET-1 in vitro were enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability of nicardipine to increase CBF and to inhibit the effects of ET-1 was impaired as a result of reduced dependence of cerebral arteries on extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the seventh day after SAH, CBF and cerebrovascular resistance returned to control values, and effects of ET-1 became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the hyperreactivity to ET-1 of the cerebrovascular bed induced by SAH could have a role in the development of vasospasm, which could reduce the vascular effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> entry blockers after SAH </plain></SENT>
