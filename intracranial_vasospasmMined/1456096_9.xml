<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeated angiographic examinations of the vertebro-basilar and right internal carotid arteries revealed a biphasic vasospasm with a maximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spasm at ten minutes and maximal late spasm at six days after blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study has shown that a reproducible biphasic vasospasm can be produced in the squirrel monkey and evaluated by repeated angiographic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model is suitable in the study of basic mechanisms underlying vasospasm in a primate and, due to the size of the animal, autoradiographic evaluation of the cerebral blood flow and metabolism can be performed at an acceptable cost </plain></SENT>
