<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The potent vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, endothelin-1 (ET-1), has been implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that occurs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is synthesized as a large prepropeptide that requires a series of modifying steps for its activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The last of these steps involves the proteolytic conversion of a relatively inactive propeptide, Big ET-1, to its active, 21-amino acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The enzyme responsible for converting Big ET-1 to ET-1 is a metalloprotease called endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study the authors examined the effects of a newly developed inhibitor of ECE on responses to ET <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar artery and on pathophysiological constriction in the spastic basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first series of experiments the authors examined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar arteries in the rabbit, which were exposed transclivally and measured on-line using videomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration or topical application of an active inhibitor of ECE, CGS 26303, blocked vasoconstrictor responses to topically applied Big ET-1 but not to ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, topical application of a structurally related compound that does not inhibit ECE, CGS 24592, was ineffective in blocking vasoconstriction that was elicited by a topical application of Big ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that CGS 26303 when administered systemically is capable of blocking the conversion of Big ET-1 to ET-1 in the basilar artery without affecting the ability of the vessel to respond to ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second series of experiments the authors examined the effects of the ECE inhibitor on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal administration of CGS 26303 via osmotic minipumps significantly attenuated the delayed spastic response of the basilar artery to an intracisternal injection of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first evidence that systemic administration of an inhibitor of ECE is capable of preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results reinforce a growing body of evidence that ETs play a critical role in the development of spastic constriction after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the findings indicate that blocking the conversion of Big ET-1 to its active ET-1 form using CGS 26303 may represent a feasible strategy for ameliorating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
