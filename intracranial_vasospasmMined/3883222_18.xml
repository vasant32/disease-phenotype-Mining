<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There seemed to be a correlation between the severity of vasospasm and the magnitude of pathological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myofibroblasts and Type V collagen within the medial layer were abundant in vessels showing marked constriction, but were less conspicuous in those arteries showing milder involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arteries from patients who died from noncerebral causes did not demonstrate these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, myofibroblasts and Type V collagen may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by holding the damaged vessel in a contracted phase for weeks during the healing period </plain></SENT>
