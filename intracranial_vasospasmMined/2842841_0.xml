<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 50 patients the influence of the amount of subarachnoid blood detected by CT and the amount of the nonionic contrast medium on the postoperative vasospasm and the outcome of the patient were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For angiographically proven vasospasm, a grading system is suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the extent of the haemorrhage and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If used within limits, the volume of the contrast medium does not seem to exercise any influence on the development of vasospasm and on the results after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a complete investigation of the cerebral vascular system should be performed before surgical management of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> is initiated </plain></SENT>
