<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Enhanced cisternal drainage was performed following early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery in patients with Hunt and Kosnik grades I-III, to effect continuous wash-out of subarachnoid blood clots and reduce symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following extensive evacuation of the cisternal blood clots, the Liliequist's membrane was opened extensively and a third ventriculostomy was effected by opening the lamina terminals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drainage effect was considered as poor, moderate or fair, depending on the average amount of CSF drainage/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH was graded into 0-III depending on the severity of cisternal haematoma in the pre-operative CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No symptomatic vasospasm occurred in patients with SAH grade I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SAH grade II + III patients symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 78, 60 and 42% of patients with a poor, moderate and fair drainage effect, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients who developed symptomatic vasospasm were treated by hypertensive/hypervolemic therapy (HHT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HHT was effective in 7 patients with fair and moderate CSF drainage and ineffective in 2 patients with poor a drainage effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems, that enhanced post-operative cisternal drainage can reduce the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm and be of benefit to the outcome of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
