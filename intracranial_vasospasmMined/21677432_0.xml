<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (VS) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reversal of VS by intra-arterial infusion of cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP)-elevating agents has been reported; however, the preventive role in the development of VS is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is designed to evaluate the possible efficacy of using cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 3 and a cAMP-elevating agent, in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective randomized study, we enrolled 100 SAH patients who met the following criteria: neck clipping within 72 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, Hunt and Hess (HH) score ≤4, modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ≤2 prior to ictus, and no serious cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into control and cilostazol groups; we focused on the effects of cilostazol on the decrease in the incidence of symptomatic VS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and the mRS score at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Patients' age, male/female ratio, mRS score prior to ictus, HH grade, Fisher group, site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, drugs prescribed during the observation period, and length of hospital stay were not different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol did not significantly decrease the incidence of symptomatic VS (37.3% in the control vs. 22.4% in the cilostazol group, p = 0.183) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (27.5% in control vs. 10.2% in the cilostazol, p = 0.091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, mRS score was significantly improved at discharge (2.6 in controls vs. 1.5 in the cilostazol group, p = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients' age being ≤65 years (OR = 8.47, 95% CI = 2.45-29.32, p = 0.0007), Fisher group ≤3 (OR = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.00-21.45, p = 0.049), HH grade ≤2 (OR = 4.31, 95% CI = 1.27-14.59, p = 0.019), no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (OR = 8.55, 95% CI = 1.72-19.23, p = 0.0046), and cilostazol use (OR = 5.52, 95% CI = 1.61-18.90, p = 0.0065) were independent predictors of good outcomes (mRS score ≤2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cilostazol may improve outcomes after SAH, but further double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are required for a definitive conclusion </plain></SENT>
