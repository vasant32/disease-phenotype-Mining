<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Articles reported from 1966 to 2001 and identified through a MEDLINE search of the English language literature on the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> in traumatic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) secondary to TBI is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies suggest that it may be useful in the management of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, when used in combination with standard techniques, by decreasing cerebral blood flow and reducing ICP during the restoration of the blood brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its unique mechanism of action may be due to precapillary vasoconstriction, which reduces the transcapillary transfer of fluid into the cerebral extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, large, prospective, randomised and controlled studies have not yet been performed to confirm its benefit in patients with TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> should only be considered as an experimental therapy for refractory intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in TBI patients, as current evidence is not available to support its routine use in the management of an elevated ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its use in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> disorders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PUD|pud|GDU">peptic ulceration</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> is contraindicated </plain></SENT>
