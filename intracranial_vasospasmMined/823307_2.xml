<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten monkeys (62%) developed spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of seven monkeys treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> (a beta2-adrenergic stimulating drug), five had relief of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four monkeys, one of which had failed to respond to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> alone, were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> and aminophylline (a phosphodiesterase-inhibiting drug), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four were relieved of their vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When considered as one group, the monkeys had an 81% response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that a combination of beta2-adrenergic stimulation and phosphodiesterase-inhibition might be of value in preventing or treating delayed cerebral arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
