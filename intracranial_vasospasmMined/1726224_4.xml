<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This portable DSA unit was used in 161 cases (130 in the operating room and 31 in the intensive care unit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the operating room it is useful: 1) to confirm patency of the parent artery and its branches after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, 2) to identify feeding arteries of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> and to confirm total extirpation, 3) to confirm the patency of extracranial-intracranial bypass, 4) to confirm patency of the internal carotid artery and absence of flap formation after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the intensive care unit, it is particularly useful for visualizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and recanalization of an occluded major intracranial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absence of intracranial circulation can be demonstrated in patients with suspected brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
