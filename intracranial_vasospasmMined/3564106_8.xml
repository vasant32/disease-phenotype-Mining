<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> was caused by puncture of the internal carotid artery just proximal to the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Segments taken close to the origins of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries consistently showed decreased distensibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, they exhibited large, prolonged, spontaneous increases in muscle tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other alterations observed include a marked reduction in the capacity of the vessel wall to contract, reduction in constrictor and dilator nerve influences on vascular tone, and some increased sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small pial arteries (150-200 micron o.d.) from the side of the injury showed large spontaneous irregular increases in tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that 5-6 days after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in monkeys the change most responsible for persistent narrowing in the larger arteries is an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is probably caused by an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the smaller arteries, abnormal spontaneous contractile activity is a major factor in narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This activity is not stretch-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the initial cause of the arterial narrowing after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is the action of vasoactive substances released in the close vicinity of the arterial wall, which lead to tissue damage, abnormal tone, and an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
