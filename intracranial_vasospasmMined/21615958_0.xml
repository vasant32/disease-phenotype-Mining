<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and -2 (Ang-2) are keyplayers in the regulation of endothelial homeostasis and vascular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiopoietins may play an important role in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ang-1 and Ang-2 have not been investigated in this regard so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and 20 healthy controls (HC) were included in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from days 1 to 7 and every other day thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ang-1 and Ang-2 were measured in serum samples using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography was performed to monitor the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAH patients showed a significant drop of Ang-1 levels on day 2 and 3 post SAH compared to baseline and HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients, who developed Doppler sonographic CVS, showed significantly lower levels of Ang-1 with a sustained decrease in contrast to patients without Doppler sonographic CVS, whose Ang-1 levels recovered in the later course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> attributable to vasospasm significantly lower Ang-1 levels have already been observed on the day of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences of Ang-2 between SAH patients and HC or patients with and without Doppler sonographic CVS were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ang-1, but not Ang-2, is significantly altered in patients suffering from SAH and especially in those experiencing CVS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The loss of vascular integrity, regulated by Ang-1, might be in part responsible for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
