<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied whether endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) is upregulated and uncoupled in large cerebral arteries after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and also whether this causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a mouse model of anterior circulation SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Control animals underwent injection of saline instead of blood (n=16 SAH and n=16 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was significant vasospasm of the middle cerebral artery 2 days after SAH (lumen radius/wall thickness ratio 4.3 ± 1.3 for SAH, 23.2 ± 2.1 for saline, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was associated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling, cleaved caspase-3, and Fluoro-Jade-positive neurons in the cortex and with CA1 and dentate regions in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were multiple fibrinogen-positive microthromboemboli in the cortex and hippocampus after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice expressing lacZ under control of the eNOS promoter had increased X-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> staining in large arteries after SAH, and this was confirmed by the increased eNOS protein on western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence that eNOS was uncoupled was found in that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> availability was decreased, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> concentrations were increased in the brains of mice with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that artery constriction by SAH upregulates eNOS but that it is uncoupled and produces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> that may generate microemboli that travel distally and contribute to brain injury </plain></SENT>
