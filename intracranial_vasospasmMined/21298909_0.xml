<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty years after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was first described, this problem remains unsolved in spite of its highly adverse effect on prognosis after aneurysmatic rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment is somewhat empirical, given that uncertainties remain in our understanding of the pathophysiology of this vascular complication, which involves structural and biochemical changes in the endothelium and smooth muscle of vessels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prophylaxis, early diagnosis, and adequate treatment of neurologic complications are key elements in the management of vasospasm if neurologic damage, lengthy hospital stays, and increased use of health care resources are to be avoided </plain></SENT>
