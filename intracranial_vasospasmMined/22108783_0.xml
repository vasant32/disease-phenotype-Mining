<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular time constant (τ) estimates how fast cerebral blood arrives in cerebral arterial bed after each heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate the pattern of changes in τ following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), with specific emphasis on the temporal profile of changes in relation to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Simultaneous recordings of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) blood flow velocity (CBFV) in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were performed daily in patients after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 22 patients (10 males and 12 females; median age: 48 years, range: 34-84 years) recordings done before spasm were compared to those done during spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was confirmed with TCD (mean CBFV in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> &gt; 120 cm/s and Lindegaard ratio &gt; 3). τ was estimated as a product of compliance of cerebral arteries (C (a)) and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C (a) and CVR were estimated using mathematical transformations of ABP and CBFV waveforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vasospasm caused shortening of τ on both the spastic (before: 0.20 ± 0.05 s vs. spasm: 0.14 ± 0.04 s, P &lt; 0.0008) and contralateral side (before: 0.22 ± 0.05 s vs. spasm: 0.16 ± 0.04 s, P &lt; 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before TCD signs of vasospasm were detected, τ demonstrated asymmetry with lower values on ipsilateral side to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, in comparison to contralateral side (P &lt; 0.009), CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> causes shortening of τ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Shorter τ at the side of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> can be observed before formal TCD signs of vasospasm are observed, therefore, potentially reducing time to escalation of treatment </plain></SENT>
