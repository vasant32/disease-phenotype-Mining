<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSW induces excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> and osmotic <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp>, and reduces total blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, the risk of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may be elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to determine the mechanism of CSW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the rat SAH model exhibits CSW and to investigate the relationship between CSW and natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A SAH model was produced in 24 rats by perforating a cerebral artery with a nylon thread up through the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate CSW, urine was cumulatively collected from SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to 12 hours and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (Na) excretion was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body weight and hematocrit were analyzed before and after SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP) and brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) in plasma were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Urine volume and total Na excretion of SAH rats were significantly higher than those of sham rats (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body weight of SAH rats significantly decreased and hematocrit significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ANP concentration was significantly decreased in SAH rats (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, BNP concentrations did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated for the first time that a rat SAH model exhibited CSW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that the cause of CSW was neither ANP nor BNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, this rat SAH model will be useful for study of CSW after SAH </plain></SENT>
