<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ET-1 levels in the cerebral basilar arteries were estimated by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of ET-1 and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were determined by Western blotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes of cerebral basilar artery histology were observed and diameters were measured by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the ET-1 levels at 3h after scald were enhanced, peaking at 12h; the expression of ET-1 mRNA was also enhanced, peaking at 6h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous vascular remodelling was observed in the cerebral basilar arteries, vasoconstriction peaking at 12h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that ET-1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of scald-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and cerebral circulation disorder </plain></SENT>
