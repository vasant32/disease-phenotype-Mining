<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: While it is probable that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> which occurs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> results from the action of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, the mechanism of that process remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies were thus designed to test the hypothesis that the action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> results from the iron-catalyzed formation of free radicals and subsequent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation resulting in intracellular changes in the second messengers for contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Levels of intracellular calcium and of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> (1,4,5)-trisphosphate were measured in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells derived from primate cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contractility of rings of canine cerebral vessels were examined in vitro using standard pharmacological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vessels in spasm were obtained from the "two haemorrhage" canine model and the presence of vasospasm was confirmed angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each case, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> and sometimes of free radicals generated from iron salts were examined in the presence and in the absence of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> scavenging agents or the iron chelating agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> produces a slowly-developing sustained contraction of arterial rings which is accompanied by a sustained elevation of intracellular calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also produces a transient but significant elevation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, but this is not correlated with the development of sustained constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">Deferoxamine</z:chebi> and the lazaroid compounds U-74389G and U-83836E were effective in preventing the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> and free radicals in the models tested, although in vessels in spasm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> effects were smaller </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides results which are consistent with the hypothesis that the actions of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> on vascular smooth muscle are mediated by the formation of free radicals which subsequently affect intracellular calcium concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This also implies that agents which impair free radical production or other processes leading to iron-catalyzed <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, are of potential value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
