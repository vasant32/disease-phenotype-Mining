<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed Fourier analysis of the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity waveform envelope in 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (group A) and 15 patients, of whom five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (group B), five had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (group C), and five had arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements were obtained under conditions of normocapnia, <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Fourier coefficients measured in the first five harmonics of the Doppler waveforms of group A were used as the reference baseline and were compared with the coefficients found in the other three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group B showed significantly lower Fourier coefficients, while groups C and D showed higher coefficients (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The elevation of the Fourier coefficients occurred in an alternating pattern in group C and a decremental pattern in group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This distinction was attributed to possible differences in the underlying pathophysiological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of vascular distensibility of the cerebral arterioles, inferred from the shape of the Fourier analysis curves, was compared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular distensibility was characterized as abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, vasospasm, and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourier coefficients may be better indicators of cerebrovascular abnormalities than mean blood flow velocity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and pulsatility index in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, vasospasm, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
