<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The appropriate time to perform surgery for posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversy exists secondary to the lack of information regarding the overall management and outcome, as well as difficulties with their surgical treatment and infrequent occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the results of 46 patients with ruptured vertebro-basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with a delayed surgical protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four were Hunt-Hess grade I/II on admission, 13 were grade III, and 9 grade IV/V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (40%) (4 grade I/II, 6 grade III, and the 9 grade IV/V on admission) died before meeting the required conditions for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were vasospasm (8 cases), direct effect of the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (7 cases), and rebleeding (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical results were excellent/good in 87% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical mortality was 8% (2 out of 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, despite encouraging surgical results, overall mortality was disappointingly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that as more experience is gained in treating vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, early surgery should be performed in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early surgery is prophylactic for rebleeding and allows for more aggressive treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
