<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the contents of the plasmal NE, E and <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> increase remarkably, compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group(P &lt; 0.01), and accompanied by the increase of volume of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or the gravity of the disease </plain></SENT>
