<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>NPY is a putative neurotransmitter mainly co-localized with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> in sympathetic fibers which innervate the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The origin of most of the perivascular NPY fibers seems to be in the superior cervical ganglion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate involvement of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), twenty patients with SAH were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NPY-LI (-like immunoreactivity) levels in the external jugular vein were assessed using radioimmunoassay in blood samples collected post-operatively (or after SAH in non-surgical patients) on days 1,2,3, 5,7 and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These levels were compared with the clinical course and blood flow velocity changes monitored with ultrasonic Doppler equipment from both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and both internal carotid arteries (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to NPY-LI levels in 14 controls (mean 116 +/- 3 pmol/1), increased levels (up to 253 pmol/l) and a close relationship between velocities and NPY-LI levels were found in a subpopulation of the SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When comparing the mean haemodynamic index (V <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/ipsilateral V ICA) and mean NPY-LI levels in each of the 20 patients, a correlation of r = 0.75, p = 0.0001 was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased NPY-LI were found (131 +/- 8 pmol/l) when simultaneous Doppler velocity recordings showed vasoconstriction (Haemodynamic index greater than 5) compared with samples taken when the haemodynamic index was less than 5, p less than 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity exceeded 120 cm/sec. increased levels were found (129 +/- 9 pmol/l) compared with the conditions when <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity was less than 120 cm/sec (113 +/- 5 pmol/l), p = 0.06 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate a possible NPY involvement in cerebral vasoconstriction after SAH </plain></SENT>
