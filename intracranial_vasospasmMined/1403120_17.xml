<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 25 rats, platelet-rich plasma or fresh autologous whole blood containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, or 15 mg/ml was applied to the adventitial surface of the femoral artery in a Silastic cuff to insure <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure to the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, contralateral femoral arteries exposed to whole blood showed a 70% reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional area and morphological changes associated with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of platelet-rich plasma or whole blood containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> at 25 mg/ml produced no significant arterial narrowing or structural changes; significant intermediate reductions in arterial narrowing were observed at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presaturation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (10 mg/ml) with excess ferric ion prior to application eliminated the protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> chelated the ferric ion released from incubated whole blood in vitro over 7 days in a dose-dependent manner consistent with its protective effect in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ferric ion may influence the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> arterial narrowing after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> by a variety of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
