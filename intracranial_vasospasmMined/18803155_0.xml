<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: During the clinical course of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is one of the most dreaded medical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the usefulness of transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound imaging in diagnosing vasospasm in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) who were attended in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 89 patients with SAH of a non-traumatic origin; these patients had been admitted to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit and were submitted to a contrast-enhanced neurovascular study and daily monitoring with TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values were determined for the sensitivity, specificity, predictive power and overall precision of the TCD ultrasound imaging, together with the differences in mean flow rate and the coefficient of correlation between the gold standard test and the results of monitoring with TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Female patients under 50 years of age with favourable initial clinical degrees were predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmal SAH was prevalent and the frequency of angiographic vasospasm was 40%, in the majority of cases located in the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients had mean cerebral blood flow rates of or below 120 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The peaks of mean blood flow rate were obtained between the fourth and the tenth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall precision, sensitivity and the predictive negative value of TCD were good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specificity was excellent for flow rates below 130 cm/s, and the predictive positive value was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring with TCD proved to be useful for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients with a good initial clinical status </plain></SENT>
