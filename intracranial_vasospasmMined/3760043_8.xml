<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A double-isotope technique for the simultaneous measurement of CBF and CMRglu was applied to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) model in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cisternal injection of 0.07 ml blood caused a rather uniform 20% reduction in CBF together with an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization of 30% during the late phase of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one-third of the SAH animals, there were focal areas where the flow was lowered to 30% of the control values and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake increased to approximately 250% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that blood in the subarachnoid space via a neural mechanism induces the global flow and metabolic changes, and that the foci are caused by vasospasm superimposed on the global flow and metabolic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the double-isotope autoradiographic technique, [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> were used for CBF and CMRglu measurements, respectively, in the same animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In half of the sections, the [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine was extracted using 2,2-dimethoxypropane before the section was placed on a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29302">3H-</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-sensitive film </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other sections were placed on x-ray film with an emulsion insensitive to 3H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The validity of the double-isotope method was tested by comparing the data with those obtained in animals receiving a single isotope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CBF and metabolic values obtained in the two groups were similar </plain></SENT>
