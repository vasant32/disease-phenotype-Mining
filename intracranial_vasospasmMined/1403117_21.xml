<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To help settle this controversy, the authors used an in vivo label of cell division, bromodeoxycytidine, to assess cell proliferation in a primate model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cynomolgus monkeys received a clot of either whole blood (11 animals) or red blood cells (four animals) placed around the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the day of surgery continuous intravenous infusion of bromodeoxycytidine was begun and continued until the animal was sacrificed immediately after arteriography on Day 7, 12, or 27 following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections from the right and left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>'s were stained with a monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxcytidine, and labeled cells were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arteriographic evidence of vasospasm occurred in nine monkeys on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On Day 12 and Day 27 no monkeys had persistent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Placement of subarachnoid clot around the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> increased proliferative activity across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of the labeled cells were in the adventitia and the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although there were more dividing cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> than the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.01), the number of stained cells per section was limited (range 0.1 to 21.2, mean 8) and the occurrence of vasospasm was not associated with the number of dividing cells in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on Day 7, 12, 27, or for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> days combined (p &gt; 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH was not associated with the extent of proliferation of cells in the vessel wall, nor could the intensity of the limited proliferative changes have been responsible for narrowing of the vessel diameter </plain></SENT>
