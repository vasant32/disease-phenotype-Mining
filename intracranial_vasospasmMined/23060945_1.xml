<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury and delayed neurological deficits due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) are major determinants of outcomes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) had been used to treat patients with SAH, the supporting evidence and underlying mechanisms have not been systematically reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, the overview of studies of HBO for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is followed by a discussion of HBO molecular mechanisms involved in the protection against SAH-induced brain injury and even, as hypothesized, in attenuating vascular spasm alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Faced with the paucity of information as to what degree HBO is capable of antagonizing vasospasm after SAH, the authors postulate that the major beneficial effects of HBO in SAH include a reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury and combating brain damage caused by CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, authors reviewed the effects of HBO on SAH-induced hypoxic signaling and other mechanisms of neurovascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, authors hypothesize that HBO administered after SAH may "precondition" the brain against the detrimental sequelae of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the existing evidence speaks in favor of administering HBO in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and delayed phase after SAH; however, further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and to establish the optimal regimen of treatment </plain></SENT>
