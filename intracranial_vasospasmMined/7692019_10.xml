<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the possible role of immunological reaction in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the authors examined the prophylactic effect of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> agents FK-506 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm in a canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While a mean constriction of the basilar artery to 81.0% +/- 4.0% (+/- standard error of the mean) occurred on Day 2 and to 63.8% +/- 3.5% on Day 7 in the untreated group, constriction to 77.9% +/- 3.4% on Day 2 and 62.8% +/- 3.0% on Day 7 was demonstrated in the FK-506-treated group (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This tendency was also noted in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>-treated group, with basilar artery constriction to 81.8% +/- 3.7% and 56.3% +/- 2.7%, respectively (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histological changes of the basilar artery, including corrugation of the elastic lamina, detachment of endothelial cells, and vacuolar formation in the smooth-muscle layer were not different in the two treated groups and the one control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> agents are known to inhibit the release of interleukin-2 (IL-2), the level of IL-2 was examined in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While interleukin-1 gradually increased in level as time passed, the level of IL-2 was consistently low during the course of the study, indicating less participation of IL-2 in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This clinical observation matched the experimental results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that cell-mediated immunoreaction, initiated mainly by IL-2, plays little role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
