<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi>) on the clinical course of patients with severe aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with Fisher Grade 3 aneurysmal SAH were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were given a bolus as well as a constant infusion of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> up to 10 days postictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> levels were obtained to adjust the daily requirement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal was to raise the serum level to 2.0 to 2.5 mmol/L or twice the baseline serum level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography was performed on each patient, insonating both anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further management followed standard protocols, including the use of nimodipine and hypervolemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD ultrasonographic findings, as well as clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a 3-month assessment using the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After administration of a 20 mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> bolus infusion and an average daily continuous infusion of 84.7 mmol, 8 of 10 patients achieved the predetermined serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No adverse affects were noted during the infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients exhibited evidence of vasospasm on TCD ultrasonography; vasospasm was severe in two patients (velocities, &gt;200 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients, including the two patients in whom TCD ultrasonography demonstrated severe vasospasm, exhibited clinical evidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 3; the remainder had Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Administration guidelines for the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> in aneurysmal SAH were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial is required to establish the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> for treating vasospasm in aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
