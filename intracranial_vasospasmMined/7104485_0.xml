<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There exists a considerable difference in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> between the intracranial and the extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arteries are already stiff at birth and become stiffer with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their increase in stiffness is attributable to the marked thickening of their walls, which compensates for the decrease of their elastic modulus with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pressure-diameter curve of the intracranial vertebral arteries subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is biphasic and has a sharp flexion at the pressure of 180 mmHg when their smooth muscle is activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pressure elevation yields little change of diameter in the strongly constricted vessel up to the pressure level at the flexion point, above which the constriction is released abruptly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The existence of flexion point at a high pressure level is an important mechanical feature in considering the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> produced by the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
