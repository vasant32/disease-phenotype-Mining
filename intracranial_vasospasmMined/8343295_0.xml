<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 23 patients who were admitted because of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> during three years from March, 1989 to March, 1992 and in whom plasma ANP and ADH levels could be determined over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was evaluated by the finding of cerebral angiography, clinical symptoms, and presence or not of low density areas on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>Hyponatremia</z:hpo> was defined as the serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> level of 130 mEq/l or less for two days or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographical vasospasm was found in 17 patients (85%), symptomatic vasospasm in 15 patients (65.2%), low density areas on CT in 9 patients (40.9%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> in 8 patients (34.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm was noted in 7 of the 8 patients (87.5%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, low density areas on CT in 4 patients (50%), the detection rate being high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma ANP and ADH levels were 76.7 +/- 32.1 pg/ml and 2.2 +/- 0.7 pg/ml respectively in the patients with symptomatic vasospasm against 38.3 +/- 21.3 pg/ml and 2.4 +/- 0.6 pg/ml respectively without symptomatic vasospasm, the plasma ANP level being significantly high in the patients with symptomatic vasospasm (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma ANP and ADH were 71.2 +/- 33.8 pg/ml and 2.0 +/- 1.1 pg/ml respectively in the patients with low density areas on CT against 51.2 +/- 31.3 pg/ml and 1.8 +/- 0.5 pg/ml respectively without low density areas on CT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
