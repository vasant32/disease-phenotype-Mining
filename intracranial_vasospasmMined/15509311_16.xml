<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that fenestration of the lamina terminalis (FLT) during surgery may be associated with reduced rates of shunt-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report 106 patients affected by anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and Fisher Grade 3 aneurysmal SAH and the affect of FLT on shunt-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, vasospasm, and frontobasal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 3-year period, 53 patients underwent FLT and 53 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated admission and discharge clinical grades, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> at admission, occurrence of clinical vasospasm, need for interventional vasospasm therapy, frontobasal hypodensity incidence, and permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunting requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 3 to 35 months (mean, 17.9 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Shunting incidence after aneurysmal SAH with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was 4.25% in patients who underwent FLT and 13.9% in patients who did not (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurred in 29.6% of patients who underwent FLT and in 54.7% of patients who did not (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frontobasal hypodensity was identified postoperatively in 0% of patients who underwent FLT and in 5% of patients who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was reported in 69.81% of patients who underwent FLT and in 33.96% of patients who did not (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome was associated with higher Hunt and Hess grades, need for ventricular drainage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e>, and multiple interventional vasospasm therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No complications were linked to FLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FLT was associated with statistically significant decreases in shunting rates, incidence of vasospasm, and better outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We recommend its routine use in patients with Fisher Grade 3 anterior communicating artery aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
