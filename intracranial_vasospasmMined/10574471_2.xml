<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous experimental data indicate the involvement of immune mechanisms in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endogenous opioids play also an important role in the ischemic lesions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) induces the release of beta-endorphin (beta-END) from hypothalamic neurons and also from mononuclear white blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The function of CRH and beta-END in vasospasm following SAH and the interrelationship between neuroendocrine and immune changes requires further elucidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the influence of CRH injected into cerebral cisterna magna (CM) of rats on beta-END-like level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following artificial SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acutely CRH induced a significant rise of beta-END-like in CSF both in SAH and sham SAH rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in rats subjected to SAH, a single injection of CRH caused a prolonged rise of 5-END in CSF, which was also seen 2 days after SAH, during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The obtained results indicate that CRH increases neuroendocrine changes induced by SAH, probably by an activation of immune cells involved in the patomechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
