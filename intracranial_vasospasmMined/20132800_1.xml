<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, effective inhibitors of TLR4 activation, may modulate the vasospasm progression via their anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigate whether the blood component <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (OxyHb) can induce the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and evaluate the modulatory effects of PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on OxyHb-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in VSMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cultured VSMCs incubated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> were exposed to OxyHb at 10muM for up to 48h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of TLR4 was assessed by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
