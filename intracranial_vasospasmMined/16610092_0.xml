<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical records and radiographic images of 118 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> admitted during last 5 years were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence,degree and localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were evaluated, and morbidity of related DIND was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were divided into three groups: Group <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (middle cerebral artery), Group ACA (anterior cerebral artery) and Group ICA (intracranial carotid artery) according to the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consistency of DIND and image of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: There was a weak correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and incidence of DIND (r=0.22; P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of DIND was increased with severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (U=2.589, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The group <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> had a significantly higher incidence of DIND than that of ACA and ICA groups (68.0% compared with 36.7% and 25.0%, respectively, chi(2)=8.195, P=0.004), the difference between later two groups was not statistically significant (chi(2)=0.646, P=0.421) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may be an important factor leading to DIND occurrence; the severity and location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is related to the incidence of DIND </plain></SENT>
