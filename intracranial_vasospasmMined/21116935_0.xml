<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An online search of the MEDLINE PubMed and EMBASE medical databases (1969 to week 21 of 2007) was performed using the key words "mice", "rat", "rabbit", "canine", and "primate" in combination with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>", "model", and "vasospasm" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven techniques were mainly used to induce experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in closed and open cranium approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the great number of experimental SAH methods and associated parameters only a fistful reliable models can be identified and recommended for experimental work in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
