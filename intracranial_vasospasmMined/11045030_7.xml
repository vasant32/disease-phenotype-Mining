<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drug-release kinetics of copoly(lactic/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17497">glycolic acid</z:chebi>) pellet containing nicardipine were evaluated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo, 18 dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups, i.e. placebo, low-dose (0.8 mg), or high-dose (8 mg) nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed, followed by right craniectomy, the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and the placement of the pellets in the Sylvian fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Day 7 and Day 14, the angiography was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first four days, 61.9% of the actual nicardipine loaded was released and within 10 days, 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average percent reductions of vessel diameters in the middle cerebral artery on Day 7 were 43%, 14% and 7% in the placebo, low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively (p = 0.0319) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of nicardipine in the clots on Day 14 was 9.7 x 10(-7) mol-1 l-1 and 5.1 x 10(-6) mol-1 l-1 in the low-dose and high-dose group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This drug delivery system prevented vasospasm in dogs significantly even at low dose, while maintaining an appropriate concentration of nicardipine in the clot adjacent to the arteries </plain></SENT>
