<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated initially by surgical clipping of the left middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the neurological status of the patient was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six days later, the patient presented right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> that were related to the proximal left middle cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite recent open-skull surgery, in situ thrombolysis using urokinase and antip late let antibodies (abciximab) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thrombosed artery was reopened and a severe vasospasm was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vasospasm was treated by transluminal angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was noted after thrombolysis and angioplasty, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001933'>subcutaneous hemorrhage</z:hpo> around the scalp incision was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered from motor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only long-term symptom was a mild dysorthographia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Balance of risk/benefit is discussed for such aggressive thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this particular case, effectiveness and uneventful use of abciximab was demonstrated despite very recent brain surgery that was considered a formal contra-indication for the use of such a powerful thrombolytic drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is an exceptional complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the early hours, intra-arterial thrombolysis may be considered, but recent intracranial surgery is usually an exclusion criterion to performing thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient who underwent thrombolysis and angioplasty in the postoperative period to treat this complication of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
