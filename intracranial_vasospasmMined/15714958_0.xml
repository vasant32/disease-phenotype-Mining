<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, as optimum dose and duration of action remain unknown, the present study aimed to clarify these variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed intra-arterial injection of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> for eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> 7-13 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> was administered via the internal carotid artery without selective microcatheterization, at a concentration and speed of 30 mg/20 ml/10-15 min, using a total dose of 30-60 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was used to measure change in blood vessel diameter at 19 points, and perfusion CT was used to detect changes in cerebral blood perfusion (CBP), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) at 12 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Investigations were performed before IA, immediately after IA (post IA), and 4.5 to 6 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For central vessels, (A1, M1) mean change in diameter (cm) measured pre IA, post IA, and 4.5-6 hours later was 1.2 +/- 0.68, 1.5 +/- 0.72, and 1.2 +/- 0.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For peripheral vessels (peripheral to A1, M1, and the ophthalmic artery) change in diameter (cm) was 0.65 +/- 0.16, 0.97 +/- 0.24, and 0.71 +/- 0.24, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average CBP (m/100g/min) in the infused hemisphere at pre IA, post IA, and 4.5-6 hours later was 41.6 +/- 3.56, 46.4 +/- 5.82, 41.6 +/- 7.42, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average CBV (ml/100g) was 2.72 +/- 0.21, 2.73 +/- 0.21, 2.91 +/- 0.42, respectively and average <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>) was 5.16 +/- 0.38, 4.57 +/- 0.70, 5.55 +/- 1.0, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in peripheral vessel diameter and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, when performing intra-arterial administration of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, clinicians should be aware that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effect is less than 6 hours </plain></SENT>
