<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is a widespread and potentially treatable complication after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aggressive treatment often includes hemodynamic augmentation, although the exact mechanism by which such therapy leads to improved cerebral blood flow and reduced neurologic deficits is incompletely established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case report is only the second to provide compelling evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can lead to direct dilation of vasospastic arteries, thereby providing valuable insight into its potential mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a patient with SAH from a ruptured anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> who developed marked decline in mental status on posthemorrhage day 11, consistent with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic cerebral angiogram was performed demonstrating extensive and diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After receiving a nonselective slow infusion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, the patient developed an episode of extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiography immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0100735'>hypertensive crisis</z:hpo> revealed near-complete resolution of the previously noted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rapid improvement in the patient's neurologic status ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present case illustrates that extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can lead to direct dilation of vasospastic arteries and suggests that hypertensive-type hemodynamic therapy may act not only through increasing the pressure gradient across vasospastic arteries but also via direct induction of arterial vasodilation </plain></SENT>
