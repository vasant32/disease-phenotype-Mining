<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using a single sending and receiving fiber, an optical backscatter measurement (500-800 nm) was used to monitor the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (DH), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase (rCO), and relative tissue blood content in a closed cranium preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anesthetized rats were prepared by cannulating a branch of the internal carotid artery and subjected to either bolus infusions (1.25 or 2.5 microM <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> in Ringers/g tissue) or to constant infusions of 5 or 10% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> at various rates (0.30-2.92 microM/g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To facilitate optical penetration, a portion of the left parietal cranium was shaved to a translucent appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that low, bolus doses of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> typically produced a slight increase (5-10%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> signal, indicating that vasodilation had probably occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher doses, however, produced a prompt and significant reduction in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> signal, increased levels of DH, and a rise in rCO suggesting a vasoconstrictor response leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> had occurred, followed by recovery within 3-5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Constant infusions of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> produced a similar cerebral vascular response, in a dose-related manner, but of a more sustained nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At levels of 50-60% of the maximum bolus dose, the effect was more pronounced, accompanied by an increase in the levels of rCO (by 50-90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Control experiments using identical volumes/flow rates of Ringers solution produced no significant alterations in the optical spectrum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
