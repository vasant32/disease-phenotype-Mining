<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Special fixation, frozen sections, and toluidine blue staining are essential for counting the number of mast cells in tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological preparations for counting mast cells were made from arteries of the circle of Willis in persons who died after chest or abdominal trauma (control group) and in patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The arteries were removed within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, taking care to avoid damage to their structure, and were immersed in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This preliminary note, reporting findings in only a few cases, is justified by the interesting discovery of a marked increase in mast cell population in the muscular layer of arteries after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The series is small because of the difficulty in obtaining suitable material, since mast cells virtually disappear when autopsy is performed later than 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded from this study that there is an increase of mast cell population in cerebral arterial walls after SAH, mainly in the muscular layer, and that the number of mast cells is higher in arteries closer to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
