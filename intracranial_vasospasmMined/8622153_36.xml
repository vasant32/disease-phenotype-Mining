<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A water-soluble, novel synthetic compound, AVS ((+/-)-N, N'-propylenedinicotinamide; nicaraven) has no demonstrable vasoactive properties but scavenges <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> in aqueous environmental conditions at neutral pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of preceding experimental and clinical studies showing marked ameliorative effects of AVS on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and ischemic brain damage, a multicenter, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial was undertaken to verify its beneficial effects on delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) due to vasospasm and on the overall outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 162 patients with SAH who had Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores between 7 and 15 on admission were enrolled in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug administration (4 g AVS or 4 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as placebo; infused intravenously for 6-8 hours once a day) was begun within 5 days post-SAH and continued for 10 to 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intent-to-treat analysis of these patients revealed that the overall incidence of DINDs, which was defined as an exacerbation of impaired consciousness and/or focal neurological deficits, was significantly reduced, by 34.5% (placebo 54.2%, AVS 35.5%; p &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at 1 month was significantly improved by AVS (p &lt; 0.05, U-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, the difference in the GOS scores between the groups became marginal on U-tests (p &lt; 0.10), but the percentage of good outcome tended to increase, with a relative increase of 20.3% (AVS 76.3%, placebo 63.4%; p &lt; 0.10, chi-square test), and the cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant adverse reaction attributable to treatment was observed. the usefulness of AVS in therapy for SAH is strongly indicated by the fact that the agent significantly ameliorated DINDs, leading to a marked improvement in the GOS scores at 1 month, as well as a reduction in the cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by 3 months </plain></SENT>
