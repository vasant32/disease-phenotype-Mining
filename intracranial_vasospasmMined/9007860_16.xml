<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and any potential effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CycA) in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with Fisher Grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a loading dose of 7.5 mg/kg of CycA was administered every 12 hours for two doses, enteral treatment with CycA was started within 72 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole blood CycA levels were titrated to maintain levels of 50 to 400 ng/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial doppler ultrasonography was performed daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery velocities were used to assess the degree of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed to confirm the vasospasm in symptomatic patients, or it was performed if transcranial doppler ultrasonograms were unobtainable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with a standard pharmacological regimen of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, hemodilution, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> were instituted at the discretion of the neurosurgical team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial papaverine was infused into the vasospastic vessels of three recalcitrant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed at 6 months with the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients displayed evidence of vessel narrowing, which was disclosed by transcranial doppler ultrasonography or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five patients developed ischemic deficits, two were treated with intra-arterial papaverine, and three died of complications secondary to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant hepatic, renal, or infectious complication developed as a result of the administration of CycA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CycA proved safe to use but failed to prevent the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> or delayed ischemic deficits in patients considered at high risk </plain></SENT>
