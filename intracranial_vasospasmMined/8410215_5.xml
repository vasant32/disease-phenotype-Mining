<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was investigated by serial measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) using the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 emission tomography method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CBF was measured before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On Day 2 after SAH, there was early local hyperperfusion in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory, ipsilateral to the left posterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regional CBF of this arterial territory decreased slightly after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection, probably because of vasoplegia and the "steal" phenomenon, and thus surgery was delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and disturbed consciousness occurred 4 days later (on Day 6 after SAH) due to arterial vasospasm, despite treatment with a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium-channel blocker</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial hyperemia of the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory was followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vasodilation induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> administration was significantly subnormal until Day 13, at which time CBF and vasoreactivity amplitude returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the patient's clinical condition improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgery on Day 14 and outcome were without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that serial CBF measurements plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection are useful for monitoring the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> to determine the most appropriate time for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
