<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that cytotoxic effects of ferrous Hb on smooth muscle cells contribute to vasospasm was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultured rat basilar artery smooth muscle cells were exposed to pure Hb, dog erythrocyte hemolysate, or Hb breakdown products; and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase (HO-1 and HO-2) and ferritin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was assessed by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release and fluorescence assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pure Hb or hemolysate caused dose- and time-dependent increases in HO-1 mRNA and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">Hemin</z:chebi> was the component of Hb that increased HO-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">Cycloheximide</z:chebi> inhibited the increase in HO-1 mRNA in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ferritin protein heavy chain but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased upon exposure of cells to Hb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">Hemin</z:chebi> and ferric but not ferrous Hb were toxic to smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was increased by exposure to Hb plus tin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, exposure of smooth muscle cells to Hb induces HO-1 mRNA and protein through pathways that involve new protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">Hemin</z:chebi> is the component of Hb that induces HO-1 </plain></SENT>
