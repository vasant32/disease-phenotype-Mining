<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One step toward gene therapy to prevent spasm of cerebral vessels is to determine whether subarachnoid blood prevents transgene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vasospasm was induced in mongrel dogs using the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> intracranial-injection model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diameter of the basilar artery was assessed by angiography, and profound vasospasm (&gt; 50% decrease in diameter) was demonstrated at 4 and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recombinant adenovirus expressing nuclear-targeted beta-galactosidase (reporter gene) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was injected into the cisterna magna at the same time as (n = 9) or 2 days after (n = 4) injection of blood for induction of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed and examined histochemically for expression of nuclear beta-galactosidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 2 to 7 days, beta-galactosidase was expressed in leptomeninges over the brain stem, cortex, cerebral arteries, in small vessels in the cerebrum and brain stem, and in the ependymal lining of the ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transgene expression was observed in adventitia of blood vessels but not in vascular muscle or endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transgene expression was observed after simultaneous injection of virus and blood or when virus was injected 2 days after blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that intracisternal injection of recombinant adenovirus can be used for gene transfer to cerebral blood vessels and overlying meninges, even in the presence of cisternal blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We speculate that transfer of genes using recombinant <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vectors that encode for enzymes with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> function to cerebral blood vessels and perivascular tissues may be useful for prevention or treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
