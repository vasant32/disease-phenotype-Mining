<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31690">imatinib mesylate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases of PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in rats, and to elucidate if tenascin-C (TNC), a matricellular protein, is involved in the mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">Imatinib</z:chebi> (10 or 50 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally to rats undergoing SAH by endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and the effects were evaluated by neurobehavioral tests and India-ink angiography at 24-72 h post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms in cerebral arteries at 24h post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recombinant TNC was administered intracisternally to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>-treated SAH rats, and the effects were evaluated by neurobehavioral tests, India-ink angiography and immunohistochemistry at 24 h post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both dosages of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> significantly prevented post-SAH neurological impairments and vasospasm at 24-72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAH caused PDGFR-Î² upregulation, PDGFR activation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase activation, and TNC upregulation in the spastic cerebral arteries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were significantly suppressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recombinant TNC reversed the anti-vasospastic effects and protein expression changes by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> at least partly via inhibiting the upregulation of TNC, implying that TNC may be a new therapeutic target for post-SAH vasospasm </plain></SENT>
