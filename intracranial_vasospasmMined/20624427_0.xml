<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize and evaluate the feasibility of an experimental SAH technique that mimics pathophysiological mechanisms and triggers higher degrees of DCVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: SAH was induced by extracranial-intracranial (EC/IC) shunting of blood from the subclavian artery into the great cerebral cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP), arterial blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gas analysis, and neurological status were monitored throughout the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of spasm was determined by comparison of pre-SAH (day 0) and post-SAH (day 3) angiograms and postmortem morphometric analysis of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 13 experiments (SAH, n=11; controls, n=2) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two animals died after initiation of the EC/IC blood shunt in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SAH animals, ICP (baseline: 12+/-1 [mean+/-SD]; peak: 51+/-4; steady-state level: 15+/-2 mm Hg) rose to diastolic blood pressure levels (56+/-3 mm Hg) within 98+/-20s, and fell to a steady state within 186+/-41 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SAH-induced vasoconstriction of the basilar artery was 53.1+/-2.8% on day 3 compared to baseline (P&lt;0.05) and histology confirmed marked vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel technique of SAH induction closely mimics the pathophysiological sequelae of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture and triggers constant higher degrees of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> than previously described rabbit models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The severity of vasospasm attained offers a unique opportunity to evaluate future therapeutic treatment options </plain></SENT>
