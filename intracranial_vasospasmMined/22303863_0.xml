<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Papaverine (P) and nimodipine (N) are the most widely used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> when angiographic and symptomatic vasospasm is present after subarachnoid aneurysmatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their effect is only short-lived and no direct comparisons have been undertaken to evaluate the action of both substances directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively assessed the effect of either P or N on angiographic diameter reduction and capillary blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen SAH patients with secured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> received intraarterial P, fifteen similar patients received N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the primary endpoint, pre- and post-infusion arterial diameters and capillary blood flow were rated retrospectively on angiographies and compared by RM-ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were the difference in the modified Rankin Scale between the two groups on admission and at discharge, the occurrence of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the separate effects on angiographic diameter and capillary blood flow and the overall response rate to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic resolution of diameter reduction and angiographically assessed capillary blood flow together differed not significantly between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P infusion dilated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> angiographic demonstrable vessels while N infusion was ineffective in 16% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Capillary flow on pre- and post-infusion angiographies was not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: P and N seem to differ in the effect on cerebral diameter reduction in patients with vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications remain to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A multimodal approach, perhaps combining different agents for intraarterial infusion in such patients, needs to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
