<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the status of thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filament regulation of smooth muscle contraction in the double-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> canine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and to determine the effects of a kinase inhibitor reported to be effective in vasospasm, HA1077, on thin and thick filament regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was assessed by vertebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation was measured using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> gels, whereas protein levels of the thin filament-associated protein calponin were measured by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basilar arteries of dogs in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced narrowed to 36% +/- 2.0% of their size on the first day (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain tended to increase, but the change did not reach statistical significance (35% +/- 5.9% [n = 12] versus 25% +/- 4.8% [n = 10] in control arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to this increase, significant degradation of calponin was observed in the samples from vasospastic dogs (85.4% +/- 5.45% [n = 5] versus 15.2% +/- 6.21% [n = 5]; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic treatment with intravenous injections of HA1077 at 0.67 mg/kg b.i.d. significantly inhibited vasospasm (diameters, 65% +/- 10.2% of Day 1 diameters [n = 5]; P &lt; 0.05), and calponin degradation (57.8% +/- 13.9% [n = 4]) was substantially reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that degradation of the thin filament-associated protein calponin plays a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and that the antivasospastic action of HA1077 is, at least in part, due to prevention of calponin degradation </plain></SENT>
