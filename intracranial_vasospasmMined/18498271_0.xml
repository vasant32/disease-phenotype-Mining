<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This haemorrhage is typically diffuse and located in extracerebral subarachnoid space in which main cerebral arterial branches are situated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intimate and long-term contact of arterial wall and blood products in the closed space causes the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> as a serious and frequent complication of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is connected with significant morbidity and mortality due to developing of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and subsequently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our experimental research was to create the animal model of vasospasm using the femoral artery due to examination of reduced basic dilator activity cause in arterial wall after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The important characteristic of major cerebral arteries is their localization in the closed subarachnoid space which enables their to have long-term contact with blood products after haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty six femoral arteries (FA) of eighteen female rats weighing about 300 g were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, femoral arteries are microsurgically prepared in both inguinal regions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen arteries were encompassed by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) material forming closed tube and autologous blood was injected in the tube around the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional eighteen arteries, as a control group, were also put in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> tube but without exposing to the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats are left to live for eight days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, rats were sacrificed and their arteries were in vitro examined including an isometric tension measurement and histological changes analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The tension was measured during application of vasoconstrictors and vasodilatators (nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FA exposed to periadventitial blood exhibit hyper reactivity to constrictors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>) compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was also found that NO donor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>) diminished arterial spasm induced by blood and vasoconstrictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FA can be used as a model for vasospasm correlating with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH and therefore this model can be utilized in future experiments assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The reduced basic dilator activity of spastic femoral artery is caused by an absence of gaseous messenger NO next to the arteries but not by diminished response vasculature to NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Absence of NO after SAH probably causes the reduced basic dilator activity of cerebral arteries as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The guanylate-cyclase level in the arterial wall is consequently reduced after SAH primary due to absence of NO but not due to direct reduction of enzyme activities caused by process of blood degradation inside of subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
