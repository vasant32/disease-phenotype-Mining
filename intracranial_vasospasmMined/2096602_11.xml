<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The initial dose-escalating clinical trial of a novel calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, AT877, in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AT877 is characterized by its strong spasmolytic activity, its inhibition of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> activity, and the inhibition of several protein kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 113 patients (Hunt and Hess grades I to IV) who had undergone surgery within 3 days of aneurysmal rupture entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 5 groups according to the total daily dose of AT877: I: 20 mg; II: 40 mg; III: 60 mg; IV: 90 mg; and V: 120-180 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AT877 was given by intravenous infusion over 30 min two or three times a day for 14 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although AT877 did not completely abolish angiographic vasospasm, severe vasospasm was seen less frequently in patients given higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was the cause of a poor clinical outcome (Glasgow outcome scale rating 3 or greater) in 19%, 7%, 9%, 8%, and 6% of the patients in groups I to V, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated a favourable clinical effect of AT877 at doses above 40 mg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was seen, even when 60 mg of AT877 was infused over 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AT877 appears to be effective in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Part of its effect may be attributable to protection of the brain from ischaemic insults due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the drug still needs to be evaluated in a placebo-controlled double-blind trial (which is currently being carried out) </plain></SENT>
