<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we sought to examine whether inhibition of p38 MAPK could attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and investigate the underlying mechanisms in a rabbit SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAH was established in rabbits (n=12/group) using the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed apparent vasospasm in the basilar arteries of rabbits with SAH, which was significantly attenuated by SB203580, a selective p38MAPK inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting assays showed enhanced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ATF2 and increased caspase-3 cleavage following SAH, which were, however, markedly suppressed by SB203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TUNEL staining further revealed significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the basilar arteries of rabbits with SAH, which was scantly present in rabbits treated with SB203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that p38 MAPK was activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in the basilar arteries and p38 MAPK inhibition suppressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting that p38 MAPK could be a novel therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
