<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gap junction participates in the pathologic processes of cerebrovascular diseases and may play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the role of connexin43 in ET-1-induced contraction in rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ET-1-induced contraction without or with carbenoxolone was studied with an isometric tension system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of connexin43 protein in ET-1-stimulated basilar arteries was studied with Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scrape/scratch method was used to analyse the function of gap junction in cultured rabbit cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) ET-1 produced a concentration-dependent contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carbenoxolone inhibited ET-1-induced contraction; (2) connexin43 protein level is increased in ET-1-stimulated basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carbenoxolone decreases the connexin43 protein level increased by ET-1; (3) cells treated with ET-1 appeared positive communicate and the dye transfer was increased in a time-dependent fashion; 4 carbenoxolone suppressed the ET-1-induced increases in dye transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The enhancement of gap junction intercellular communication is activated by ET-1 via modulating the expression of connexin43, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting vascular GJIC as a means of reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH may be of therapeutic advantage </plain></SENT>
