<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Collagen lattice contraction has been reported as another aspect of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, some authors have suggested that matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) plays an important role in collagen lattice contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aimed to clarify a role of MMP-1 during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rat SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We used a single-SAH model in rats and assessed the basilar arteries (BAs) at 30 minutes and on 2 days after SAH by cross-sectional area measurement and other histological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used to quantify MMP-1 expression and activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BAs in rats significantly exhibited severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> at 30 minutes after SAH and moderate vasospasm on Day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry and Western blotting performed in BAs of rats demonstrated that both expression and activation in MMP-1 peaked at 30 minutes after SAH and then declined to the control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MMP-1 is expressed and activated in a parallel time course to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in an experimental model of SAH </plain></SENT>
