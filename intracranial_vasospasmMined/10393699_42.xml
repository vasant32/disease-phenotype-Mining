<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, the pathogenesis and gene expression associated with vasospasm remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study used fluorescent differential display to identify differentially expressed genes in a rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using quantitative RT-PCR, we found that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was prominently induced in the basilar artery and modestly in brain tissue in a rat vasospasm model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between the degree of vasospasm and HO-1 mRNA levels in the basilar arteries exhibiting vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal injection of antisense HO-1 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) significantly delayed the clearance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> from the subarachnoid space and aggravated angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antisense HO-1 ODN inhibited HO-1 induction in the basilar arteries but not in the whole brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was not observed in the nontreated, sense HO-1 ODN-treated, or scrambled ODN-treated arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report the protective effects of HO-1 gene induction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH, a finding that should provide a novel therapeutic approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
