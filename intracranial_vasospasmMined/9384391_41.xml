<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The early surgical removal of subarachnoid clots and irrigation of the basal cisterns have been reported to reduce the incidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to surgery, the endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> does not allow removal of subarachnoid clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors measured the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm after early endovascular treatment of acutely ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients classified as Hunt and Hess Grades I to III underwent occlusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> via GDCs within 72 hours of rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amount of blood on the initial computerized tomography (CT) scan was classified by means of Fisher's scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm was defined as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological deterioration verified with angiographic or transcranial Doppler studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilution therapy, with or without intracranial angioplasty, was used to treat vasospasm after GDC placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 16 (23%) of 69 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical grade at admission and the amount of blood on the initial CT were both associated with the incidence of subsequent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 6-month clinical follow-up examination, 12 of these 16 patients experienced a good recovery, two were moderately disabled, and two patients had died of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the 23% incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in this series compares favorably with that found in conventional surgical series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that endovascular therapy does not have an unfavorable impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
