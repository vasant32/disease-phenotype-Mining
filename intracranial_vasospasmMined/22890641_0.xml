<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a drug delivery system using a vasodilating drug that can be implanted intracranially at the time of surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, without systemic side effects or side effects associated with long-term intrathecal drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We started our project on 1994 for making a slowly releasing drug delivery system in vitro because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurs 4-14 days following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rod-shaped pellet containing 1 mg of nicardipine for animal study was prepared by heat compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We presented the efficacy and safety of this drug delivery system using both canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and clot placement models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since October 1999, nicardipine prolonged-release implants (NPRIs) containing 4 mg of nicardipine have been used to prevent vasospasm in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NPRIs were placed in the cistern of the cerebral arteries, where thick clots existed; therefore, vasospasm related to delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) was highly probable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was completely prevented in the arteries by placing NPRIs adjacent to the arteries during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complications were experienced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have performed three studies (a single-center study with consecutive patients; a single-center, randomized, double-blind trial; and a multicenter cooperative study) and have proved that implantation of NPRIs reduces the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and DINDs and improves clinical outcome after SAH </plain></SENT>
