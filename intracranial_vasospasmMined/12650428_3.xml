<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+-permeable nonselective <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channels (NSCCs) are activated by several endothelium-derived constricting factors such as endothelin 1 (ET-1) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the receptor-operated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ channel blocker LOE 908 inhibits ET-1-induced extracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ influx via NSCCs in the VSMCs of the basilar artery (BA) and the NSCC-dependent part of ET-1-induced vasoconstriction of BA rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vivo role of LOE 908 on SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two Japanese white rabbits were assigned to seven groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment groups consisted of the following: 1) control rabbits without SAH that received a cisternal injection of saline; 2) rabbits with SAH that were subjected to the intravenous administration of saline; 3 through 6) rabbits with SAH that underwent the intravenous administration of 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg LOE 908, respectively; and 7) rabbits without SAH that underwent the intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg LOE 908 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autologous blood was injected into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The caliber of the BA was measured on angiographic studies before and after the cisternal injection of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intravenous injection of LOE 908 inhibited the magnitude of an SAH-induced vasosapsm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the concentration of LOE 908 required to relax vasospasm (1 mg/kg) correlated with that required to block <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ influx into VSMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ channel blocker LOE 908 may inhibit the magnitude of an SAH-induced vasospasm by blocking the influx of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ through NSCCs in rabbit BAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Blocking the NSCCs may represent a new treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
