<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate whether blocking functional endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity may offer a new approach to inhibit the development of cerebral vasopasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) by preventing transformation of big Endothelin-1 (big ET-1) to vasoactive Endothelin-1 (ET-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro, the effect of potential ECE inhibitors was determined by measurement of isometric contractions, induced by big ET-1, in isolated rat basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelium intact (E+) and de-endothelialized (E-) segments were examined after pre-incubated with the putative ECE inhibitors: Phosphoramidon (10(-4) M), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> (10(-3) M and 10(-4) M) and [(22)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32857">D-Val</z:chebi>] big ET-1 (16-38) (10(-5) M and 10(-6) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Application of 10(-4) M Phosphoramidon resulted in a statistically significant decrease in big ET-1 induced contraction in endothelium intact (E+) and de-endothelialized (E-) segments; 10(-3) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> in E- segments caused a statistically significant inhibitory effect; 10(-4) M and 10(-3) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> in E+ segments showed no statistically significant effect; 10(-5) M and 10(-6) M [(22)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32857">D-Val</z:chebi>] big ET-1 (16-38) in E- segments produced no statistically significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The application of 10(-6) M [(22)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32857">D-Val</z:chebi>] big ET-1 (16-38) in E+ segments caused increased contractions as shown by the shift to the left of the concentration-effect curve (CEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study indicates the existence of functional ECE activity in rat basilar artery, which is different in the endothelium and the smooth muscle layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This ECE-activity could be inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> and Phosporamidon, suggesting a potency for prevention and therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the structural analogue of big ET-1, [(22)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32857">D-Val</z:chebi>] big ET-1 (16-38), was ineffective in reducing big ET-1 induced vasoconstriction and rather increased contraction in E+ vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore further studies of the biochemical nature of the functional relevant cerebrovascular ECE activity are required for better understanding and development of other efficient ECE inhibitors </plain></SENT>
