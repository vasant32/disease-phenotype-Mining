<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are currently two accepted mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both are technically demanding and labor intensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report a reproducible and technically feasible method to induce SAH, and subsequently CVs, in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested this model in multiple strains of mice that are commonly used for genetic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH was induced in C57BL/6NCr, FVB, 129S1, BalbC and SJL mice, weighing 28-32 g, by an intracisternal vessel transection technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were perfused with India ink at 24h postprocedure and vessel diameters were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain slices were obtained for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining (H&amp;E) to look for vascular changes consistent with CVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no mortality during or after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of the five mouse strains showed significant CVs at 24 h postprocedure characterized by decreased vessel diameter of the middle cerebral artery close to the Circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the vessel wall displayed significant corrugation and thickening, consistent with CVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A novel mouse model to induce SAH is described and tested in several mouse strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four of the five strains used in this study developed CVs after the induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The procedure is brief, straightforward, reproducible with low mortality, and applicable to commonly used background strains for genetically engineered mice </plain></SENT>
