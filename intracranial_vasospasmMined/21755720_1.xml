<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> hospitalized for psychiatric treatment for the first time, and 50 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> study subjects were in the 30-50 age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> group, determination of vanllylmandelic acid (VMA), an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> metabolite, in 24-h urine and transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography of the circle of Willis vasculature were performed on the first day of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same diagnostic procedures were repeated upon the completion of 21-day medicamentous psychiatric treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial analysis revealed concurrently elevated 24-h VMA in 29 (58.00%) patients and increased values of the mean blood flow velocity (MBFV) in the circle of Willis vasculature in 34 (68.00%) patients, indicating a high correlation of the respective parameters (p = 0.3290) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second analysis performed after 21-day psychiatric treatment showed concurrently elevated 24-h VMA in eight (16.00%) patients and increased MBFV in the circle of Willis vasculature in nine (18.00%) patients, also pointing to a high correlation of the parameters observed (p = 0.7906) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, only two (4.00%) subjects had elevated MBFV in the circle of Willis vessels, whereas the level of 24-h VMA was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Study results pointed to a significant association between elevated levels of stress hormones and increased MBFV in the circle of Willis vasculature caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medicamentous psychiatric treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> administered for three weeks significantly reduced the proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> patients with elevated levels of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> metabolite and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Study results showed a high correlation between diurnal VMA level and elevated MBFV in the circle of Willis vessels, clearly demonstrating the effect of prolonged elevation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels on cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
