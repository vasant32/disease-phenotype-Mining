<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we examined the role of Ras protein, an upstream regulator of MAPK, and the effects of the inhibitors of Ras farnesyltransferase (FTase), FTI-277 and FTase inhibitor I, on angiographic vasospasm and clinical evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five dogs were randomly divided into 5 groups: control, SAH, SAH+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>, SAH+FTI-277, and SAH+FTase inhibitor I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An established canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH was used by injecting autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna on days 0 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed at days 0 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical behavior and the activation of Ras (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-Ras) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 of MAPK in the basilar arteries were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe vasospasm was obtained in the SAH and SAH+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> dogs (42.5+/-2.5% and 38.9+/-2.4%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enhanced <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-Ras and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were observed in the spastic basilar arteries (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of Ras FTase decreased <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-Ras and phosphorylated ERK1/2, attenuated angiographic vasospasm, and improved appetite and activity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ras contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and inhibitors of Ras FTase may have potential in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
