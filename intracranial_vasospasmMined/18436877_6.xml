<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, R-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (VDCC) expression has been associated with increased cerebral artery constriction in a rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to examine whether the blood component <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (oxyHb) can mimic the ability of SAH to cause R-type VDCC expression in the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbit cerebral arteries were organ cultured in serum-free media for up to 5 days in the presence or absence of purified oxyHb (10 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diameter changes in response to diltiazem, (L-type VDCC <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) and SNX-482 (R-type VDCC <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) were recorded at day 1, 3, or 5 in arteries constricted by elevated extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was performed on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from arteries cultured for 5 days (+/-oxyHb) to assess VDCC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 5 days, oxyHb-treated arteries were less sensitive and partially resistant to diltiazem compared to similar arteries organ cultured in the absence of oxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, SNX-482 dilated arteries organ cultured for 5 days in the presence, but not in the absence, of oxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR revealed that oxyHb treated arteries expressed R-type VDCCs (Ca(V) 2.3) in addition to L-type VDCCs (Ca(V) 1.2), whereas untreated arteries expressed only Ca(V) 1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> exposure for 5 days induces the expression of Ca(V) 2.3 in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> contributes to enhanced cerebral artery constriction after SAH via the emergence of R-type VDCCs </plain></SENT>
