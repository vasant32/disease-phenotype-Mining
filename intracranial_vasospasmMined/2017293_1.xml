<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, an intracisternal injection of autologous blood and topical application around the internal carotid artery was performed in the dog model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty dogs were divided into five groups and a cerebral angiography was performed on D0, D2, D5, D7 and D9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the control group (group 1), the angiography in group 2 (12 dogs) systematically exhibited severe V.S.P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 3 (intracisternal injection of venous blood: 5 dogs), the angiography exhibited no vasospasm at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 4, a left frontoparietal flap was opened, allowing us to deposit blood around the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these cases, a severe narrowing of cortical arteries was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group 5 (intracisternal injection of heparinated blood), no vasospasm was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the vasospasm involves the circle of Willis' as well as the cortical arteries </plain></SENT>
