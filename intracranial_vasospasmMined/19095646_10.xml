<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A downstream target of the RhoA/Rho-kinase and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO)/cGMP/cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-dependent kinase (cGKI) pathways, myosin light chain phosphatase activity reflects the sum of both calcium sensitization and desensitization pathways through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As cerebral blood flow is highly spatio-temporally modulated under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiologic conditions, severe perturbations in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral blood flow, such as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, can induce neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nonpermeabilized cerebral vessels stimulated with U-46619, a stable mimetic of endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> implicated in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we observed significant increases in contractile force, RhoA activation, regulatory light chain phosphorylation, as well as phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696, Thr-853, and surprisingly Ser-695 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> signaling completely abrogated basal MYPT1 Ser-695 phosphorylation and significantly increased and potentiated U-46619-induced MYPT1 Thr-853 phosphorylation and contractile force, indicating that NO/cGMP/cGKI signaling maintains basal vascular tone through active inhibition of calcium sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a fall in Ser-695 phosphorylation did not result in an increase in phosphorylation of the Thr-696 site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although activation of cGKI with exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotides</z:chebi> inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi>-induced MYPT1 membrane association, RhoA activation, contractile force, and regulatory light chain phosphorylation, the anticipated decreases in MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696/Thr-853 were not observed, indicating that the vasorelaxant effects of cGKI are not through dephosphorylation of MYPT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> signaling within the intact cerebral vasculature induces "buffered" vasoconstrictions, in which both the RhoA/Rho-kinase calcium-sensitizing and the NO/cGMP/cGKI calcium-desensitizing pathways are activated </plain></SENT>
