<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age was also not correlated to outcome in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the correlation to outcome both Hunt and Hess and the Fisher grading scale had a limited predictive value of outcome due to a low specificity and/or sensitivity </plain></SENT>
