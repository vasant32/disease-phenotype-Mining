<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the improvement of acupuncture in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after embolization of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty cases were randomly divided into two groups, an acupuncture-medication group and a conventional treatment group, 30 cases in each one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases of CVS in conventional treatment group were treated with Nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In acupuncture-medication group, on the basis of the treatment as conventional treatment group, Baihui (GV 20) and Fengchi (GB 20) were selected as the main acupoints in the treatment of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment lasted for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hunt-Hess scale for the standard assessment was adopted to determine the severity of disease before and after treatment and compare the efficacy between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transcranial Doppler (TCD) was conducted on the 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 14th and 21st days successively after operation, and the average flow velocity of 3 pairs of vessels (ACA, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT perfusion (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) was taken to test cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) on the 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st days successively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The improvement of Hunt-Hess scale in acupuncture-medication group was superior to that in conventional treatment group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was adopted in the comparison of ACA, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, CBF, CBV and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the therapy in either group achieved the effect on CVS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But, the improvements in the above mentioned indices in acupuncture-medication group were superior to those in conventional treatment group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at Baihui (GV 20) and Fengchi (GB 20) down-regulates the peak values or upregulates the valley values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It releases the peak of CVS effectively, improves the clinical prognosis significantly and is the effective therapy for CVS after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
