<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) is important in modulating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of PARP in vasospasm using 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), a PARP inhibitor, in a rabbit model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits were divided into 4 groups: (1) no treatment (control group, n=6); (2) blood injection without pretreatment (SAH-only group, n=6); (3) blood injection with pretreatment by vehicle (SAH+vehicle group, n=6); and (4) blood injection with pretreatment by 3-AB (SAH+3-AB group, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH, injecting autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed before (baseline) and after (day 2) SAH, and the diameter of the basilar artery (BA) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were euthanatized after the second angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After perfusion and fixation, the brains were cut into sections for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and immunohistochemical staining for poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26565">ribosyl</z:chebi>)ation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group, there were no differences in the BA lumen caliber between baseline and day 2 (96.8+/-10.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the SAH+3-AB group (88.2+/-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2%) was remarkably attenuated in comparison with that in the SAH-only group (64.9+/-8.0%) and the SAH+vehicle group (65.6+/-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The BA in the SAH+3-AB group showed less corrugation of the tunica elastica interna than that in the SAH-only and SAH+vehicle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Staining for poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26565">ribosyl</z:chebi>)ation was markedly inhibited in smooth muscle and adventitial cells of the BA in the SAH+3-AB group compared with other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibiting <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-ribosylation attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in rabbits, and PARP activation may play an important role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
