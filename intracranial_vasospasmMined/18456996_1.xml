<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a growing body of information concerning their putative role in vasospasm; however, there is a dearth of information concerning the chemical and biochemical characteristics of BOXes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clearer understanding of the synthesis, stability and characteristics of BOXes will be important for a better understanding of the role of BOXes post <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> to oxidize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and produce BOXes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BOXes were extracted and analyzed using conventional methods such as HPLC and mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the stability of BOXes demonstrates that light can photodegrade BOXes with a t1/2 of up to 10h depending upon conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mixed isomers of BOXes have an apparent extinction coefficient of epsilon = 6985, and a lambda(max) of 310 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BOXes are produced by the oxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, yielding a mixture of isomers: 4-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-5-oxo-3-vinyl-(1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ylidene)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27856">acetamide</z:chebi> (BOX A) and 3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-5-oxo-4-vinyl-(1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51150">ylide</z:chebi>-ne)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27856">acetamide</z:chebi> (BOX B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BOXes are photodegraded by ambient light and can be analyzed spectrophotometrically with their extinction coefficient as well as with HPLC or mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their small molecular weight and photodegradation may have made them difficult to characterize in previous studies </plain></SENT>
