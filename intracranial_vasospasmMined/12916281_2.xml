<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred thirty-two cases of acoustic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> operated by the same surgeons between January 1991 and December 2000 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six cases of vascular complications were identified: one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> secondary to persistence of subarachnoid blood after injury to Dandy's vein; three cases of arterial infarction giving rise to a partial anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) syndrome with an unusual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> in two cases (ipsilateral in one patient and strong controlateral in one patient presenting preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0008568'>vestibular areflexia</z:hpo>); one case of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> of the cerebello-pontine angle (CPA) causing strong ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>; and one case of venous infarction of the cerebellar vermis secondary to accidental sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular complications after <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>acoustic neuroma</z:hpo> surgery are potentially devastating and should be identified as early as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid extubation is recommended for systematic neurologic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among abnormal signs and symptoms that should alert the surgeon, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the operated side or contralateral in patient presenting preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0008568'>vestibular areflexia</z:hpo> appears to be of great value </plain></SENT>
