<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because there is presently no information regarding gene transfer to human cerebral arteries, the principal objective of this study was to characterize adenovirus-mediated expression and function of recombinant endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) gene in human pial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pial arteries (outer diameter 500 to 1,000 microm) were isolated from 30 patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and were studied using histologic staining, histochemistry, electron microscopy, and isometric force recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene transfer experiments were performed ex vivo using adenoviral vectors encoding genes for bovine eNOS (AdCMVeNOS) and Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (AdCMVLacZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In transduced arteries, studied 24 hours after exposure to vectors, expression of recombinant beta-galactosidase and eNOS was detected by histochemistry, localizing mainly to the adventitia (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectron microscopy localized recombinant eNOS in adventitial fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During contractions to U46619, bradykinin-induced relaxations were significantly augmented in AdCMVeNOS-transduced rings compared with control and AdCMVLacZ-transduced rings (P &lt; 0.01; n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NOS inhibitor L-nitroarginine methylester (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>) caused significantly greater contraction in AdCMVeNOS-transduced rings (P &lt; 0.001; n = 4) and inhibited bradykinin-induced relaxations in control and transduced rings (P &lt; 0.001; n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The current findings suggest that in AdCMVeNOS-transduced human pial arteries, expression of recombinant eNOS occurs mainly in adventitial fibroblasts where it augments relaxations to NO-dependent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> such as bradykinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings from the current study might be beneficial in future clinical applications of gene therapy for the treatment or prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
