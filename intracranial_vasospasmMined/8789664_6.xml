<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), which is an intrinsic PKC activator, significantly increased from days 4 to 7 in the basilar artery after the initial SAH, and the continuous administration of 1,2-bis(nicotinamido)-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="32879">propane</z:chebi> (AVS), a novel free radical scavenger, not only lowered the concentration of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> in the CSF but also successfully suppressed the basilar arterial wall in the same model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> generated in the subarachnoid clot affect the DAG content of the cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETEs</z:chebi>) with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed the production of relatively large amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> in the subarachnoid clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine the potential effect of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> on the DAG content of the cerebral artery, the basilar artery was incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> induced a concentration-dependent slow increase in DAG content in the arterial wall after 6 hours of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under conditions in which DAG formation was facilitated by the Ca(++)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>, DAG accumulation in the basilar artery was enhanced in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> generated in the subarachnoid clot, induced DAG accumulation in the arterial wall by inhibition of DAG metabolism, resulting in the induction of prolonged PKC-dependent smooth muscle contraction in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
