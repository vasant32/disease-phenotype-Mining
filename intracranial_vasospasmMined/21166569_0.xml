<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: As many as 33% of patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) present with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (MIAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery has the potential to increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> due to surgical manipulations of the parent vessels and brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, 1-stage surgery of MIAs, which usually takes longer and requires more manipulation, could even further increase the risk of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to define the correlation between vasospasm and the operative treatment of single <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> versus MIAs in a 1-stage operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors analyzed a database including 1016 patients with SAH, identified retrospectively between 1989 and 1996 and prospectively collected between 1997 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were endovascular treatment, surgery after SAH Day 3, and, in patients with MIAs, undergoing more than 1 operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was diagnosed by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography and was defined as a maximum mean blood flow velocity &gt; 120 cm/second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of symptomatic vasospasm was made if a new neurological deficit occurred that could not be explained by concomitant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 643 patients who experienced 810 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four hundred twenty-four patients were female (65.9%) and 219 were male (34.1%) with an average age of 53.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-one patients (18.8%) were diagnosed with MIAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Maximum mean flow velocities measured by TCD were 131 cm/second in patients with MIAs and 129.5 cm/second in patients with single <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of TCD vasospasm (p = 0.561) as well as of symptomatic vasospasm (p = 0.241) was not significantly different in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clipping of more than 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in a 1-stage operation within 72 hours after SAH can be performed without increasing the risk of cerebral (TCD) vasospasm and symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
