<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an association between the potent vasoconstricting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, neuropeptide Y, and delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH has been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was based on the findings of increased neuropeptide Y levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma after SAH in animals and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this study, the primate model of SAH was used to assess the possible role of neuropeptide Y in delayed vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cynomolgus monkeys underwent placement of a clot of either whole blood or red blood cells in the subarachnoid space around the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequential arteriography for assessment of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> diameter and sampling of blood and CSF for neuropeptide Y were performed: before SAH (Day 0); 7 days after SAH, when signs of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> peak in this model and in humans; 12 days after SAH; and 28 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> did not evoke changes in CSF or plasma levels of neuropeptide Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine monkeys had arteriographic evidence of vasospasm on Day 7, but no change in neuropeptide Y levels occurred in plasma or CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, neuropeptide Y levels did not change, even after resolution of vasospasm on Day 12 or Day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuropeptide Y levels were substantially higher in CSF than in arterial plasma (p less than 0.003 at each interval) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between neuropeptide Y levels in CSF and in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results do not confirm a relationship between neuropeptide Y levels in the CSF or peripheral plasma and delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in SAH </plain></SENT>
