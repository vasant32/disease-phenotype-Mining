<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has not been fully established, several lines of evidence suggest that the vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin (ET) may play a crucial role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the potential of TBC 11251 (TBC), a newly developed ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, to prevent and/or reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was examined in a well-established rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five New Zealand White rabbits were assigned to one of six groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH was induced in rabbits comprising five of the groups by injecting autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were as follows: 1) control (no SAH); 2) SAH only; 3) SAH + placebo at 24 and 36 hours (24/36); 4) SAH + TBC (24/36); 5) SAH + placebo twice daily (BID); and 6) SAH + TBC BID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> drug-treated animals received an intravenous dosage of 5 mg/kg TBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours, the animals were killed by intracardiac perfusion with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brainstems were removed and the basilar arteries (BAs) were prepared for histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of each BA was measured using computer-assisted videomicroscopy by an investigator blind to the group from which it came </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A one-way analysis of variance and paired group mean comparisons with the post-hoc Fisher least significant difference test were used for analysis of BA diameters and physiological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The model provided reliable vasospasm, with the mean BA cross-sectional area constricting from 0.388 mm2 in the control group to 0.106 mm2 (27.4% of control) in the SAH only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with TBC (24/36) after SAH (reversal protocol) produced a mean BA area of 0.175 mm2 (44.2% of control) which, although larger than the placebo group value of 0.135 mm2 (39.9% of control), was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with TBC BID (prevention protocol) produced a mean BA area of 0.303 mm2 (78.1% of control) compared with the placebo BID value of 0.134 mm2 (34.6% of control); this effect was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no side effects noted and no differences in the mean arterial pressures between drug and placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that systemic administration of the ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> TBC significantly attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH when given as a preventative therapy, and they provide additional support for the role of ET in the establishment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
