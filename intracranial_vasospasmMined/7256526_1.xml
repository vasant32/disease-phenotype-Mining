<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different responses occurred when the vessels were taken from patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> and from patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> group, significantly stronger contractions were demonstrated upon exposure to <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and 5-hydroxytryptamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because these agents increase the movement of extracellular calcium into smooth muscle cells in the excitation-contraction coupling process, it is suggested that, in vessels from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients, there is enhanced influx of calcium across the cell membrane and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is thus not due to extravascular actions alone </plain></SENT>
