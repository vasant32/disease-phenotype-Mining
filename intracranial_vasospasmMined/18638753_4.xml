<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They number seven: relaxation of spastic arteries or prevention of spasm; opening up of collateral channels; neuronal protection at the membrane level; intracellular actions in neurones or vascular cells; alterations of blood rheology; antimitogenic effects; and improved fluid management of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of more minor actions may also be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is likely that more than one mechanism is involved in their protective effect, especially at different periods in the time course of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
