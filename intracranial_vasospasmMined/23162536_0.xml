<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular relaxation and vasodilation is mediated via activation of the CGRP receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This atypical receptor is made up of a G protein-coupled receptor called calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), a single transmembrane protein called receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP), and an additional protein that is required for Ga(s) coupling, known as receptor component protein (RCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms involved in CGRP-mediated relaxation have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO)-dependent endothelium-dependent mechanisms or cAMP-mediated endothelium-independent pathways; the latter being more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is associated with cerebral vasoconstriction that occurs several days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and is often fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vasospasm occurs in 30-40% of patients and is the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstriction is associated with a decrease in CGRP levels in nerves and an increase in CGRP levels in draining blood, suggesting that CGRP is released from nerves to oppose the vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This evidence has led to the concept that exogenous CGRP may be beneficial in a condition that has proven hard to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present article reviews: (a) the pathophysiology of delayed ischemic neurologic deficit after SAH (b) the basics of the CGRP receptor structure, signal transduction, and vasodilatation mechanisms and (c) the studies that have been conducted so far using CGRP in both animals and humans with SAH </plain></SENT>
