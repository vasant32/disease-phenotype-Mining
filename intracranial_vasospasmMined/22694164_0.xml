<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes and vasoconstriction are two complications that occur soon after SAH experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the changes in rCBF and vertebro-basilar arterial diameter in a cisterna megna SAH model in Sprague-Dawley rats and intended to explore whether improving early rCBF reduction and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> could contribute to alleviating blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats for rCBF, vasospasm and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability assessments, nimodipine (NDP) or saline was administered intravenously 5 minutes after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rCBF within the first 60 minutes after SAH was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability indexed by Evans Blue extravasation was assessed 4 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography for the caliber changes of the vertebro-basilar artery were conducted 30 minutes post SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pronounced rCBF reduction and vasospasm were observed soon after SAH, followed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability increment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NDP administration could improve rCBF and attenuate vasospasm, followed by the alleviation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that early improvement of cerebral circulation by NDP may contribute to the reduction in brain injury indexed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption </plain></SENT>
