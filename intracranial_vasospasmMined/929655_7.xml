<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">prostaglandin F2alpha</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi>) was measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and compared to control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of this <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> was elevated at some time in most patients during the course of their illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this could not be correlated with the severity of neurological deficits observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility that the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> in lumbar fluid may not reflect that present intracranially was tested experimentally in anesthetized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these experiments only a small fraction of the radioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> injected into the cisterna magna appeared in lumbar CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">Prostaglandin F2alpha</z:chebi> rapidly disappeared from the cisterna magna, half time 8 minutes, and radioactivity was present in blood from the jugular vein indicating that normally this <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> rapidly egresses from the CSF into blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> can be rapidly transported away from the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This could explain the low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> in CSF of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and in some patients who have severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> in lumbar CSF noted in some patients might be due, in part, to an impairment of transport caused by the size and location of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
