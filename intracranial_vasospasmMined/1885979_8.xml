<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Laser energy at a wavelength of 480 nm was applied in 1-microseconds pulses of 3 to 10 mJ to two models of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbit common carotid arteries (CCA's) were constricted chronically by the application of human blood within a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peak vasospasm developed 24 to 48 hours later, and persisted for up to 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endovascular laser treatment was delivered to 40 CCA's via a 200-microns diameter <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="115" ids="46727">quartz</z:chebi> fiber introduced through the femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CCA caliber increased from 60% of the pre-vasospasm control diameter to a minimum post-laser diameter of 83% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No instances of laser-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> were observed for up to 60 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic laser application to nine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessels was able to attenuate the development of vasospasm if blood was applied immediately thereafter (88% vs. 59% of control diameter, p less than 0.02), but not if blood was applied 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies in 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CCA's established that there was a considerable margin between the laser energy required to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and that which caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, providing that the fiber remained relatively central within the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphological examination demonstrated focal loss of endothelial cells immediately after laser application, followed approximately 7 days later by the development of areas of intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only minimal changes were observed in the medial or adventitial layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a second study, the basilar artery of seven dogs was constricted chronically by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood 3 days apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five dogs received endovascular laser treatment 7 or 10 days after the first injection, when basilar artery diameter was reduced to a mean of 61% and 77% of control, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immediately following treatment, basilar artery diameter increased to 104% and 102% of resting diameter, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both untreated and laser-treated arteries were smaller than the control diameter at 30 days (80% and 82%, respectively), but in each group the vasodilatory response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that 1-microsecond laser pulses are well tolerated by systemic and cerebral arteries in two different animal models, and suggest that the 480-nm pulsed-dye laser may have an application for the treatment or prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
