<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway and endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) in the cerebral vasculature in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-mediated attenuation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, an irreversible pharmacological PI3K inhibitor, and a rat SAH endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> was administered intraperitoneally in two dosages (1 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) at 0.5, 24, and 48 hr after SAH and histological parameters of ipsilateral intracranial carotid artery (ICA) were assessed at 24 and 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH significantly decreased ICA diameter and perimeter while increasing wall thickness at both 24 and 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-dosage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> prevented the reduction of ICA diameter and perimeter following SAH, whereas both high and low dosages reduced wall thickness significantly at 24 and 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> were significantly reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-dosage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> increased pAkt and peNOS (phosphorylated forms) levels without increasing Akt and eNOS expression compared with the SAH group and also improved neurological deficits at 24 and 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> did not affect protein levels by itself compared with untreated sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study elucidates the critical role of the PI3K activation leading to phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-mediated attenuation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
