<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the actions of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> on cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity, cardiovascular variables, and arterial gas tensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> was infused into awake, adult sheep at rates of 3 and 6 mmol/min to a total of 15 and 30 mmol, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct arterial pressure, cardiac output, and CBF velocity were measured using chronically implanted catheters and a sagittal sinus Doppler flow probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood was sampled for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentrations and blood gas analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infusion of both 15 and 30 mmol of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> increased CBF velocity by 14% (P = .056) and 24% (P = .023), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These increases were accompanied by increases in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) of 12% (P = .033) and 17% (P = .048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that both PaCO2 (P = .00037) and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (P = .0012) were important predictors of CBF velocity </plain></SENT>
