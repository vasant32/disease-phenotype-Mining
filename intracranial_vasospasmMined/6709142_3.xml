<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelets harvested from 4 ml of blood were added to autologous blood in an attempt to accentuate any effect that vasoactive substances such as <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, contained in platelets, might have on producing cerebral VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antiserotonin medications were administered in an attempt to reduce the frequency or severity of angiographically proven VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into small (1 ml/kg) and large (1.2 to 1.5 ml/kg) <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> groups and later were randomized equally to receive either saline placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi> (0.013 mg/kg i.m.) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6104">kanamycin</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg p.o.) administered 3 hours after SAH and daily thereafter to Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both the small and the large <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> groups of treated animals, there was a significant reduction in <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) compared to base line levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the groups of nontreated monkeys with small and large <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels were not statistically different from control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite reduction of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels to 19 and 26% of the control values in the small and large <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, treated groups, there was no apparent difference in the frequency or severity of angiographically proven VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study found no evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6104">kanamycin</z:chebi> have a beneficial effect on preventing VSP when treatment is begun after SAH </plain></SENT>
