<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=164) were allocated randomly to SAH+<z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>, SAH+vehicle (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi>), or sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SAH model was induced through perforating internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg) or the vehicle was injected via vena caudalis 60 min before the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality, neurological scores, water content of brain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were recorded at 24 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of cerebral cortex was determined by TUNEL staining; caspase-3, bax and bcl-2 by Western blotting; P53 expression by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> administrated in advance improved neurological scores, ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive cells were reduced significantly in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P53 was not found significantly different between <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>-treated and vehicle-treated group, while P53 positive cells were markedly higher in SAH group than that in sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cleaved caspase-3 protein was decreased significantly in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>-treated group, while bax, bcl-2 protein expression did not differ statistically among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> ameliorated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and early brain injury after experimental SAH in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms may be partly related to inhibition of caspase-3 dependent proapoptosis pathway </plain></SENT>
