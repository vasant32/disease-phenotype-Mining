<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Attempts to reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) rely on a limited number of treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">Calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> have proven a benefit but their vasodilating effect on spastic cerebral arteries is relatively modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50218">phosphodiesterase inhibitor</z:chebi>, combines vasodilating and inotropic properties, but limited data exist to support its use for the treatment of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the efficacy and tolerance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> in patients with CVS secondary to aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients with angiographically-proven CVS (arterial diameter reduction &gt;40%) have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> was infused in the cerebral territory(ies) involved and followed by continuous intravenous infusion until Day 14 after initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated angiographic reversal of CVS, hemodynamic tolerance, and neurological outcome 1 year after aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four selective intraarterial infusions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> were required to treat 72 vasospastic territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> resulted in 53+/-37% increase in arterial diameter (P&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> infusion resulted in moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp>, but systemic arterial pressure remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients (23%) had angiographically-proven vasospasm recurrence within 48 hours after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of them were successfully reversed after another intraarterial infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 underwent mechanical angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients (9%) died in ICU, and 2 were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients had very good neurological outcome (modified Rankin scale: 0.8+/-1.0; Barthel index: 100 [95-100]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> is effective and safe for reversal of CVS after aSAH and should be tested in a large randomized trial </plain></SENT>
