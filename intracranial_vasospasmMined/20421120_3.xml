<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the proof of delayed ischemic brain damage is missing so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was, therefore, to determine histological changes in correlation with the development of symptomatic and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) proven CVS in this animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CVS was induced by injection of autologous blood in the cisterna magna of 22 Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological changes were analyzed on day 3 and day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed by PWI at 3 tesla magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cell count did not differ between sham operated and SAH rats in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, on day 5 after SAH the neuronal cell count was significantly reduced in the hippocampus (p&lt;0.001) and the inner cortical layer (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present investigation provides quantitative data on brain tissue damage in association with delayed CVS for the first time in a rat SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, our data suggest that the rat double-SAH model may be suitable to mimic delayed ischemic brain damage due to CVS and to investigate the neuroprotective effects of drugs </plain></SENT>
