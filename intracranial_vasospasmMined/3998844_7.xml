<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The model mimics the human experience including the production of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six monkeys were pretreated with diltiazem (25 mg/kg twice daily) for 2 days prior to surgical production of an SAH and for 5 days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This group was compared with six untreated monkeys that also sustained an SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of cerebral arteries measured at six angiographic sites was 60.6% of the pre-SAH diameter for the untreated group and 99.7% for the diltiazem-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These values are significantly different (p less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no neurological deficit in the pretreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of the "most constricted vessel" in each experiment was 22% of the prehemorrhage diameter for the untreated and 84% for the treated group (p less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial pressure was unaffected by the dosage regimen </plain></SENT>
