<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim of the study was to quantify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) by morphometric examination of basilar artery and to evaluate the influence of endothelin receptor blocker BQ-123 on basilar artery constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rat cisterna magna (CM) was cannulated and after 7 days SAH was developed by administration of 100 microl autologic, non-heparinized blood to the CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sham <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was developed by intracisternal administration of 100 microl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelin receptor blocker BQ-123 was injected into the CM in a dose of 40 nmol diluted in 50 microl of cerebrospinal fluid 20 min. before SAH, and 24h and 48 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After perfusion fixation the brains were removed from the skull and histological preparations of basilar artery were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The internal diameter and wall thickness of basilar arteries was measured by interactive morphometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most severe vasospasm was found in rats after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of numerous infiltrations composed of neutrophils and macrophages correlated with advanced vasospasm (index of constriction 5 times lower than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), suggesting the role of other factors participating in the late phase of vasospasms after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of BQ-123 in the late phase after SAH caused the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following the administration of BQ-123 in the late phase (48 h after SAH) the basilar artery dilated, its wall became thinner, and the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltrations</z:mp> in the subarachnoid space decreased compared to the values after SAH alone </plain></SENT>
