<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The effect of endovascular treatment for vasospasm was investigated by analysing the results of patients treated in Wakayama City in 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety nine patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>, who survived more than one week and were treated in Wakayama City in 1994, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty five patients caused symptomatic vasospasm and 25 were treated by endovascular therapy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) and/or intra-arterial papaverine infusion (IAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed for proximal vasospasm which located in the main arterial trunk, such as ICA, M1, BA (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IAP was chosen for distal vasospasm which located mainly in the M2, A1, A2 (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and/or IAP was performed for diffuse vasospasm which located in proximal and distal arteries (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the proximal vasospasm group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were good to moderately disabled on the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the distal vasospasm group, 8 patients were good to moderately disabled, and 4 patients were severely disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall results were as follows: 17 (68%), good to moderately disabled, 4 (16%), severely disabled, 4 (16%), dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The morbidity and mortality rate was 8/25 (32%) in symptomatic spasm group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was very effective especially for proximal vasospasm, but IAP was not always effective for distal or diffuse vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diffuse vasospasm revealed a high mortality rate in spite of the endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
