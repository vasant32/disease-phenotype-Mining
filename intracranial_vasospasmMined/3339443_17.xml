<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vasospasm is maximum at 10 minutes and the maximum late vasospasm occurs 2 days after the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brattleboro rats, which are deficient in arginine vasopressin (AVP), do not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vasospasm after SAH but exhibit a degree of late vasospasm that is not significantly different from that seen in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cisternal injection of AVP induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vasospasm in Sprague-Dawley rats with a duration similar to that seen after cisternal blood injection; however, at 2 days, the vessel diameter was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous AVP <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> or intracisternal AVP antiserum administered prior to the SAH prevented the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vasospasm without affecting the late phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that an increased release of AVP in the cerebrospinal fluid is involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
