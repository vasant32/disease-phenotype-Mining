<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports have recently emphasized that oxyHb from erythrocytes might be responsible for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the hem-oxygenase which converts oxyHb to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was analyzed and the increase of hem-oxygenase in the CSF after SAH was reconfirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 23 cases of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, combined ventriculo-cisternal drainage and cisternal drainage designed by us was performed after clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in early stage after rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through a Y-shaped tube the CSF accumulated in the cistern and was drained extracranially through cisternal drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, 2 (9%) of the 23 patients treated with the drainage showed symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 13 (33%) of 39 patients without the drainage showed symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be concluded that the drainage may contribute to prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
