<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most effective were fluids/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and nimodipine, which reduced the incidence of DID by over half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other drugs that may be useful are tissue plasminogen activator and the aminosteroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of others have also been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the treatment of DID, calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, and fluid loading and hypertensive treatment are the most effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transluminal angioplasty is also proving to be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of prophylaxis and treatment with fluids and nimodipine should reduce poor outcome resulting from vasospasm by two-thirds, from 21% untreated to less than 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of the more or less proven efficacy of these measures, large numbers of cases are still being reported in whom no specific management is being used </plain></SENT>
