<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a literature review more than 30 000 cases were found where vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of angiographic vasospasm was 43.3% overall, and 67.3% where angiography was done at a time of maximum expected spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm or delayed ischaemic deficit (DID) occurred in 32.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in incidence and time course between preoperative and postoperative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>30% of those with DID died, and permanent neurological deficits occurred in 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A fatal outcome was much more likely in the presence of vasospasm, and a satisfactory outcome one third less likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm is thus the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in about 10%, and of disability in slightly more cases of aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extent of the problem has not changed significantly over three decades </plain></SENT>
