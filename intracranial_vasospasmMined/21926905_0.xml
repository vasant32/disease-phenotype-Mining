<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) causes a high mortality rate and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that oxidant stress plays an important role in neuronal injury after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and neurologic injury in a SAH model in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model was used to induce SAH in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Groups of animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> group, n = 24) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (vehicle group, n = 33), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (SAH group, n = 34) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (sham group, n = 22), 3 h after SAH induction and daily for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> was measured before SAH induction and once daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> transporter-1, wall thickness and the perimeter of the basilar artery, neurologic scores, <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp>, malondialdehyde, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, and catalase activities were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels were lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> group versus the SAH and vehicle groups, especially on day 1 (56 folds attenuation vs. vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter-1 was preserved after SAH in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampus and the cortex, malondialdehyde was attenuated (30% and 50%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (35% and 64%) and catalase (34% and 38%) activities were increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> rats compared with the SAH rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate (relative risk: 0.59), wall thickness (30%) and perimeter (31%) of the basilar artery, <z:mp ids='MP_0003224'>neuron degeneration</z:mp> scores (39%), and neurologic scores (31%) were improved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> in multiple doses is effective against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> neurotoxicity and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and improves the mortality rate in rats with SAH </plain></SENT>
