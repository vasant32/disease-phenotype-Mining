<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to explore whether oxyHb affects the release of endothelin-1 and the induction of endothelin-1 messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and to examine the mechanism whereby oxyHb induces endothelin-1 production in cultured vascular smooth-muscle cells as well as in cultured endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> produces concentration-dependent (0.1 to 10 microM) and time-dependent (0 to 24 hours) increases in immunoreactive endothelin-1 in conditioned medium from bovine arterial endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> induces immunoreactive endothelin-1 in rat aortic smooth-muscle cells in the same fashion, although the rate is 30-fold less than that of endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This promoting effect is much higher than that of other stimulators such as thrombin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from endothelial cells also showed endothelin-1 mRNA induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">Staurosporine</z:chebi>, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, inhibited oxyHb-induced endothelin-1 production in both vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells, whereas an increase of intracellular cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> or an addition of 8-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-cAMP only inhibited this effect in smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that oxyHb-induced endothelin-1 production in endothelial cells is regulated by PKC, and in smooth-muscle cells by both PKC and the cAMP-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The production of endothelin, the most potent vasoconstrictor, in both vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells by oxyHb may have significance in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
