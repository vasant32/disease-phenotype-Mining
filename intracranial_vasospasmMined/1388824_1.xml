<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels found in samples obtained in patients following SAH are compared with those found in controls and also correlated with clinical grade on admission as assessed by the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score and the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons' grading system, and with the amount of subarachnoid blood seen on CT, the occurrence of ischaemic deterioration, the occurrence of low-density change on CT, the presence of vasospasm on angiography, clinical outcome as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Score 3 months following the ictus, and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability as assessed 3 months following the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of FPA found in blood and CSF from patients following SAH were significantly raised when compared with those found in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant correlation between blood FPA levels and the amount of subarachnoid blood seen on initial CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF FPA levels had a statistically significant correlation with outcome as assessed at 3 months post-ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant correlation was found between blood or CSF FPA levels and any of the other variables studied </plain></SENT>
