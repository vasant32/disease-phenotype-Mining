<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CV) is a potentially disastrous consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> despite medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine is a potent drug for vessel relaxation, but side effects may preclude a sufficient dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore whether continuous local intra-arterial nimodipine administration (CLINA) can reverse vasospasm and prevent delayed ischemic neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients (5 women; mean age, 47.2 years) with severe CV despite maximum medical therapy underwent CLINA within 2 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After anticoagulation, microcatheters were inserted distally in the concerning supra-aortic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">Glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate injection (2 mg) was followed by CLINA (nimodipine 0.4 mg/h for 70-147 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of CLINA was determined by neurological status, transcranial Doppler sonography, and partial tissue oxygen pressure values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, neurological deficits improved or partial tissue oxygen pressure values returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and transcranial Doppler sonography confirmed a reduced blood flow velocity within 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed no ischemic lesion caused by CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome was good (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) in 3 patients, whereas 1 patient had a moderate clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 3-4) and 2 patients had a poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 5) because of the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preliminary data show that CLINA is a straightforward, effective, and safe option for patients with severe CV refractory to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dilation of spastic arteries starts within a few hours and is lasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Indication for CLINA is peripheral and diffuse CV at any location </plain></SENT>
