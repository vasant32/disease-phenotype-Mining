<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of transcranial Doppler in follow-up and determining the need for repeat intervention has not been previously emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF REPORT: Intracranial angioplasty for clinically evident vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was performed in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients, transcranial Doppler flow velocities remained elevated despite initial anatomic correction of the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reangiography revealed new areas of involvement by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reangioplasty or papaverine infusion treatment of the new lesions resulted in decreased flow velocities and clinical improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler has a more significant role than has been previously emphasized in the management of patients undergoing interventional neuroradiological treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the persistence of elevated transcranial Doppler flow velocities after intracranial angioplasty suggests the need for repeat angiographic evaluation and possibly further therapy </plain></SENT>
