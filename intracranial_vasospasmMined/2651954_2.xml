<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of extensive research, the pathogenesis of vasospasm remains obscure, and clinical management has so far been extremely difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the evaluation of the efficacy of any treatment and the timing of operation, the development and resolution of the arterial narrowing should be monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is important to know the correlation between the change in flow velocity and the course of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the blood flow velocity in the different arteries was measured at short intervals (at least every third day) with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, in eighteen patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity changes began to accelerate from 3 days after surgery, and reached the maximum value between 7 and 10 days, with normalization occurring within the following 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes showed a significant relationship to the severity of vasospasm, the side of the operative approach, and the administration of calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we categorized the flow velocity changes of vasospasm for clinical practice as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(1) A slight acceleration of up to 120 cm/s in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and 90 cm/s in ACA was defined as within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this state vasospasm was never observed angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) Flow velocity changes between 120 and 140 cm/s were a subcritical state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These changes were seen in vasospastic patients who did not develop ischemic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(3) Flow velocity changes of over 140 cm/s in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and 100 cm/s in ACA were critical vasospasm, since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients who developed ischemic symptoms were in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Velocity changes higher than 170 cm/s in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and 130 cm/s in ACA seem to indicate a critical condition with a tendency to develop into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The comparison between the time course of the flow velocity changes and clinical status showed that in symptomatic vasospasm the increase in velocity occurred before the manifestation of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The transcranial Doppler measurements help to identify those patients who have a high risk of developing neurological deficits due to vasospasm, and help to select those who would benefit from preventive treatment in asymptomatic stage </plain></SENT>
