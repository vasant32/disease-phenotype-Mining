<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate whether Src tyrosine kinase, an upstream regulator of MAPK, is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An established canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four dogs were divided into four groups: control, vehicle-treated, Src inhibitor PP2-treated, and Src inhibitor damnacanthal-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vehicle (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>), PP2, or damnacanthal was injected daily into the cisterna magna of 18 dogs at 3 to 6 days after induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on Day 0 (the day on which the first blood injection was administered to induce SAH) and on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of Src and MAPK activation in basilar arteries (BAs) collected on Day 7 post-SAH was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe vasospasm was observed in the BAs of vehicle-treated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild vasospasm was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs treated with Src inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated Src and MAPK were increased after SAH and activation of these kinases in the BAs was abolished by PP2 and damnacanthal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The tyrosine kinase Src is an important upstream regulator of MAPK, and inhibition of Src might offer a new therapy in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
