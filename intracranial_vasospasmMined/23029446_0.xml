<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we applied ferrous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> (FC) complexes to the primary cultured mouse cerebral endothelial cell (CEC) to mimic the SAH conditions and to address the issue how SAH-induced NOS2 up-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using immunocytochemical staining technique, we demonstrated that NOS2 was expressed in the cultured CEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the CEC with FC induced increases of the intracellular level of ROS, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) nuclear translocation as well as NFκB binding onto the NOS promoter, and the levels of NOS2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were abolished by pre-treatment of the cell with N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">Acetyl</z:chebi>-Cysteine (NAC), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, two previously predicted NFκB binding sites were confirmed in the NOS2 promoter within the range of -1529 bp to -1516 bp and -1224 bp to -1210 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both NFκB binding sites are involved in the FC-activated NOS2 transcriptional activity; the binding site located at -1529 bp to -1516 bp played a greater role than the other binding site located at -1224 bp to -1210 bp in the mouse CEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the molecular mechanism underlying FC-induced up-regulation of NOS2 in the mouse CEC </plain></SENT>
