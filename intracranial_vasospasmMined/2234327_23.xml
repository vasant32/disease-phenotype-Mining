<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This experiment was performed to determine whether endothelin plays a physiological role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cisternal injection of endothelin (10(-8) mol or 10(-9) mol) caused severe vasoconstriction of the canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasoconstriction was dose related and long lasting, persisting for more than 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This constriction was prevented completely by pretreatment with nicardipine (10(-8) mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelin produced a marked and transient elevation in blood pressure and might play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further investigation will be needed to determine the role of endothelin in the pathogenesis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
