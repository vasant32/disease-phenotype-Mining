<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> on endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the isolated rabbit basilar artery was examined using an isometric tension recording method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) (10(-7) - (10(-4) M) evoked a dose-dependent vasodilation of isolated rabbit basilar artery previously contracted by 10(-6) M <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This vasodilating action disappeared after removal of the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced vasodilation of rabbit basilar artery is thought to be strictly endothelium-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> (10(-7) - 10(-5) M) inhibited this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation conditional upon the dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">Adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP, 10(-7) - 10(-4) M) also relaxed isolated rabbit basilar artery already contracted by 10(-6) M <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This vasodilating action was slightly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT), and markedly attenuated by removal of the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This ATP-induced vasodilation is thought to be composed of ATP itself (endothelium-dependent) and ATP degradation products (endothelium-independent) such as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> markedly inhibited ATP-induced vasodilation, but there still remained a small vasodilation, which was blocked by 8-PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Papaverine-induced vasodilation was not affected by removal of the endothelium, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> did not inhibit the papaverine-induced vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rabbit basilar artery has endothelium-dependent vasodilating mechanisms induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and ATP, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> selectively blocks the endothelium-dependent vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding may relate to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>: there is a possibility that the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> released from lysed erythrocytes inhibits the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries; furthermore, the endothelial degeneration following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> may impair the vasodilating mechanisms of cerebral artery smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
