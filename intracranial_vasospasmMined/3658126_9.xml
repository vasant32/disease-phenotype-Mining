<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mounting evidence suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may be linked to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that follows <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients judged to be at high risk for vasospasm because of either poor admitting grade or a large amount of subarachnoid blood shown by computed tomography were treated with a course of high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, and management results were compared to those of a cohort of contemporary control patients matched for grade, number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, time from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> to admission, time from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> to operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> were twice as likely to have an excellent result and half as likely to die as those who were not treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence and severity of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were reduced in treated patients when compared to control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the treated patients developed a serious side effect that could be attributed to steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the conclusion that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm is an inflammatory vasculopathy and suggest that early treatment with high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> may benefit this high risk group of patients </plain></SENT>
