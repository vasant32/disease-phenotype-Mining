<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of extravasated erythrocytes in vasospasm has never been well analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate this point, the basilar arteries of cats were exposed and subjected to topical application of various blood fractions in their fresh state and after prolonged incubation for 1 to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incubation was done to test stability of the vasoconstrictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe vasospasm was induced by application of fresh and incubated fractions of lysed erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fresh, intact erythrocytes had no vasoactivity, but by incubation they lysed and gained vasoconstrictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm induced by lysed erythrocytes both in their fresh state and after prolonged incubation never relaxed, and tended to increase in severity during observation up to 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fresh serum and platelet-rich plasma had vasoconstrictors, but they were lost after incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apparently platelet-induced vasoconstriction is of short duration and contributes only to the early phase of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Later, 12 to 24 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, iron pigments released by lysis of extravasated erythrocytes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> or methemoglobin) irritate the arterial wall and induce prolonged vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is emphasized that the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> should be focused on the role of the breakdown products of extravasated erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
