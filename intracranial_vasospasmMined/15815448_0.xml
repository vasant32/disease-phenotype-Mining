<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A double blind, placebo controlled, escalating dose study was undertaken in five healthy, conscious volunteers to investigate the effects of human synthetic alpha calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) on middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During placebo infusion, there was no significant change in any of the parameters studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During CGRP infusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects showed flushing of the face and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusion of CGRP caused a significant increase in arterial pulse pressure and heart rate and a fall in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure when compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peak and mean <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in pulsatility index though interpretation of this was confounded by the central systemic effects of CGRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed haemodynamic changes may be explained by a prompt sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system response in order to maintain mean arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that if cerebral vasodilatation had occurred, it was not associated with increased blood flow as an increase in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity might have been expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation is that, at the doses employed, CGRP did not cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral vessels in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This does not however exclude the fact that CGRP may cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of a spastic artery as seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
