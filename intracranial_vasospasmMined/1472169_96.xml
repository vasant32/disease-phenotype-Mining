<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients admitted to the hospital in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> after severe head injury had continuous and simultaneous monitoring of SjvO2, intracranial pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, arterial and jugular venous blood gas levels, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration were measured every 8 hours for 1 to 11 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whenever SjvO2 dropped to less than 50%, a standardized protocol was followed to confirm the validity of the desaturation and to establish its cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation of SjvO2 values obtained by catheter and with direct measurement of O2 saturation by a co-oximeter on venous blood withdrawn through the catheter was excellent after in vivo calibration when there was adequate light intensity at the catheter tip (176 measurements: r = 0.87, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 60 episodes of jugular venous oxygen desaturation occurred in 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients the desaturation value was confirmed by the co-oximeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 33 episodes of desaturation in these 20 patients, due to the following causes: intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 12 episodes, hypocarbia in 10, arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in six, combinations of the above in three, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in one, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of jugular venous oxygen desaturations found in this study suggests that continuous monitoring of SjvO2 may be of clinical value in patients with head injury </plain></SENT>
