<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced by infusion of fresh blood into the basal cistern through a small sraniectomy in the base of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty adult mongrel dogs were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these a complete recording was obtained in 32 cases under the constant controlled ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The samples of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained repeatedly at the inserted 1 to 3 hours from the <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">Polyethylene</z:chebi> tube inserted into the cisterna magna subarachnoid space, carotid artery and internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During these procedures, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> size of the intracranial basal artery was measured angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries in response to experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> had a biphasic course, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (the vasoconstrictive phenomenon which lasts less than 6 hours) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (the revasoconstriction occured and continued more than 24 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The former was named "Released Group" which consists of 16 dogs and the later was named "Prolonged Group" which consists of 20 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both group, pH and bicarbonate ion concentration of CSF were found to be reduced by twenty percent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value on the aveaage about three hours after subarachnoid hemorrage, apparently reflecting occurence of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo> was seen in CSF of the prolonged group as compared with in cerebral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of A-V shunt was suggested in the cerebral circulation from the blood gas findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The experimental results indicates that prolonged cerebral vasospams phenomenon causes persistent hypoxic state in the cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, cellular metabolism of cerebral tissue will be probably maintained by oxygen supply necessary to cellular respiration through the blood-brain barrier from the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
