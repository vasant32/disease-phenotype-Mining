<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, a diversity of approaches to treating vasospasm has been developed, among them hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution (deriving its abbreviated name 3H-therapy) offers certain advantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time a number of aspects of application of this approach remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> (elevated linear systolic blood flow velocity &gt; or = 200 cm/s) who had been operated on in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period of aneurysmal SAH were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of them, 18 patients had undergone hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution (3H-therapy) under guidance of systemic hemodynamics, by using a Swan-Ganz catheter (these patients formed a study group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients who had not undergone 3H-therapy under invasive monitoring of systemic hemodynamics constituted a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution was performed by means of continuous intravenous infusion of a combination of colloid-crystalloid solutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The therapy was considered to be adequate by meeting the following requirements: maintenance of cardiac index not less 3.5 l/min/m2, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure below 14-16 mm Hg or central venous pressure under to 8-10 mm Hg, packed cell volume below 28-32%, and systolic blood pressure under 200 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution (3H-therapy) applied to patients operated on in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period of aneurysmal SAH was effective in increasing cardiac output, central venous pressure, systemic arterial pressure and hence cerebral perfusion with the minimum number of complications unassociated with the use of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This permitted a reduction in mortality rates in patients with baseline Hunt-Hess grade I-III SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the same time, it should be emphasized that 3H-therapy may be used in neurosurgical patients, by thoroughly monitoring the parameters of central hemodynamics, blood coagulation system, cerebral circulation and, desirably, intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
