<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (a metabolite of prostacyclin), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (a metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi>) were measured in both treated and untreated (n = 7) dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In untreated dogs, the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> increased 94-fold by Day 8 after the first injection of blood and was strongly and positively correlated with the degree of angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smaller increases in cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha occurred after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>; the magnitude of these increases was also reduced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> or high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
