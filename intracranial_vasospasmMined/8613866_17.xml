<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report the case of a patient with paradoxical aggravation of cerebral arterial narrowing during selective intraarterial papaverine infusion intended to treat vasospasm following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 48-year-old man presented to the authors' service with symptomatic vasospasm 10 days after experiencing an SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ruptured anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was surgically obliterated the following day, and thereafter maximum hypervolemic and hypertensive therapies were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the patient remained lethargic, and a stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-computerized tomography (CT) cerebral blood flow (CBF) study revealed CBF to be 15 cc/100 g/minute in the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and 25 cc/100 g/minute in the right ACA territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteriography demonstrated diffuse severe left ACA and mild left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In response intraarterial papaverine was infused into the internal carotid artery just proximal to the ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the infusion the patient became aphasic and exhibited right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arteriography performed immediately after the intraarterial papaverine infusion revealed diffuse exacerbation of vasospasm in the distal ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A repeat <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-CT CBF study showed that CBF in the left ACA and the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> had drastically decreased (2 cc/100 g/minute and 10 cc/100 g/minute, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite aggressive management, infarction ultimately developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first clinical case to illustrate a paradoxical effect of intraarterial papaverine treatment for vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms of this paradoxical response and potential therapeutic reactions are reviewed </plain></SENT>
