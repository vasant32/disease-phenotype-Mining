<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A group of 112 consecutive patients who initially had no neurological deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was followed intensively for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four were in neurological Grade I or II (Hunt and Hess classification) on arrival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A hundred patients underwent late surgery but, despite excellent surgical results, major morbidity and mortality rates were observed related to preoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the preoperative period, 14 (13%) rebled, 41 (37%) had symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and 24 (21%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> that required treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 100 surgical patients, 73 were in Grade I or II, 26 in Grade III, and one in Grade IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had intraoperative neurological complications, and two had delayed postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients died during hospitalization, but only one as a result of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six others died during the year following discharge of causes unrelated to the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ultimate functional outcome at 1 year of these initially good-risk patients was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 46% were fully recovered, and 25% reported emotional or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849888" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological disturbances</z:e> that interfered with their daily lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent could return to their previous jobs or a comparable position, and 20% obtained lesser employment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Management mortality at 1 year was 11%, and morbidity related to persistent neurological deficits (mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> from vasospasm) was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, management mortality and morbidity at 1 year was 31%, and the number of patients returning to useful life was disappointing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors support the suggestion by previous workers that an analysis of at least the 6-month and perhaps the 1-year outcome (especially management mortality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) provides the most important parameter for judging outcome and comparing different management protocols for SAH </plain></SENT>
