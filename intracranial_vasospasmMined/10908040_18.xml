<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> involves breakdown of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase (HO) and sequestration of the released iron in ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> induces these proteins in cerebral arteries and, if so, in which cells they are produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether the changes correlated with vasospasm also was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was created in monkeys, and vasospasm was assessed by angiography in cohorts of animals killed 3, 7, or 14 days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ferritin and HO-1 messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and protein were measured by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>-side and control-side cerebral arteries and brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The location of these proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was significant vasospasm 3 and 7 days but not 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for HO-1 or ferritin in cerebral arteries or brain tissue at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in HO-1 and ferritin protein in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>-side compared with control-side cerebral arteries at 3, 7, and 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in HO-1 protein was maximal at 3 days, whereas the increase in ferritin protein was maximal at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no detectable increase in HO-1 or ferritin protein in brain tissue at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry localized HO-1 protein and ferritin to cells in the adventitia of the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is associated with a significant increase in HO-1 and ferritin proteins in cerebral arteries that begins at least as early as 3 days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and that persists for up to 14 days </plain></SENT>
