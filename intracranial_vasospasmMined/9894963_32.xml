<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> delayed type of cerebral vasoconstriction that occurs after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is now the most important cause of mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> for patients who initially survive the rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although intravascular volume expansion and cardiac performance enhancement have had a profound impact on the treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> delayed type of cerebral vasoconstriction, this form of treatment is not tolerated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and is unhelpful in some </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A more specific and more reliable treatment for this condition has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous work in an animal model has demonstrated the efficacy of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-donating compounds in reversing severe cerebral vasoconstriction when delivered to the adventitial side of the blood vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clinical study was initiated after receiving approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration and the institutional review board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Three cases of prompt and substantial reversal of medically refractory vasospasm occurring after aneurysmal SAH in humans using an intrathecally administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> and clinical, angiographic, and ultrasonographic documentation are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients developed severe vasospasm refractory to medical treatment 5 to 12 days after sustaining aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients manifested stupor of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of 7) and new focal neurological deficit (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The condition was angiographically demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patients were treated with intrathecally administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, which caused the reversal of vasospasm, which was documented by angiography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography up to 54 hours later and also by dramatic clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications related to intracranial pressure elevation, changes in vital signs, and hemodynamic parameters were not observed during or after the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Radiographic evidence of the reversal of vasospasm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes of the treated patients were excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and stupor that resolved or markedly improved (within several days, two patients; within 12 hours, one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients were discharged and were living at home at the time of manuscript submission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These preliminary observations suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> delivered by an intrathecal route of administration may be a useful treatment for severe vasospasm complicating SAH in humans </plain></SENT>
