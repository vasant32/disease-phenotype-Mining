<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our recent studies support the hypothesis that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, released from nitrergic nerves, plays a crucial role as a neurotransmitter in vasodilating cerebral arteries from primate and subprimate mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated, by using arterial angiography, that electrical stimulation of the pterygopalatine ganglion produced vasodilatation of ipsilateral cerebral arteries of anesthetized Japanese monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response was abolished by intravenous injections of N(G)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Denervation of the ganglion elicited cerebral vasoconstriction, indicating that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> nerves from the vasomotor center were tonically active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the greater petrosal nerve, upstream of the pterygopalatine ganglion, also elicited cerebral vasodilatation, which was abolished by treatment with the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor and with hexamethonium, indicating that the nerve is in connection via synapses with the nitrergic nerve innervating cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endogenous nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> released from the nerve may contribute to the maintenance of blood flow in major cerebral arteries necessary to supply blood to the different brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without this influence, cerebral arteries might be constricted to the extent that blood flow is impeded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first direct evidence indicating an important role of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> liberated by pre- and postganglionic nerve stimulation in the control of cerebral arterial tone in primates </plain></SENT>
