<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This time, the authors investigated the etiology by immunological research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following results were obtained, Out of 13 cases of SAH due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>, angiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was observed in 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these 9 cases, tendency of decrease in the number of peripheral blood T lymphocytes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on the lymphocyte PHA (phytohemagglutinin) and Con A (concanavalin A) response, and tuberculin anergy were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of cell-mediated immunity function might induce the occurrence of so-called late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
