<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery, which was compared with day 0 angiogram, decreased gradually in a time-dependent manner from day 3 (80%), day 5 (68%) through day 7 (53.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of MAPK (p44/42) immunoprecipitation peaked on day 3 and remained enhanced through day 7 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEK inhibitor PD98059 significantly reduced p44/42 MAPK immunoprecipitation and significantly reversed vasospasm and increased residual diameter to 79.0% on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that p44/42 MAPK kinase is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MEK inhibitor PD98059 might be useful in the treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
