<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess whether prophylactic postoperative intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABC) reduces the risk of poor outcome because of vasospasm following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> relative to conventional hypervolemic therapy (HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a single-center, parallel group randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients suffering a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> at high risk of vasospasm were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly allocated to receive prophylactic IABC (n=35) or HT (n=36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was Glasgow Outcome and SF-36 scores assessed at 6 months by a blinded and independent observer and analyzed by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary analysis of physiological parameters was by treatment performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients in each arm had a good outcome (P=0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in mean SF-36 score (t=0.39, P=0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no long-term complications secondary to IABC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in preload (pulmonary artery wedge pressure, P=0.97) or afterload (mean arterial pressure, P=0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IABC was associated with a lower cardiac output (P=0.002) and higher systemic vascular resistance (P=0.005), although for both groups mean cardiac output was &gt;6 L/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was not different between groups: HT=41.5 (SD 7.2), IABP=44.9 (SD 8.6) mL/100 g/min (P=0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, prophylactic IABC did not improve perfusion indices or confer any clinical benefit following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The study was small, however, and cannot be extrapolated to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> and medically refractory symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical Trial Registration- This trial was not registered because enrolment began prior to July 1, 2005 </plain></SENT>
