<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study examined the difference in the incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> supplementation in aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective analysis was performed in 157 patients diagnosed with aneurysmal SAH from January 2007 to December 2011 at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients (44.6%) received a combination treatment of nimodipine with <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and 87 patients (55.4%) received only nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A matched case-control study using propensity scores was conducted and 41 subjects were selected from each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A dosage of 64 mmol/day of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> was administrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The infusion of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (n=7, 17.1%, p=0.29) compared with simple nimodipine injection (n=11, 26.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratios of good clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale 0-2) at 6 months were similar, being 78% in the combination treatment group and 80.5% in the nimodipine only group (p=0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportions of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was not significantly lower in patients with combination treatment (n=2, 4.9% vs. n=3, 7.3%; p=0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentrations between the patients with symptomatic vasospasm and without vasospasm who had <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No major complications associated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> supplementation (64 mmol/day) may not be beneficial for the reduction of the incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
