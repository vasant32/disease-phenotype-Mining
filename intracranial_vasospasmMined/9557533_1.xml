<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Changes in contractile force were measured during isometric contraction of the bovine middle cerebral artery caused by stimulation of various receptors and by application of high K+, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>, and protein kinase C (PKC)-activators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)-inhibitors, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> and tyrphostin, were applied before testing the effect on the contractions or during the maximal plateau of the contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, endothelin-1, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> were significantly and dose-dependently depressed by the PTK-inhibitors (IC50 2-15 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, contractions were significantly augmented by 1 microM pervanadate, an inhibitor of phosphoprotein tyrosine phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lineweaver-Burk plotting of the dose-response curves with an increase in inhibitor concentration indicated that the receptor affinity for each <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> remained unchanged in spite of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the effect was not significant, contractions induced by both high K+ and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> were also depressed slightly by PTK-inhibitors in the same range of concentrations used for receptor-induced contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contractions induced by PKC-activators, such as 1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-sn-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12,13-diacetate, were significantly depressed by PTK-inhibitors at concentrations similar to those used for receptor-induced contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that receptor stimulations which produce sequential activation of phospholipase C and PKC can activate PTK and trigger the so-called "PTK-cascade" causing a sustained or long-lasting contraction similar to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> observed clinically </plain></SENT>
