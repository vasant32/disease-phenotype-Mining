<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The "double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>" model in the rat is frequently used to simulate delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an exact neurological and angiographic characterization of the CVS is not available for this model so far and is provided in the present investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) at 3 tesla magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) tomography was implemented to assess the reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective, randomized setting CVS was induced by injection of 0.2 ml autologous blood twice in the cisterna magna of 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surviving animals were examined on Days 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 and compared to a sham operated control group (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were neurologically graded between 0 and 3, followed by MRI and selective digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative CBF was set in relation to the perfusion of the masseter muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological state was significantly worsened on Day 2 (Grade 3), 3 (Grade 3), and 5 (Grade 2) (medians) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative CBF/muscle BF ratio (2.5 +/- 0.8 (SAH) versus 9.2 +/- 1.3 (sham) (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and the basilar artery (BA) diameter (0.15 +/- 0.02 mm (SAH) versus 0.32 +/- 0.01 mm (sham) were significantly decreased on Day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation between relative CBF/muscle BF ratio and BA diameter was 0.70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A valid and reproducible CVS simulation was proven by neurological score, DSA, and PWI on Day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data demonstrate the practicability and validity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> PWI for the monitoring of CVS in a rat SAH model </plain></SENT>
