<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beta-actin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and structural change of its 3' untranslated region (UTR) which are considered a non-specific marker for vascular remodeling, were examined by Northern analysis and polymerase chain reaction analysis in a canine basilar artery after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes in the area of tunica media in the basilar artery were also examined histopathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased beta-actin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and its structural changes of 3' UTR in the vasospastic basilar artery were markedly seen 7 and 14 days after SAH accompanied by increased area of tunica media in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that vascular remodeling occurs and takes part in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
