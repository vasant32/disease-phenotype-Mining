<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a prospected, randomized, controlled study and included 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients received hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution fluid therapy; the other 16 patients received normovolemic fluid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored for at least 12 days, with clinical assessments, transcranial Doppler recordings, single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scanning, and routine computed tomographic scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For fluid balance monitoring, a number of blood samples were obtained on a daily basis and continuous central venous pressure and mean arterial blood pressure measurements were performed for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received intravenous nimodipine infusions between Day 1 and Day 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>End points of this study were clinical outcomes, clinically evident and transcranial Doppler sonography-evident vasospasm, SPECT findings, complications, and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical examinations (using the Glasgow Outcome Scale) performed 1 year after discharge, together with neuropsychological assessments and SPECT scanning, were the basis for the evaluation of clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were observed between the two groups with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (as observed clinically or on transcranial Doppler recordings) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When regional cerebral blood flow was evaluated by means of SPECT analysis performed on Day 12 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, no differences were revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-year clinical follow-up assessments (with the Glasgow Outcome Scale), including SPECT findings and neuropsychological function results, did not demonstrate any significant group differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Costs were higher and complications were more frequent for the hyperdynamic therapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neither early nor late outcome measures revealed any significant differences between the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> treatment models </plain></SENT>
