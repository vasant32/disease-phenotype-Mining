<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ levels as biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we examined changes in levels over time and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) epsilon4 allele presence after SAH in individuals with and without vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that individuals with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E levels, increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ levels and/or at least one copy of the APOE epsilon4 allele would have vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daily samples from 50 participants, aged 18-75, with SAH were used to quantify <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was verified using cerebral angiogram and/or elevated transcranial Dopplers in combination with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E levels were higher in individuals with the APOE epsilon4 allele (p = .02) or angiographic vasospasm (p = .01), but there were no differences between individuals with and without symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E levels over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the epsilon4 allele had lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ levels (p = .02) with trends suggesting a different pattern of change over time (p = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ levels were lower in individuals with symptomatic vasospasm (p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
