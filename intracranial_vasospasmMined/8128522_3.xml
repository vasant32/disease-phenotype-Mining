<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are many experimental models for studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no ideal model has been established thus far to comparatively reproduce the ischemic state of the brain that may occur in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, we attempted to induce severe vasospasm in rabbits by using an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>-rich blood product prepared from hemolyzed arterial blood and evaluate neurological symptoms, cerebral angiogram, cerebral blood flow, and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinically significant neurological symptoms were observed in about half of the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between angiographic results of the vasospastic state of the main artery and the severity of neurological symptoms observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the cerebral blood flow was significantly lower than in the control group and significantly correlated with the severity of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On histological examination, lesions were found in about half of the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Development of obvious infarction was found more frequently than in other reported models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that this model is appropriate as an experimental model of vasospasm occurring after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and is especially useful in that it induces vasospasm intense enough to cause obvious infarction </plain></SENT>
