<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of one inhibitor of calcium-activated proteolysis, z-Leu-Phe-CONH-morpholene (zLF), on cerebrovascular constriction was examined in two experimental paradigms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first paradigm, the rabbit basilar artery (BA) was visualized via a transclival exposure, and its diameter was monitored using videomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second experimental paradigm two intracisternal injections of autologous blood were administered to mimic a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BA was visualized via the transclival exposure, and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (OxyHb), a known pathogenic agent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, elicited vasoconstriction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, reducing arterial diameter to approximately 75% of resting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with zLF (100, 200, or 300 microM) attenuated vasoconstriction induced by OxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an experimental model of SAH, the diameter of the BA was reduced after the first injection of blood to approximately 67% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting levels when measured 3 to 4 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This vasospastic response was reversed significantly by topical application of zLF (100 microM); vascular diameter was increased to approximately 84% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OxyHb-induced constriction and blood-induced vasospasm are sensitive to an inhibitor of the proteolytic enzyme, calpain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations indicate an important role for calcium-activated proteolysis in the development and maintenance of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, it may be inferred from the data that inhibitors of calcium-activated proteolysis may be useful therapeutic agents for treating this form of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
