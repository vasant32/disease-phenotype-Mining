<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We had previously reported that plasma concentrations of endothelin (ET) decreased significantly in the operating room during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to explore whether changes in plasma ET and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) concentrations were altered during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> anesthesia in patients undergoing clipping of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients scheduled for selective craniotomy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A catheter was inserted into the radial artery for blood sampling before anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial plasma concentrations of ET and CGRP were determined before induction, after dura incision, after clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and 30 minutes after clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET concentrations in the plasma increased significantly after clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> compared with concentrations after dura incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant changes in ET levels were found after anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of CGRP decreased significantly during anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This evidence suggests that direct stimulation of the intracalvarium blood vessel before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping may increase ET; however, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> did not decrease ET, in contrast with our previously reported findings for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Considering the well-recognized vasodilatory effect of CGRP, it is possible that a decrease in the plasma concentration of CGRP plays a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, which is often seen postoperatively </plain></SENT>
