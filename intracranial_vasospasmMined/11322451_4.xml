<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blocking ET-converting enzyme activity may be a promising approach to the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, the effects of several putative ET-converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> were investigated after intracisternal application in rabbits, to inhibit basilar artery contractions induced by big ET-1 (2 x 10(-6) mol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the group pretreated with [D-Val22]big ET-1[16-38] (2 x 10(-5) mol/L) (n = 8), the angiographically measured diameter of the basilar artery changed from 0.63 +/- 0.12 mm to 0.66 +/- 0.12 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control group (n = 8), the diameter of the basilar artery decreased from 0.71 +/- 0.13 mm to 0.57 +/- 0.15 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results corresponded to an increase in vessel diameter of 5 +/- 10% in the treatment group and a decrease in vessel diameter of 20 +/- 16% in the control group (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> (2 x 10(-4) mol/L) (n = 8), the angiographically measured diameter of the basilar artery changed from 0.64 +/- 0.11 mm to 0.71 +/- 0.10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results corresponded to an increase in vessel diameter of 14 +/- 19% in the treatment group, compared with a decrease in vessel diameter of 20 +/- 16% in the control group (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that [D-Val22]big ET-1[16-38] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> act as highly potent ET-converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>, affecting big ET-1-induced contraction of the rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
