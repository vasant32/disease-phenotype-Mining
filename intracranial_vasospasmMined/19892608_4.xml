<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mono and dioxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites, involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury, may serve as indicators of SV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study developed a quantitative UPLC-MS/MS method to simultaneously measure hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi>), dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DiHETrE), and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) metabolites of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we determined the recovery of these metabolites from <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53243">polyvinylchloride</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) bags used for CSF collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear calibration curves ranging from 0.208 to 33.3 ng/ml were validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inter-day and intra-day variance was less than 15% at most concentrations with extraction efficiency greater than 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The matrix did not affect the reproducibility and reliability of the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In CSF samples, peak concentrations of 8,9-DiHETrE, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi>, 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> ranged from 0.293 to 24.9 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In rat brain cortical tissue samples, concentrations of 20-, 15-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi>, 8,9-EET, and 14,15-, 11,12-DiHETrE ranged from 0.57 to 23.99 pmol/g wet tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In rat cortical microsomal incubates, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 metabolites were measured with formation rates ranging from 0.03 to 7.77 pmol/mg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> and EET metabolites were significantly altered by contact with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> bags at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the simultaneous measurement of these compounds in human CSF and rat brain can be achieved with a UPLC-MS/MS system and that this method is necessary for evaluation of these metabolites as potential quantitative biomarkers in future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
