<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, lesser doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (0.1 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours), although better than no treatment at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, were significantly less effective than the higher dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> can prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> experimental vasospasm from occurring only when given in high doses (30 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
