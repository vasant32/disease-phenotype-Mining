<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and ATP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients or in an animal model of vasospasm have not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 12 mongrel dogs underwent a double blood injection via the cisterna magna on day 0 and 2, after an initial collection of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day 3, 5 or 7, the dogs were sacrificed after a second collection of CSF </plain></SENT>
