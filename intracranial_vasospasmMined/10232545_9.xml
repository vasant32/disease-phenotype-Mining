<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients now undergo empirical hyperdynamic vasospasm therapy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report two cases of iatrogenic hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> occurring during hyperdynamic therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> is a syndrome of rapidly evolving generalized or focal cerebral symptoms occurring in the setting of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which is reversible with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The syndrome can be diagnosed in the appropriate clinical setting with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging that demonstrates characteristic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases, decreasing the blood pressure resulted in neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the setting of induced hypertensive/hypervolemic therapy for vasospasm, hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> should be considered as a potentially reversible cause of delayed neurological decline </plain></SENT>
