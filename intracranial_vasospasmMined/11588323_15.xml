<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed this patient population in our institution to address these issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1992 and 1999, 440 patients presented to our institution with aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This sample was retrospectively analyzed to determine which patients had used cocaine within 72 hours of aSAH as documented by urine toxicology studies or patient history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were then compared with control aSAH patients without recent cocaine exposure through univariable and multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven aSAH patients (6.1% of total) had either urine toxicology positive for cocaine metabolites (20 patients, 74%) or a history of cocaine use within 72 hours of aSAH (7 patients, 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cocaine users were more likely to experience <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> defined as a delayed clinical deficit (from 3 to 16 days after aSAH) unexplained by concurrent CT scan and either responsive to hypervolemic and/or hypertensive therapy or accompanied by angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing than control subjects (63% versus 30%; odds ratio [OR], 3.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.77 to 8.62; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients using cocaine were younger than control subjects (mean age, 36 versus 52 years; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the anterior circulation were observed more frequently in cocaine users than in control subjects (97% versus 84%; OR, 6.89; 95% CI, 1.18 to 47.47; P=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was not observed, however, in the discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores between the 2 groups (P=0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences were not observed between the 2 groups when the distributions of sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, admission Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> grade, and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with vasospasm and discharge GOS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only a thick blood clot on the admission CT (OR, 7.46; 95% CI, 3.95 to 14.08; P&lt;0.0001) and recent cocaine use (OR, 6.41; 95% CI, 2.14 to 19.23; P=0.0009) were independently associated with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cocaine use was not independently associated with the discharge GOS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is an increased prevalence of vasospasm in aSAH patients with recent cocaine exposure but no difference in clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, these patients are younger and more likely to have anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
