<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the curative effect of Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 34 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with early GDC embolization within 6 days after the rupture, 6 being of grade I, 23 of grade II, 4 of grade III and 1 of grade IV according to Hunt-Hess grading, were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were treated within 3 days, and 20 patients were treated in the 4th to 6th days after the rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cases of wide-neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were embolized with Medtronic AVE stent supported GDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was used to observe the effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiography showed complete occlusion in 28 cases and 90% occlusion in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was ruptured during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The caudal tip of GDC protruded to the parent vessel in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases failed to be embolized due to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no mortality and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No re-rupture occurred in the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Less invasive and with less risk and complication, early GDC embolization is one of the ideal therapeutic methods to manage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
