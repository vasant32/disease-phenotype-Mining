<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presently, there is no practical grading system to categorize the severity of SAH depending on the amount of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We outline a simple and objective novel SAH grading system by examining the subarachnoid blood clots in the basal cisterns, and evaluate for correlation with neurological status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, known to reduce vasospasm, were examined using this grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into three groups: sham-operated (n=24), SAH (n=32), and SAH+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (n=25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-resolution brain pictures were used to grade the severity of SAH and categorize animals into mild, moderate and severe groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SAH grades were compared with neurological scores and internal carotid artery parameters such as diameter, perimeter and wall thickness at 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two investigators verified the grading system independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SAH grade showed linear correlation functionally with neurological status (r=0.42, p&lt;0.01) and morphometrically with the degree of vasospasm (|r|&gt;0.7, p&lt;0.01), and also between two independent investigators (r=0.937, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
