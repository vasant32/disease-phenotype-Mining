<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The effect of transluminal balloon angioplasty on cerebral biochemical monitoring during treatment of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: In a 36-year-old man, an anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> caused an SAH (Hunt and Hess Grade IV, Fisher Grade III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After clipping, intraparenchymal monitoring (intracranial pressure, brain tissue oxygen tension [P(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>], and microdialysis sampling of extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>) was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities obtained by transcranial Doppler sonography increased in the internal carotid artery (ICA)/middle cerebral artery bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After a decrease of P(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> to less than 2 mm Hg and an increase of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio to 44 in the territorial region of the left ICA, angiography demonstrated a 70 to 80% stenosis of the left ICA, which was dilated by a temporary occlusion balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This maneuver normalized the ICA diameter, P(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> increased immediately from 1.5 to 40 mm Hg, the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio decreased from 44 to 30, and extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased from 0.4 to 0.9 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No major changes in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> or intracranial pressure were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the clinical follow-up, the patient showed a good recovery 6 months after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transluminal balloon angioplasty led to a continuous and effective resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> observed by sustained, improved cerebral biochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both P(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio might provide an early diagnosis of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH and continuous surveillance of threatened tissue regions after transluminal balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
