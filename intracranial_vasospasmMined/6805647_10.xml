<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 148 patients presenting within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> were assigned at random to receive standard management only or standard management and treatment with the adrenergic-blocking agents <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and phentolamine (or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> alone) for three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-four patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessment at four weeks showed a strong trend for less neurological deficit in the treated group, almost statistically significant (p=0.053) in the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first month the treated group suffered fewer episodes of clinical deterioration consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e>: thus more treated patients underwent operation and those who did had a better outcome (p=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At one year fewer were dead or disabled (unable to work) in the treated group; a significant difference for women (p=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms for these actions may include a reduction in pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, prevention of myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, a reduction in plasma renin activity, nd a reduction in cerebral oxygen requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that early adrenergic blockade benefits patients (particularly women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> for up to one year in terms of lesser neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beta-blocker rather than alpha-blockade appears to be the useful component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A randomised, blind extension of the present study using long-acting <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and placebo has shown a significant (p=0.026) decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and significantly (p=0.003) fewer poor results in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
