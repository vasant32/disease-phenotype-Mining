<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The target population was patients with ruptured saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> causing severe SAH, placing them at high risk for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of a single 10 ml intraoperative injection of either vehicle buffer solution or rt-PA (1 mg/ml) into the opened basal subarachnoid cisterns immediately following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major efficacy endpoint in this trial was angiographic vasospasm, and the major safety concern was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred patients were randomized, 49 to placebo and 51 to rt-PA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline population characteristics were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> on computed tomographic scans was also similar between groups: 87.2% of both placebo and rt-PA treated patients had thick subarachnoid clots, and the rates for intracerebral and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> were, respectively, 16.3% and 22.5% for placebo and 23.5% and 21.6% for rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine randomized patients did not receive treatment in the operating room, and in 8 this was due to conditions felt unsafe for the administration of a fibrinolytic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of angiographic vasospasm measured between the seventh and eleventh day following SAH was similar between the two groups, with arterial narrowing detected in 74.4% of dosed placebo patients and 64.6% of rt-PA treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was a trend toward lesser degrees of vasospasm in the rt-PA treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rates for no or mild, moderate, and severe vasospasm were 69%, 16% and 15% in the rt-PA treated group, versus 42%, 35% and 23% in the placebo group (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When only those patients with thick subarachnoid clots were considered at the treating centers, there was a 56% relative risk reduction of severe vasospasm in the rt-PA treated group, which was significant (P = 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
