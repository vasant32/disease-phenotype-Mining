<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major disadvantage of this therapy is the increase in ischemic complications, which is supposed to be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the effect of short-term antifibrinolytic therapy on arterial vessel narrowing after SAH was investigated utilizing the rat femoral artery vasospasm model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups of six animals each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autologous blood (0.1 mL) was applied to the 1-cm segment of right femoral artery wrapped with a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> cuff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Group 1 the animals did not receive any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Groups 2, 3, and 4 150 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi> (AMCA) was given orally for 3, 5, or 7 days respectively, starting from postoperative day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 1 cm segment of each femoral artery was harvested on the 8(th) postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphologic analyses were performed using the parameters, radial wall thickness and cross <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area under the light microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, two samples from each group were examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM) to confirm the morphologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a gradual decrease in cross <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area and gradual increase in vessel wall thickness directly proportional with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the vasospastic changes that occurred in Group 2 (received AMCA for 3 days) were not significantly different from those of Group 1 (nontreated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was concluded that antifibrinolytic treatment for the first 3 days may prove useful in cases of clinical aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, if this treatment is used for more than 3 days, arterial vessel narrowing is significantly increased </plain></SENT>
