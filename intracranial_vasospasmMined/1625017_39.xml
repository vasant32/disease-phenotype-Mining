<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> on endothelin biosynthesis in cultured endothelial cells were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (0.01 to 100 microM) produced concentration-dependent increases in immunoreactive endothelin levels in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell-conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median effective concentration for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>-induced increases in immunoreactive endothelin levels was approximately 0.5 microM, and the maximum stimulation of immunoreactive endothelin levels was approximately 5.5-fold over basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to directly stimulating basal production of immunoreactive endothelin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> significantly augmented immunoreactive endothelin production following platelet-mediated stimulation of endothelin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An l-arginine analog inhibitor of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, L-NG-monomethyl arginine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>, 200 microM), did not significantly affect basal immunoreactive endothelin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> significantly augmented platelet-induced immunoreactive endothelin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> (10 microM), an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, did not significantly affect basal immunoreactive endothelin levels, nor did it significantly affect the platelet-mediated stimulation of immunoreactive endothelin production in cultured endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results reveal that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> can directly stimulate endothelin biosynthesis in cultured endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This newly identified property of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> suggests a potential mechanism for the sustained and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
