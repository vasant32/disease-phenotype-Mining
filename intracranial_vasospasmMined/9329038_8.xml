<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five dogs were exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the Ebselen-treated group (6 dogs), 50 mg kg-1 of Ebselen was administered twice a day, for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other 19 dogs without administration of Ebselen were used as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Ebselen-treated group, the basilar artery on Day 7 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was constricted to 68.1 +/- 6.4% (mean +/- SD, n = 6) of the angiographic diameter on Day 0, before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This percentage was significantly larger than the 41.3 +/- 4.6% (n = 19) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery segment obtained on Day 7 in the Ebselen-treated group produced 3.32 +/- 1.82 nmol of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid/mg protein/5 minutes (n = 5), significantly less than the 6.73 +/- 0.95 (n = 3) produced by the artery in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, administration of Ebselen suppressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> 5-lipoxygenase activation and had a beneficial effect on angiographically detected delayed vasospasm </plain></SENT>
