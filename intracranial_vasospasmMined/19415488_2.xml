<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight rats (225-250 g) were divided into four groups equally: group 1; control, group 2; SAH, group 3; SAH plus placebo, and group 4; SAH plus <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used double haemorrhage method for SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning 6 h after SAH, 20 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> or equal volume of 0.9% saline was administered intraperitoneally twice daily for 5 days to groups 3 and 4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> or 0.9% saline injections were continued up to fifth day after SAH and rats were sacrificed at the end of this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain sections at the level of the pons were examined by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lumen diameter and the vessel wall thickness of basilar artery were measured using a micrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), the brain levels of an intrinsic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and a NO regulator arginase activities were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brain levels of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine, a nitrosative stress parameter immunohistochemiacally determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> administration ameliorated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by increasing serum NO level and decreasing the brain the levels of arginase and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that increased brain arginase activity after SAH may also have a significant role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm by limiting the availability of arginine for NO production </plain></SENT>
