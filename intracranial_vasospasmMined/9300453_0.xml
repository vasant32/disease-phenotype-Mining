<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We described an autopsy case of a ruptured aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> treated with endovascular embolization by interlocking detachable coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An 85-year-old male presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiogram revealed a right internal carotid-posterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-operative angiogram revealed complete obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, except for its orifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, tissue plasminogen activator was intrathecally perfused for anti-vasospasm treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiogram showed stable obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and no particular findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient had been recovering without any neurological deficits, but died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> on the 25th day after the embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autopsy findings revealed the disappearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and no visible finding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inner lumen of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was occupied by a mixture of the coils and the clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The surface of the embolized coils was directly observed through the orifice of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> without any membranous substance from the inner lumen of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This pathological finding is different from the previously reported animal models in which the surface of the embolized coils was covered with endothelial membrane 2 weeks after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further examinations are required to clarify the pathogenesis of the endothelial regrowth </plain></SENT>
