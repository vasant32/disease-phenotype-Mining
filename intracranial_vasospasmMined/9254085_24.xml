<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They also sought to determine the most clinically meaningful criteria for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with varying degrees of moderate-to-severe head injury were monitored using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography and intravenous 133Xe-cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome was determined at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using TCD ultrasonography, mean flow velocities were determined for the middle cerebral artery (V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), 149 patients) and basilar artery (V(BA), 126 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recordings of the mean extracranial internal carotid artery velocity (V(EC-ICA)) were also performed to determine the hemispheric ratio (V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(EC-ICA), 147 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow measurements were obtained in 91 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concurrent TCD and CBF data from 85 patients were used to calculate a "spasm index" (the V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or V(BA), respectively, divided by the hemispheric or global CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the clinical significance of elevated flow velocity, hemispheric ratio, and spasm index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed as having <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or BA vasospasm on the basis of TCD-derived criteria alone had a significantly worse outcome than patients without vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When CBF was considered, hemodynamically significant vasospasm, as defined by an elevated spasm index, was even more strongly associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression analysis confirmed that hemodynamically significant vasospasm was a significant predictor of poor outcome, independent of the effects of admission Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the results of this study, the authors suggest that the important factor impacting on outcome is not vasospasm per se, but hemodynamically significant vasospasm with low CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings show that vasospasm is a pathophysiologically important posttraumatic secondary insult, which is best diagnosed by the combined use of TCD and CBF measurements </plain></SENT>
