<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability in patients suffering from aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, a persistent, progressive, and often irreversible constriction of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A wide array of pathological changes occur in cerebral arteries following SAH, with endothelial injury being the earliest and most consistent one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since intact endothelium modulates many reflexes that influence vascular tone, damage to them may represent a significant contributor to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Changes in local cerebellar blood flow (LCBF) and pathological alterations in major cerebral arteries were studied and compared in rats at various time intervals following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAH induced by the subarachnoid injection of 0.3 ml of whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sham rats received a subarachnoid injection of 0.3 ml of isotonic saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Except for an immediate but transient decrease, LCBF remained unchanged over a 3 day period following saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, there were no pathological alterations in cerebral arteries of saline-injected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the subarachnoid injection of whole blood produced significant changes in both LCBF and cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within 30 minutes post-blood injection, LCBF became significantly decreased and remained so for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, within 24 hours, LCBF had returned to control levels where it remained for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endothelial injury was observed in the basilar and middle cerebral arteries from 30 minutes through 4 hours, the same periods in which LCBF was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Within 24 hours, the time period in which LCBF had rebounded to control ranges, cerebral arteries showed no evidence of endothelial damage and resembled control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate a direct correlation between changes in LCBF and the structural integrity of endothelial cells in the early stages following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The lack of chronically depressed LCBF (after 1 day) may be related to the quick structural repair of endothelium </plain></SENT>
