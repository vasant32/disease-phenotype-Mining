<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the effect of the spinal cord stimulation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> has been investigated widely, neurological dysfunction induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the effect of the spinal cord stimulation on neurological dysfunction have not been investigated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the neurological dysfunction induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and whether the spinal cord stimulation improves this neurological dysfunction or not in New Zealand <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into sham and experiment groups: Sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor evoked potentials were recorded before experimental procedure was performed in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Just after, intracisternal saline was injected and 3 days later a stimulation electrode was placed in the cervical epidural space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor evoked potentials were recorded but electrical stimulation was not applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Firstly, motor evoked potentials had been recorded before experimental procedure was performed in also this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After then a stimulation electrode was placed in the cervical epidural space of the animals in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> procedure was performed 3 days ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Motor evoked potentials were recorded both before and after spinal cord stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Motor evoked potential latencies and amplitudes did not change in the sham operation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But, motor evoked potential latencies extended and the amplitudes decreased in the experiment group before spinal cord stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Spinal cord stimulation improved the changes occurring in latencies and amplitudes in the experiment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Spinal cord stimulation improves the neurological dysfunction induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and motor evoked potentials recording is a reliable electrophysiological method to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and to assess the effects of different treatments in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
