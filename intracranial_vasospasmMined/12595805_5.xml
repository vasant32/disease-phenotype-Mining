<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (VS) may be revealed by cerebral angiography, during follow-up clinical examination with the occurrence of delayed ischemic deficit (DID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, transcranial Doppler (TCD) could be useful in determining the level of the velocimetric threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were, on a prospectively collected series of 460 patients, to assess angiographic VS incidence, to determine possible risk factors, and to evaluate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: A total of 460 patients consecutively operated on for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> located on the anterior portion of the circle of Willis (mean age 47.2 +/- 14 years, sex ratio F/M=1.18) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preventive treatment against VS was administered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the 10(th) day, we performed the following routine examinations: cerebral angiography, CT scan and TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic VS occurred in 38.5% of the patients, and the single risk factor was delayed admission (p=0.02, Mann-Whitney test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DID occurred in 15.6% and was complicated by cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 4.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk factors were admission date (p=0.001, Mann-Whitney test) and severity of arterial narrowing (significant tendency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic sensitivity of TCD decreased from 83.6% for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, to 66.6% for ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 40.6% for AcoA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis specificity remained between 88.6% and 97.6% for the 3 locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The unique risk factor for angiographic VS and DID was the admission date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TCD demonstrated high specificity but its sensitivity was too low for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> located far from the middle cerebral artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
