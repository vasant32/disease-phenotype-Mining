<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that human alpha CGRP (hCGRP) dilates spastic cerebral arteries after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the prophylactic potential of a sustained higher cerebrospinal fluid level of hCGRP against experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An hCGRP slow-release tablet (hCGRP s-r tablet) was developed for cisternal implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH was induced by percutaneous cisternal injection of autologous arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was initiated on day 1 (before SAH) and performed everyday </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hCGRP s-r tablet was implanted into the cisterna magna on day 2 in the treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spastic response of the basilar artery was maximized on day 4 in the non-treated (80.7% of day 1) and the placebo-treated (79.3%) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the arterial diameters on day 4 were 96.1% and 90.5% of day 1 in the groups implanted with hCGRP 24 micrograms and 153 micrograms s-r tablets, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also measured the concentration of hCGRP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following implantation of the hCGRP 24 micrograms s-r tablet in the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hCGRP concentration before implantation was below the dectable level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Following implantation, the hCGRP level in the CSF was 23.12 nmol/L on the second day and remained at elevated levels until the fifth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These experiments suggest that the intrathecal single implantation of the hCGRP s-r tablet could produce an elevated concentration of hCGRP in the CSF over five days and have prevented the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The hCGRP s-r tablet may be clinically applicable in the treatment of patients with SAH against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
