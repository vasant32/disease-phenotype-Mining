<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> with Nylon thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed at different time intervals, from one day to seven days after endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inducible NOS <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) expression was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the distribution of iNOS positive cells was immunohistochemically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the vascular tissue with a subarachnoid membrane, iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed from one day to seven days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inducible NOS positive cells were mainly recognized in the vascular tissue, but not in the brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of nitrotyrosine, an indicator of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> production was also examined immunohistochemically and nitrotyrosine-positive cells were observed almost at the same sites of iNOS induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of iNOS in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we measured the diameter of the middle cerebral artery in animals either treated or not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> (AG), a selective inhibitor of iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AG ameliorated the vasoconstrictive change after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are thus considered to provide molecular and immunohistochemical evidence showing that iNOS expression following SAH and NO produced by iNOS can develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
