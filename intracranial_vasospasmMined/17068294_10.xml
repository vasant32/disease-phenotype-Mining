<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (oxyhb) has been implicated in SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> as it causes cerebral artery constriction and increases tyrosine kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Voltage-dependent, Ca(2+)-selective and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-selective ion channels play an important role in the regulation of cerebral artery diameter and represent potential targets of oxyhb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we provide novel evidence that oxyhb selectively decreases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34385">4-aminopyridine</z:chebi> sensitive, voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel (K(v)) currents by approximately 30% in myocytes isolated from rabbit cerebral arteries but did not directly alter the activity of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels or large conductance Ca(2+)-activated (BK) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> (tyrphostin AG1478, tyrphostin A23, tyrphostin A25, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi>) abolished both oxyhb-induced suppression of K(v) channel currents and oxyhb-induced constriction of isolated cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The K(v) channel blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34385">4-aminopyridine</z:chebi> also inhibited oxyhb-induced cerebral artery constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed oxyhb-induced decrease in K(v) channel activity could represent either channel block, or a decrease in K(v) channel density on the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To explore whether oxyhb altered trafficking of K(v) channels to the plasma membrane, we used an antibody generated against an extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of K(v)1.5 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the presence of oxyhb, staining of K(v)1.5 on the plasma membrane surface was markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, oxyhb caused a loss of spatial distinction between staining with K(v)1.5 and the general anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-102 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that oxyhb-induced suppression of K(v) currents occurs via a mechanism involving enhanced tyrosine kinase activity and channel endocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This novel mechanism may contribute to oxyhb-induced cerebral artery constriction following SAH </plain></SENT>
