<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 45-year-old man was referred to our department 4th day after sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, emergency 3 D-CTA showed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> involving M 1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiography performed at the same day of the left internal carotid artery confirmed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> of the same vessel as 3 D-CTA, and furthermore demonstrated the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) genu <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The former was seen as a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> from brain CT findings (Fisher group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the 10th day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 3 D-CTA demonstrated the remaining severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> of the supraclinoid portion of left ICA and M 1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings at the conventional angiography subsequently performed were concordant with those of 3 D-CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was successfully treated with delayed surgical clipping for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> without the symptoms related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and discharged without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We consider that 3 D-CTA shows promise as a minimally invasive method of evaluating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and would take the place of the conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
