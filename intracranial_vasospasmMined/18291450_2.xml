<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence implicates voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels, in addition to calcium channels of various types, in the pathophysiological development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the ability of LTG, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug with multi-ion channel inhibition properties, to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and subsequent neural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five New Zealand white rabbits were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) control (no SAH, saline injection); (2) SAH alone; (3) SAH + LTG, 20 mg/kg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 72 hours after SAH, then basilar artery lumen areas and arterial wall thickness were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histological sections of the CA1 and CA3 regions and dentate gyri of the hippocampi were evaluated semiquantitatively for neural tissue degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the SAH group, the mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional area of the basilar artery was reduced by 62% after SAH as compared with the non-SAH controls (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After SAH, the vasospastic response was attenuated by 36% in animals treated with 20 mg/kg of LTG compared with the SAH group (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional areas of the basilar artery were 279000 +/- 27000 microm(2) in the control group, 173000 +/- 17600 microm(2) in the SAH group, and 236000 +/- 10000 microm(2) in the SAH + LTG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences between the SAH group and the LTG-treated group were statistically significant (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological examination was done in 12 control, 12 SAH, and 9 SAH + LTG-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean degeneration score for the control group and SAH + LTG group was statistically significant (P = .012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference between the SAH group and SAH+ LTG group was also statistically significant (P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that oral administration of LTG has marked neuroprotective effect and significantly attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH, thus providing additional support for the role of non-L-type calcium channels and voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
