<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>Blister</z:mp>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the internal carotid artery (ICA) are very fragile, thin-walled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lesions are susceptible to premature rupture intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe two cases of successful arterial suturing of these <z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>blister</z:mp>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ICA, followed by a clip reinforcement technique and circumferential wrapping with a silastic sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two young men presented with a diffuse and dense <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in the basal cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial angiogram obtained soon after the SAH showed a broad-based, small bulging appearance of the dorsal wall of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, a very thin-walled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was identified on the C2 and C1 segment of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> ruptured abruptly during surgical manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After application of temporary clips, an aneurysmal tear of the ICA was repaired with 8-0 nylon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To prevent the regrowth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, clip reinforcement, by circumferential wrapping with a transparent <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> sheet, was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postoperative clinical course was uneventful, although one patient showed transient right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographic studies performed postoperatively showed complete obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as well as a patent ICA lumen in one case and total occlusion of the ICA in the other case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both patients were discharged with no neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This technique can be a useful treatment option for these fragile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in cases where other options, such as direct clips or encircling clips, may be impossible </plain></SENT>
