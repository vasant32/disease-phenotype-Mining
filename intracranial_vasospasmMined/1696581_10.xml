<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two days after blood injection, the time point at which maximum vasoconstriction is occurring in this model, immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay showed a reduction in SP- and CGRP-like immunoreactivity (LI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The quantitative measurements revealed a significant 50% reduction of CGRP-LI and a slight reduction of SP-LI in SAH as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This partial reduction in neurotransmitter content (denervation) caused no change in the sensitivity of the rat basilar artery to SP or CGRP as studied using a sensitive in vitro method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the maximum relaxant response to CGRP was increased from 52 to 81% (p less than 0.05), while there was no change in the maximum SP-induced relaxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that not only a pre-, but also a postsynaptic modulation of perivascular sensory fibers may occur in experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
