<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We quantitatively measured the levels of expression of genes related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the spastic artery in a canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty dogs were assigned to 4 groups: group D0, control; group D2, dogs killed 2 days after cisternal injection of blood; group D7, dogs given double cisternal injections of blood and killed 7 days after the first injection; and group D14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed twice: on the first day and before the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, E-secretin, fibronectin, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, transforming growth factor-ss, basic fibroblast growth factor, and collagen types I, III, and IV were examined with TaqMan real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prolonged arterial narrowing peaking on 7 day was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in vessel caliber between D0, D2, D7, and D14 groups (P:&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the basilar artery for IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, ICAM-1, and collagen type I between D0, D2, D7, and D14 groups (P:=0.0079, 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>0196, 0.0040, 0.0017, and &lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was highest in D7 for IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and ICAM-1 (17-, 16-, 131-, and 1.7-fold compared with those of D0, respectively) and in D14 for collagen type I (10.9-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of genes related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the spastic artery suggests that inflammatory reaction of the cerebral artery is associated with sustained contraction </plain></SENT>
