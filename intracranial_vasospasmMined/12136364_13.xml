<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 11 patients admitted with a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the anterior circulation and suspected of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial vasospasm</z:e> on clinical examination and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trace images and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> maps were interpreted by two examiners and compared with clinical and imaging follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PWI revealed an area of slowed flow in seven patients, including four with major and three with minor hypoperfusion on SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two patients, PWI did not demonstrate any abnormality, while SPECT revealed major hypoperfusion in one and a minor deficit hypoperfusion in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients with high signal on DWI had a permanent neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
