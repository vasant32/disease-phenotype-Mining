<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the efficacy of the orally active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin-receptor-antagonist</z:chebi> RO 47-0203 for prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), using the canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the preventive study 28 beagle dogs were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen animals each were assigned to the treatment and to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group each dog received two single doses of 30 mg/kg RO 47-0203 orally per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery decreased from 1.36 +/- 0.17 mm at day one to 1.19 +/- 0.23 mm at day eight in the treatment group while in the control group the vessel diameter decreased from 1.48 +/- 0.19 mm at day one to 1.02 +/- 0.22 mm at day eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results corresponded to a decrease of vessel diameter of 13.1% +/- 11.2% in the treatment group and a decrease of vessel diameter of 30,7 +/- 12,4% in the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the therapeutic study the intraarterial infusion of 15.0 mg/kg RO 47-0203, at day 8 after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, caused no significant increase of the vessel diameter after 10 min., 20 min. or 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results underline the important role of endothelin in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and give for the first time evidence that prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can be achieved by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin-receptor-antagonist</z:chebi> RO 47-0203 </plain></SENT>
