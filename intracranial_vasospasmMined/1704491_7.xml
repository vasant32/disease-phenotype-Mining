<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Oxy-Hb with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> suppressed the ability of Oxy-Hb to contract the arteries, especially in the monkey arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability of intracisternally applied Oxy-Hb to constrict the basilar artery in anesthetized dogs was diminished when Oxy-Hb was treated previously with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> (AsA-Hb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contraction caused by Oxy-Hb was suppressed by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> and aspirin in isolated bovine cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent relaxations elicited by substance P and relaxations induced by stimulation of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> nerves with <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> were suppressed by treatment with Oxy-Hb and AsA-Hb; however, the inhibitory effect of AsA-Hb was markedly less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxy-Hb attenuated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>-induced relaxations in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas AsA-Hb in concentrations up to 1.6 x 10(-5) M did not significantly influence the relaxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that incubation of Oxy-Hb with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> alters markedly the biological activity of Oxy-Hb; the vasoconstrictor activity is suppressed, and the ability to diminish <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> actions is minimized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a rationale for the use of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> in cisternal irrigation to prevent the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
