<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was defined when the bicaudate index was greater than the 95th percentile for age on a computed tomographic scan within 72 hours of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty (24%) patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality in this study was 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 141 surviving patients, 20 (14%) patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt replacement secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that the following factors were significantly related to the need of VP shunting: increasing age, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, preoperative CSF diversion, low admission Hunt and Hess grades, and poor Fisher's SAH grades </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was combined with high mortality (28%) at our follow-up review </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend that patients with aneurysmal SAH should be followed up at least 6 months after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, especially in those patients with high risks of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
