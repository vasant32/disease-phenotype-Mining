<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) perfusion is a recently developed modality for the evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of using CT perfusion to detect vasospasm in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients between the ages of 41 and 66 years with aneurysmal SAH underwent 23 CT perfusion scans for suspected vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent DS angiography within 12 hours of the CT perfusion scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of vasospasm on CT perfusion images was determined based on qualitative reading using color maps of mean transit time, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume as criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of vasospasm as retrospectively determined using CT perfusion was compared with DS angiography findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 CT perfusion scans performed, 21 (91%) were concordant with angiography findings in predicting the presence or absence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 15 of 23 scans, the presence of vasospasm was detected on CT perfusion scans and confirmed on DS angiography studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two cases, vasospasm was revealed on DS angiography but was not confirmed on CT perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The degree of agreement between CT perfusion and DS angiography for detection of vasospasm was high (K = 0.8, p , 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography perfusion is an accurate, reliable, and noninvasive method to detect the presence or absence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It can be used as a tool to help guide the decision to pursue DS angiography with the intent to treat vasospasm </plain></SENT>
