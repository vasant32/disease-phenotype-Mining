<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: within the last decades several clinical trials were performed to analyze the effectiveness of cisternal and ventricular lavage on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the present analysis was to review and summarize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> documented clinical studies using cisternal or ventricular lavage to prevent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: the MEDLINE Web site ( www.pub.med.com ) was searched using the clinical query function optimized for clinical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Search terms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, vasospasm, cisternal and ventricular lavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were divided into cisternal and ventricular lavage therapies alone and its combination with additional treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: so far the literature search revealed a total of nine clinical trials using cisternal or ventricular lavage alone in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated using urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A metaanalysis, investigating a total of 652 included patients revealed a significant reduction of delayed neurological deficits, a significant increase of outcome and a significant decrease of mortality in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional there was no difference of effectiveness or side effects using urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, only one of these studies was based on a prospective, randomized study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A combination of cisternal or ventricular lavage with some sort of kinetic treatment was documented in a total of three studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were designed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combined application demonstrated reduced delayed neurological deficits, reduced vasospasm and better outcome in two studies for the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One study was stopped early due to unexpected complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: In conclusion, there is strong evidence that cisternal or ventricular lavage alone and in combination with kinetic therapy lead to a reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and better outcome in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As a consequence a prospective randomized study would be of great interest </plain></SENT>
