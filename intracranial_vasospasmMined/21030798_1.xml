<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 187 patients with SAH, 67 admitted before the introduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment in May 1999 (early cases) and 120 treated thereafter (late cases), were transported to the National Cardiovascular Center and treated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase between November 1997 and September 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment was performed in 19 patients of the 120 late cases, 10 males and 9 females aged 33-72 years (mean 57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>6 years), treated by direct surgery in 15 and endovascular surgery in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment were age of 75 years or younger, SAH due to rupture of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>, Japan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of 100 or higher, and initiation of treatment within 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The body core temperature was sustained at 34Â°C for 48 hours, rewarming was performed over 48 hours, and normothermia was maintained thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome, evaluated according to the modified Rankin scale (m-RS) on transfer to another hospital or after 3 months, was m-RS 3 in 1 patient, m-RS 4 in 4, m-RS 5 in 3, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before the introduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment (early period), 16 patients showed the indications for the treatment, and their outcomes were m-RS 3 in 2, m-RS 4 in 3, m-RS 5 in 2, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was important as a prognostic factor, markedly deteriorating the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Hyperthermia</z:hpo> after therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and markedly affecting the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment did not improve the outcome of severe SAH compared with the period before its introduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The emphasis in treating severe SAH should be placed on the maintenance of normothermia to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and elimination of factors that may induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, rather than interventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for aggressive brain protection </plain></SENT>
