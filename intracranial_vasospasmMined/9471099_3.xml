<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of erythrocyte lysate-induced [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i mobilization is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the action of erythrocyte lysate on [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i mobilization by monitoring [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and the Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels (KCa) in freshly isolated rat basilar artery smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i imaging study, erythrocyte lysate produced a biphasic response, a transient peak and a prolonged plateau [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the absence of external <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, erythrocyte lysate induced only a transient peak [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i response without a marked plateau phase, indicating the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> released from internal stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte lysate-induced plateau [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i response was resistant to nicardipine, a voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel blocker, but was abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevation of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i induced by erythrocyte lysate contracted smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the electrophysiological study, elevation of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i by erythrocyte lysate increased KCa currents in whole-cell patch-clamp configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect of erythrocyte lysate on KCa was blocked by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that erythrocyte lysate releases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>-sensitive intracellular stores and produces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> entry from voltage-independent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> pathways </plain></SENT>
