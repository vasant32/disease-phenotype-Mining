<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Endovascular treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> consists primarily of transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA) and intra-arterial (IA) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> administration, the former restricted to use within the distal internal carotid and proximal intracerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to characterize clinical and angiographic features of those patients undergoing TBA and IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> treatments, particularly as it related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted for aneurysmal SAH undergoing IA treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (n=73) examining clinical and angiographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous and ordinal means were examined with Mann-Whitney and Student t tests while nominal values were examined with Ï‡(2)/Fisher's exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic and linear regression included admission Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale, age, number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and number of vasospastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Those patients receiving IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> in isolation (n=16) were older (45.9 vs 59.1 years, p=0.001) and more frequently had vasospasm involving the anterior cerebral artery alone (0.0% vs 31.3%, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of an IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> alone or in combination with TBA more frequently occurred in the coiled population (32.3% vs 50.1%, p=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TBA and IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> are safe and effective means to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their use for proximal and distal vasospasm, respectively, and in tandem for diffuse disease, suggests regional differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> between surgical clipping and endovascular coiling populations with coiled patients more often having distal vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Craniotomy and/or hemorrhagic evacuation performed during open surgery may contribute to this difference </plain></SENT>
