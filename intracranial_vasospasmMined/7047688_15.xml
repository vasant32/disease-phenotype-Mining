<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prostacyclin (10(-10) to 10(-6)M) caused a dose-related reversal of contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG)F2 alpha, and U-46619 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane-A2</z:chebi> mimetic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These agents were tested at concentrations or volumes that produced almost maximum or maximum responses and those that produced approximately 50% of the maximum response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contractions induced by maximum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> and U-46619 were least affected by prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane-A2</z:chebi> generated from guinea-pig lung were reversed in a dose-dependent fashion by prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This ability of prostacyclin to physiologically antagonize contractions of the human basilar artery in vitro induced by high concentrations of various spasmogenic agents suggests that such a potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35620">vasodilator agent</z:chebi> or more stable analogue may be of value in the treatment of such disorders as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
