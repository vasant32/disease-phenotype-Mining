<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the preventive effect of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on development of vasospasm and its mechanism in a rat femoral artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rat femoral artery model for vasospasm was used in this investigation (n = 108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The femoral arteries were divided into four groups: empty and no irradiation (control), UV irradiation (UV group), blood placement (VS group), and blood placement after UV irradiation (VS + UV group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> area was measured, and smooth muscle cell counts in the medial layer of the vessel wall were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical study was performed with cross sections of fixed femoral arteries at 12 hours and 1, 3, 5, 7, and 49 days after blood placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rings of femoral arteries on Day 7 were subjected to pharmacological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with UV irradiation (VS + UV group) resulted not only in significant inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm but also in a significant decrease in smooth muscle cells compared with the VS group on Days 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The UV-treated arteries (UV and VS + UV groups) exhibited a significant number of Bax- and Bcl-2-positive cells on Days 5 and 7, but few CPP-32 positive cells were observed at the same time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the pharmacological study, contractile response to KCI or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> was reduced significantly in the UV-treated arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results imply that UV irradiation prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm and suggest that UV-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> plays an important role in the preventive effect without causing complications during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
