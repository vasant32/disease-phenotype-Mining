<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated whether Hb can in vitro regulate PKC expression in endothelial as opposed to smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of expression of PKCalpha and PKCzeta were quantitatively determined by means of computer-assisted fluorescence microscopy in the A7r5 smooth-muscle rat cells and human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) </plain></SENT>
