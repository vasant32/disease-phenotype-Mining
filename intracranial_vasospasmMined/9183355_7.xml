<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the effects of in vivo transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA) on the structure and function of the arterial wall, a canine model of hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> of the high cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This model was also used to determine whether TBA performed before clot placement could prevent the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve dogs underwent surgical exposure of both distal-cervical ICAs, followed by baseline angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One randomly selected ICA in each dog was then subjected to in vivo TBA and repeated angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both distal ICAs were then surrounded with blood clots held by <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> elastomer sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days later angiography was repeated, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ICAs in four animals were perfusion-fixed in situ for morphological analysis by electron microscopy, and the arteries in the remaining eight animals were removed and immediately immersed in oxygenated Krebs' solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contractile responses of isolated arterial rings from each ICA were recorded after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, while relaxations in response to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 and papaverine were recorded after tonic contraction to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> had been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and pharmacological responses of ICAs that had been exposed to blood with or without prior TBA were compared with data obtained from control arterial segments of intact, more proximal regions of the ICAs from each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TBA resulted in immediate angiographic enlargement of the ICA lumen that was still evident 7 days later despite the placement of clotted blood around the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Scanning and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated flattening of the intima and internal elastic lamina in these dilated arteries, associated with patchy losses of endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ICAs that had been exposed to clotted blood but had not undergone prior TBA developed consistent angiographic and morphological vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In comparison with control vessels and nondilated vasospastic vessels, vessels dilated with TBA and then exposed to clotted blood showed significantly diminished responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compounds tested, with the exception of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in vivo TBA results in a degree of functional impairment of vascular smooth muscle that persists for at least 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with previous observations of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of TBA in isolated arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> smooth muscle function is required for the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Finally, these results indicate that TBA performed before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm prevents its development </plain></SENT>
