<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular processes of continuous vasospasm of cerebral arteries after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> differential display and screening of cDNA expression array were performed to identify genes that are differentially expressed in vasospastic arteries of canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of 18 genes were found to be upregulated, and those of two genes to be downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 12 represent known genes or homologues of genes characterized previously, and the other eight genes are not related to any sequences in the databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The known genes include five upregulated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related genes encoding monocyte chemotactic protein-1, cystatin B, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family heavy chain-related protein, serum amyloid A protein, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 130, suggesting that inflammatory reaction may be involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The upregulation of three known genes encoding stress-related proteins of vascular endothelial growth factor, BiP protein, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth-arrest</z:mpath> and DNA-damage-inducible protein may be involved in possible cell survival in the damaged arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A full-length cDNA for the unknown clone DVS 27, whose expression was most highly upregulated, was isolated from the cerebral artery cDNA library by hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characterization of these genes should help to clarify the molecular mechanism of continuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
