<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased intraluminal pressure elicits vasoconstriction, whereas decreased intraluminal pressure induces vasodilatation, thereby maintaining flow constant over the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiologic blood pressure range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the myogenic response is crucial to identify deficiencies with pathologic consequences, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and to identify potential therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three mechanisms have been suggested to be involved in the myogenic response: (1) membrane depolarization, which induces Ca(2+) entry, activation of myosin light chain kinase, phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chains (LC(20)), increased actomyosin MgATPase activity, cross-bridge cycling, and vasoconstriction; (2) activation of the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway, leading to inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase by phosphorylation of MYPT1, the myosin targeting regulatory subunit of the phosphatase, and increased LC(20) phosphorylation; and (3) activation of the ROCK and protein kinase C pathways, leading to actin polymerization and the formation of enhanced connections between the actin cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and extracellular matrix to augment force transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review describes these three mechanisms, emphasizing recent developments regarding the importance of dynamic actin polymerization in the myogenic response of the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
