<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dendroaspis natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53018">DNP</z:chebi>), derived from the venom of Dendroaspis augusticeps, the Green Mamba snake, has recently been discovered in human plasma and atrial myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no information regarding the presence or putative role of this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sensitive and specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53018">DNP</z:chebi> radioimmunoassay was performed on venous blood samples obtained on post-SAH Days 1, 3, and 7 from 10 consecutive SAH patients (cases) and randomly from 9 healthy volunteers (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory data, including daily serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration and fluid balance, were collected prospectively up to 7 days after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53018">DNP</z:chebi> levels occurred in five (63%) of eight patients who had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53018">DNP</z:chebi> levels measured on Days 1 and 3 (mean increase, 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53018">DNP</z:chebi> level was significantly associated with development of a negative fluid balance (P = 0.003) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three (75%) of the four patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> during this study experienced an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53018">DNP</z:chebi> levels from Days 1 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to find a significant association between elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53018">DNP</z:chebi>, a new member of the natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> family, and the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> in patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings warrant further investigation by means of a large-scale, prospective, case-control study </plain></SENT>
