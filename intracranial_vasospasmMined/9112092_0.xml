<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of SAH and both treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>) and sympathectomy on endothelium-dependent vasodilation and ET-1-induced vasoconstriction of isolated rabbit carotid artery was examined using an isometric tension recording method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five rabbits were divided into four groups: control animals, 7 days after SAH, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> after SAH for 7 days and sympathectomy after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) was used to evoke concentration-dependent vasodilation of isolated arterial rings previously contracted by 10(-6) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the animals killed 7 days after SAH, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced relaxation was suppressed and the degree of relaxation of this group was 50% of the initial contractile tone in response to the 10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These relaxant responses did not return to control values in carotid arteries obtained from animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> and subjected to sympathectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In isolated carotid arteries, ET-1 (10(-10) to 10(-8) M) produced concentration-dependent contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These contractile responses were significantly enhanced in animals 7 days after SAH compared with controls and did not return to control values in carotid arteries obtained from animals both treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> and sympathectomized for 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present experiments suggest that impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and the hyperreactivity of ET-1 of the carotid artery as well as cerebral arteries may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> and sympathectomy during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage for vasospasm after SAH did not affect these vascular responses of the extradural part of the carotid artery to ET-1 and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
