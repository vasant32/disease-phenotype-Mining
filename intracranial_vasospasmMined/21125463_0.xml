<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) is a devastating sequela of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the many factors that are associated with the pathogenesis of CVS, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and underlying haemodynamics play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we present an integrated clinical-engineering approach to CVS research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: after an admission CT scan, CT angiography (CTA) and/or Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) scans are performed for SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of cerebral vasculature and its geometric parameters are monitored and compared with follow-up CTA and/or DSA scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The governing equations for blood flow are numerically solved for the arteries and the computational results are analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: in the particular CVS case presented in this paper, the numerical results indicate that blood flow velocity increases in moderate and severely spastic vessels (A1, M1 segment) that perfuse brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, decreased vessel diameters in A1 and M1 arteries create larger resistance to CBF and hence lead to reduced flow in the inner carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: a numerical approach to patient-specific CVS analysis has been established, and some initial results are achieved via application to an actual spasm case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The undergoing and future work include applying the approach to more CVS cases and incorporating computational models of different scales into the current framework for CVS and SAH research </plain></SENT>
