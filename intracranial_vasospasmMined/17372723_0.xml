<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the effect of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane-A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>) and 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi>) by human blood platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF was drawn by lumbar puncture from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy volunteers (n = 17) and samples judged to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after routine examination in the clinical laboratories and were used fresh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that CSF inhibited the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> by blood platelets incubated with C14 labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) in a concentration-related manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further biochemical analysis using proteolytic enzymes, gel filtration and membrane partition chromatography showed that the inhibitory activity was peptidic in nature and associated with a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of low molecular weight (1,400 Da) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to demonstrate that human CSF contains a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase enzymes in CSF </plain></SENT>
