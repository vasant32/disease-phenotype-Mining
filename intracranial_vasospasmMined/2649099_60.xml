<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ET (10(-11) - 3 x 10(-8) M) induced a concentration-dependent contraction in isolated canine basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal injection of 10 to 1,000 pmol ET into dogs induced a dose-dependent decrease in the basilar artery diameter, as measured angiographically on the 1st day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the 3rd day after the injection of ET (10 pmol), the diameter of the basilar artery had diminished to 76% of the value seen in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no effects on blood pressure or heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, ET seems to be a potent constrictor of cerebral arteries in vivo, and these effects are long-lasting </plain></SENT>
