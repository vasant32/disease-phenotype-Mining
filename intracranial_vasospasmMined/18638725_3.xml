<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between July 1992 and January 1993 a prospective pilot study of the efficacy of intra-arterial papaverine in the management of clinically significant angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> arising as a consequence of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this period 40 patients were managed with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with nimodipine from day of admission and carefully monitored in the neurosurgical intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>11 of the 40 patients subsequently developed clinically significant angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and underwent angiography with selective internal carotid or vertebral artery injection of papaverine in 12 to 40 mg boluses to a maximum of 450 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A good angiographic response was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent repeat procedures, in one case twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall clinical outcome was good in 7 cases, moderate disability in 2 cases, severe disability in 1 case and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients who underwent the procedure in less than 4 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their deficits (n=8) a good outcome was seen to occur in 7 patients with one patient sustaining a moderate deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications from the procedure were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in 3 patients and a momentary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in-syndrome</z:e> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> complications were seen with a fast bolus of the higher volume papaverine and have not occurred with a slow infusion of the lower dose boluses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developing these complications had them recur outside the angiogram suite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is that this form of treatment supplements the therapeutic regimens now available in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
