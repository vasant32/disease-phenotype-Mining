<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty cynomolgus monkeys were divided by restricted randomization into 2 treatment groups of 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five animals from each treatment group were randomized into subgroups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals of subgroup 1 were studied pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain biopsies of the animals in subgroup 2 were performed and studied with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 20 animals supplemented the number studied angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant VSP (P less than 0.05) was detected in the majority of vessels from the clot site (right) of both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy results showed positive correlation with the angiographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When comparing the effects of U74006F to those of the placebo at day 7, there was a significant difference (P less than 0.05) in the degree of VSP in the right extradural internal carotid and right middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This resulted from a greater degree of VSP in placebo animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two animals developed delayed ischemic deficits, one from each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of the U74006F animal was smaller than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the placebo animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although overall changes in phosphagen levels did not reach statistical significance, HPLC analysis of the cortical biopsies did show a decrease in the ATP/<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> +/- <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> ratio of 54% in placebo animals and only 7% in animals receiving U74006F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral arteries of 2 animals were also studied with HPLC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
