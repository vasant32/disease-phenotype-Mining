<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with fresh blood or mixtures incubated for over 15 days, the severity of induced vasoconstriction is slight and duration short </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mixtures incubated 5 to 10 days induced severe and prolonged vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This incubation period for blood and CSF mixtures inducing severe vasospasm coincides with the developmental period of vasospasm after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in our clinical experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prolongation of severe vasoconstriction induced by mixtures incubated for 7 days with clotted components is definitely greater than one induced by a mixture without clotted components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This experimental study suggests the existence of a vasospasmogenic substance in the blood in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activity begins about 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, increases strongly at 5 to 10 days, and disappears after 15 days </plain></SENT>
