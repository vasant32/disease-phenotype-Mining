<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was to delineate the therapeutic efficacy and potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> (AG), a relatively selective inhibitor of iNOS activity, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH was induced by a single injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna of adult male rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intravenous bolus injection of AG (150 mg/kg) was administrated 1h after SAH, and this dosage was repeated on the following day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was verified by computed tomography angiography (CTA) day 2 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rabbit basilar arteries were harvested for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemical examination, RT-PCR, and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CTA data revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> of SAH rabbits was significantly prevented via AG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TEM results demonstrated the ultrastructural morphological changes of endothelial cells of SAH rabbits were ameliorated by AG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel, AG treatment increased eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels along with the reduced immunoreactivity of nitrotyrosine in rabbit basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our discovery suggested AG inhibition of iNOS activity could significantly reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH via restoration of dysfunctional endothelial cells by the upregulation of eNOS, indicating a regulatory cross-talk between eNOS and iNOS in the pathogenesis of SAH </plain></SENT>
