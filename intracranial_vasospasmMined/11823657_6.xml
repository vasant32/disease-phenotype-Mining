<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have recently reported the safety of intraventricular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> from vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatments have been accompanied previously by cerebral angiography to gauge treatment effect on established vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We presently report the safe coadministration of intraventricular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16094">thiosulfate</z:chebi> in 10 patients with secured ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> in the intensive care unit, without the use of cerebral angiography for vasospasm treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were considered eligible for treatment on the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> grade or manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by either transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) or neurological examination criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The route of administration was intraventricular, by way of ventriculostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two separate protocols differing in dosage frequency were used, depending on the presence or absence of a new neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment was measured by TCD and neurological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Good outcome was observed in 7 of 8 vasospasm patients presenting with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> grade &gt; or =3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients demonstrated reversal of well-defined neurological deficits (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo>) in the setting of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients demonstrated a decrease in TCD velocities within 1 hour of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died: 1 from intractable vasospasm despite maximal medical management and angioplasty and 1 from pulmonary causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> occurred in the setting of a high dose of medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This responded promptly to medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prolonged intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> did not occur; modest elevations of both intracranial pressure and mean arterial blood pressure were observed when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> were associated with treatment, which occurred commonly in awake subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16094">thiosulfate</z:chebi> may be safely administered in the intensive care unit setting without the requirement of cerebral angiography to guide the effects of therapy </plain></SENT>
