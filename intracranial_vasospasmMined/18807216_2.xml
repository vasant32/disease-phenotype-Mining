<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is a serious complication resulting in delayed neurological deficit, increased morbidity, mortality, longer hospital stays, and rehabilitation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It afflicts approximately 35 per 100,000 Americans per year, and there is currently no effective therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present in vitro data suggesting that increasing intrinsic nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> relaxation pathways in vascular smooth muscle via dopaminergic agonism ameliorates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH (CSF(V)) was used to induce vasospasm in porcine carotid artery in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> was added to test its ability to reverse spasm, and specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48561">dopamine receptor antagonists</z:chebi> were used to determine which receptor mediated the protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical techniques confirmed the presence of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptor subtypes and the involvement of NOS in the mechanism of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> receptor 1, 2, and 3 subtypes are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> present in porcine carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> significantly reversed spasm in vitro (67% relaxation), and this relaxation was prevented by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">Haloperidol</z:chebi>, a D(2)R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (10% relaxation, P &lt; 0.05), but not by D(1) or D(3)-receptor antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both eNOS and iNOS expression were increased significantly in response to CSF(V) alone, and this was significantly enhanced by addition of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, and blocked by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">Haloperidol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is significantly reversed in a functional measure of vasospasm in vitro by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, via a D(2)R-mediated pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in NOS protein seen in both the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle in response to CSF(V) is enhanced by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, also in a D(2)R-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
