<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examines whether platelet-activating factor (PAF) is involved in the occurrence of vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A vasospasm model was produced in rabbits, with animals in six experimental groups receiving two subarachnoid injections of autologous arterial blood with the addition of one of the following; saline (Control Group 1), 25% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (Control Group 2), PAF (1, 2.5, 5, or 10 micrograms), CV6209 (10 or 100 micrograms), BN52021 (10 or 100 micrograms), or anti-PAF immunoglobulin G (IgG, 50 or 500 micrograms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were detected between Control Groups 1 and 2 with regard to neurological deterioration and basilar artery constriction after SAH was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of PAF together with autologous blood aggravated neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner (r = 0.724, p &lt; 0.001) and produced basilar artery constriction at two doses each of 2.5 micrograms (p &lt; 0.05), 5 micrograms (p &lt; 0.01), and 10 micrograms (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deterioration was prevented in rabbits receiving an intracisternal administration of either PAF <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CV6209 or BN52021 or anti-PAF IgG (p &lt; 0.01 at a total dose of 20 micrograms and p &lt; 0.05 at a total dose of 200 micrograms CV6209, p &lt; 0.01 at total doses of 20 and 200 micrograms BN52021, and p &lt; 0.01 at total doses of 100 and 1000 micrograms anti-PAF IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reduction in basilar artery constriction was achieved by the injection of anti-PAF IgG (p &lt; 0.05 at total doses of 100 and 1000 micrograms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological examination at autopsy on Days 14 to 21 showed mainly ischemic changes in the brain, including selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control and PAF groups showed marked ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, no ischemic changes were noted in the anti-PAF IgG group, and only 9% of animals in the CV6209 group and 25% in the BN52021 group demonstrated selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study thus provides evidence to support the role of PAF in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
