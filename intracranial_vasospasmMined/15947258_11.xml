<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SP600125 a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined if SP600125 could reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven dogs were assigned to 5 groups: control, SAH, SAH plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO), SAH plus SP600125 (10 micromol/L), and SAH plus SP600125 (30 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by the injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna on day 0 and day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were evaluated on day 0 and day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The behavior of the dogs was evaluated daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activation of the JNK pathway, the infiltration of leukocytes, and the production of cytokines were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe vasospasm was observed in the basilar artery of SAH and DMSO dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The JNK signaling pathway was activated in the basilar artery after SAH and SP600125 reduced angiographic and morphological vasospasm and improved behavior scores with a concomitant reduction of infiltrated leukocytes and IL-6 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that SP600125 attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> through a suppressed <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, which may provide a novel therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
