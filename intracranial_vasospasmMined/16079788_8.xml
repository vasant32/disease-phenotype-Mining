<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Membrane potential controls the contractile state of arterial myocytes by gating voltage-sensitive calcium channels and is in turn primarily controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> ion conductance through several classes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We characterized the role of inwardly rectifying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (K(IR)) channels in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was created in dogs using the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological, real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and isometric tension techniques were used to characterize the expression and function of K(IR) channels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and vasospastic basilar artery 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> resulted in severe vasospasm of the basilar artery (mean of 61% +/- 5% reduction in diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Membrane potential of pressurized vasospastic basilar arteries was significantly depolarized compared with control arteries (-46 +/- 1.4 mV versus -29.8 +/- 1.8 mV, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In whole-cell patch clamp of enzymatically isolated basilar artery myocytes, average K(IR) conductance was 1.6 +/- 0.5 pS/pF in control cells and 9.2 +/- 2.2 pS/pF in SAH cells (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blocking K(IR) channels with BaCl(2) (0.1 mmol/L) resulted in significantly greater membrane depolarization in vasospastic compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of K(IR) 2.1 messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) was increased after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunohistochemistry also showed increased expression of K(IR) protein in vasospastic smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blockage of K(IR) channels in arteries under isometric tension produced a greater contraction in SAH than in control arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results document increased expression of K(IR) 2.1 mRNA and protein during vasospasm after experimental SAH and suggest that this increase is a functionally significant adaptive response acting to reduce vasospasm </plain></SENT>
