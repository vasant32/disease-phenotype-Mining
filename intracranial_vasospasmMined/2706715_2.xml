<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During anaesthesia for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery, we prospectively compared haemodynamic values obtained from 13 patients being treated with nicardipine HCl (0.15 mg.kg-1.hr-1 IV) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> against values obtained from 11 untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior to induction of anaesthesia, nicardipine-treated patients had significantly elevated mean +/- SD cardiac index (5.67 +/- 1.30 vs 3.99 +/- 0.73 L.min-1.m-2) while MAP (86 +/- 10 vs 99 +/- 14 mmHg) and systemic vascular resistance (647 +/- 227 vs 1141 +/- 404 dynes.<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>-1.cm-5) were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heart rate, CVP, and PACWP were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anaesthesia induction and tracheal intubation resulted in similar haemodynamic values between groups with the exception of CVP (10 +/- 5 vs 5 +/- 2 mmHg) and PACWP (15 +/- 5 vs 8 +/- 3 mmHg) which were elevated in the nicardipine group (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine-treated patients required more intravenous fluids during the operative procedure (2.4 +/- 0.3 L vs 1.5 +/- 0.4 L, P less than 0.05) and were less likely to require <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> supplementation to <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>/nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> anaesthesia (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, our experience with nicardipine HCl revealed no major untoward effects with respect to maintenance of intraoperative haemodynamic stability despite continuous antivasospasm therapy with this <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
