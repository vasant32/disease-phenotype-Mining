<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ET-1 levels and angiographic vasospasm and DCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with aSAH were consented (n = 106) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was determined by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DCI was determined by transcranial Doppler (TCD) results and/or angiogram results with corresponding clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF ET-1 levels over 14 days after the initial insult was quantified by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET-1 analysis included a group-based trajectory analysis and ET-1 exposure rate during 24, 48, and 72 h prior to, as well as 72 h post angiography, or clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Trajectory analysis revealed two distinct groups of subjects with 56% of patients in the low ET-1 trajectory group (mean at day 1 = 0.31 pg/ml; SE = 0.04; mean at day 14 = 0.41 pg/ml; SE = 0.15) and 44% of patients in the high ET-1 trajectory group (mean at day 1 = 0.65 pg/ml; SE = 0.08; mean at day 14 = 0.61 pg/ml; SE = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed that ET-1 exposure rate 72 h before angiography and clinical spasm was a significant predictor of both angiographic vasospasm and DCI, whereas, ET-1 exposure after angiography and clinical spasm was not associated with either angiographic vasospasm or DCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on these results we conclude that ET-1 concentrations are elevated in a sub-group of patients and that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (72 h prior to angiography and clinical neurological deterioration), but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, elevations in CSF ET-1 concentrations are indicative of the pathogenic alterations of vasospasm and DCI in aSAH patients </plain></SENT>
