<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have examined nicardipine for the treatment of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), but have shown inconsistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the clinical effectiveness of nicardipine in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients who had suffered from aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched for the controlled trials evaluating nicardipine for treating SAH after a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, without language restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a manual search of the bibliographies of relevant articles was also conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two researchers of the present study independently performed the literature search and the data extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The meta-analyses were performed using the software RevMan 4.2.10 (provided by the Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) </plain></SENT>
