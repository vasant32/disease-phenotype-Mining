<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study investigated the ability of NAC to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one, male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 rabbits each: group 1 (control), group 2 (SAH only), group 3 (SAH + NAC treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NAC (150 mg/kg, single dose, IP) was administered just before SAH and continued until 72 hours after SAH in group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 72 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, SOD, and GSH-Px activities were measured, and basilar artery cross-sectional areas, arterial wall thickness, and endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a cross section of basillary artery were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraperitoneal administration of NAC was found to be markedly effective against developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following a SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It could significantly reduce elevated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and increase the level of tissue GSH-Px and SOD enzymatic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, NAC treatment was found to be effective in increasing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area and reducing wall thickness of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of arteries in the NAC treatment group was well protected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NAC markedly reduced apoptotic index and protects the endothelial integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates, for the first time, that NAC treatment attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rabbit SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NAC treatment has significant neuroprotective effect and markedly prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the NAC treatment might be beneficial in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH, thus showing potential for clinical implications </plain></SENT>
