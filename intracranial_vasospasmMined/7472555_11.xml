<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possible role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> in modifying vascular function was examined in the present study by testing its effects on nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) activity in cultured rat aortic smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity was estimated from the amounts of accumulated <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate, which are oxidative products of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">Hemin</z:chebi> (1-100 microM) increased the levels of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate in culture medium in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi>-induced elevation of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate was inhibited significantly by the NOS inhibitor, N omega-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (300 microM), and by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (5 micrograms/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> is capable of stimulating the expression of an inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS) in vascular smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional expression of iNOS is known to cause injurious effects on the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by generating extremely high levels of NO </plain></SENT>
