<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bencianol caused a dose-related (1-100 micrograms ml-1) reversal of contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, and U-46619 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane-A2</z:chebi> mimetic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bencianol was more effective against contractions induced by EC50 compared to maximal concentrations of each agent, and was least effective against the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane-A2</z:chebi> mimetic, U-46619 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane-A2</z:chebi>-like substances generated from guinea-pig lungs were also reversed by bencianol but only at the highest concentration used (100 micrograms ml-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relevance of this action of bencianol to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> is discussed </plain></SENT>
