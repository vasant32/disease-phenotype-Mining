<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of these reactions is thought to be one of the therapeutic strategies for prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of Ebselen, a synthetic seleno-organic compound, which exhibits anti-oxidation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidaselike activity to inhibit free radical reactions by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a primate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen monkeys were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAH was produced by introduction of a blood clot around the right middle cerebral artery and the right side of the circle of Willis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monkeys were randomly divided into three groups according to Ebselen dosage: 1) no dosage or non-treated group; 2) high-dose Ebselen group; and 3) low-dose Ebselen group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The drug was administered at 10 mg/Kg in the high-dose group and 5 mg/Kg in the low-dose group twice a day in each group for 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vessel diameter was evaluated on angiograms before the induction of SAH and at Day 7 following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:In the untreated group, the angiograms showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) reductions of the mean vessel caliber of the right internal carotid (ICA) (38 +/- 10% reduction) and the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) (56 +/- 9.7%) compared with the baseline value before SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the high-dose Ebselen-treated group, the mean percent reduction in vessel caliber of the right ICA (16 +/- 11%) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (28 +/- 9.5%) on Day 7 angiograms were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than those in the nontreated group, whereas the mean percent reduction of these vessels in the low-dose Ebselen-treated group showed no significant difference compared with the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was inhibited in the animals in which a relatively large amount of Ebselen was administered for 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the oxidation or free radical reaction by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation after SAH might be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm, and that inhibition of these reactions by drugs, such as Ebselen, may have a promising effect for prevention of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
