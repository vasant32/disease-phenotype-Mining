<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The vasodilatory effect of intra-cisternal infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> solution was evaluated in 10 patients with symptomatic vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) who underwent early clipping surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cisternal drainage was installed in the prepontine and/or sylvian fissures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography was performed immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic vasospasm, then intra-cisternal infusion of 15 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> in Ringer solution was started at 20 ml/hr and continued until day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Irrigation was performed from the cisternal tube (inlet) to the spinal drainage (outlet) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebrospinal fluid <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> ion concentration (1.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/l) significantly increased after the infusion therapy (6.0 +/- 1.7 mEq/l, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiography showed vasodilatory effect on the spastic cerebral arteries at 3 hours after the infusion, especially in the arteries near to the site of cisternal drainage placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion also caused decreased mean arterial blood velocity in the spastic arteries in 6 of the 7 measured patients (162 +/- 38 cm/sec to 114 +/- 42 cm/sec, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, 5 of the 10 patients achieved good recovery, 1 patient had moderate disability, 1 patient became severely disabled due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, and 3 patients were vegetative or dead, due to failure of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> irrigation in 1 patient and advanced age in the other 2 (more than 80 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study indicates that intra-cisternal infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> solution has vasodilatory effect on the spastic cerebral arteries after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
