<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> increases the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients undergoing intracranial aneurysmal surgery without preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> group (group A, n = 15) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> maintained anesthesia group (group B, n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients in the group A were performed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> after dura opening by increasing the inhaled concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> to decrease the mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 30 - 40 percent of that of baseline value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was clipped, the concentration of inhaled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> was decreased so as to stop blood pressure reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient in group B was given 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> during the whole procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indicators of blood circulation were measured before blood pressure reduction, 30 minutes after blood pressure reduction, just after the clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and 30 minutes after stopping blood pressure reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The S100B protein level in cerebrospinal fluid was observed before the controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and 0, 2, and 4 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was clipped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the mean blood flow velocity of parent artery and its main branches was performed by microvascular ultrasonics before and after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was clipped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed-up for one week after the operation to observe the neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MAP was decreased from 95 mm Hg +/- 12 mm Hg to 59 mm Hg +/- 5 mm Hg 30 minutes after the induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and resumed to 75 mm Hg +/- 8 mm Hg 30 minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was clipped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with those in the group B, both the total systemic vascular resistance and myocardial contract acceleration were decreased in group A, whereas the cardiac output and heart rate remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(2) 4 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was clipped the S100B protein level in CSF was increased significantly in both groups, and that in the group A being significantly higher than that in the group B (t = 2.854, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(3) In the group A, the mean arterial flow velocity of distal parent vessels increased by more than 30 percent in 8 out of the 15 patients and 3 of these 8 patients suffered from neurological deficits postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the mean arterial flow velocity of distal parent vessels in the group B increased by more than 30 percent in only 3 of the 15 patients and 2 of these 3 patients suffered from neurological deficits postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">Isoflurane</z:chebi> controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> may increase the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">Isoflurane</z:chebi> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery should be cautioned </plain></SENT>
