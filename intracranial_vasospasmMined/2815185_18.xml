<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with the controls, the patients showed decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration and decreased total arterial oxygen content due to postoperative hemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Global reductions in the metabolic rate for oxygen and in the tissue oxygen supply were noted even in the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex of the patients in spite of adequate blood flow and adequate oxygen extraction fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, regional reductions in blood flow and in perfusion reserve were seen in the cortical territory corresponding to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that two processes are involved in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>: 1) generalized impairment of oxygen metabolism with a reduced tissue oxygen supply, even in the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex, and 2) additional impairment of regional perfusion in the territory of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
