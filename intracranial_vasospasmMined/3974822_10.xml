<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primate model developed in this laboratory reliably induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and can induce pathologically proven delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With standard microsurgical procedures, an average 6.4-ml autologous <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was placed directly against the major anterior cerebral vessels in the right basal subarachnoid spaces of 24 monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monkeys were randomized to one of four groups and were treated orally q8h for 7 days with nimodipine (3, 6, or 12mg/kg)or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional 2 monkeys underwent the surgical procedure without clot placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug administration began between 14 and 20 hours after clot placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indices monitored before and after SAH included neurological status, angiographic cerebral vessel caliber, and cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant VSP (25 to 100% reduction in vessel caliber) was present on Day 7 on the clot side in 83% of the animals (P less than or equal to 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference (P greater than 0.05) in the incidence of VSP among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no significant difference (P greater than 0.05) in the mean vessel caliber reduction after SAH among the four treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no VSP present on Day 7 in the sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One animal receiving high dose nimodipine (12 mg/kg p.o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>q8h) developed a DIND on Day 5 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A second animal in the 12-mg/kg group developed a transient neurological deficit between Days 4 and 7 </plain></SENT>
