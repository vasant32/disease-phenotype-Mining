<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to evaluate the safety and preventative effect for vasospasm in patients treated with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of 17 patients managed postoperatively by the original <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> procedure developed neurological deterioration related to the method: two had intracranial haematoma (one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> interhemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo>, and the other with cerebellar haemorrhage), two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, and two failed to show abnormal findings on computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These pathological processes may be suitably referred to as "<z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> syndrome" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed ischaemic neurological deficits associated with low-density lesions on computed tomography were demonstrated in five patients (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these observations, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> method may not be as safe as described in the original articles, and is critically evaluated in terms of its preventative effect for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
