<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors aimed to investigate this hypothesis using in vivo microdialysis to examine time-dependent changes in the perivascular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and methemoglobin in a primate model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine cynomolgus monkeys underwent right-sided frontotemporal craniectomy and placement of a semipermeable microdialysis catheter adjacent to the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saline (control group, three animals) or an arterial blood clot (SAH group, six animals) was then placed around the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the catheter </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dialysate was collected daily for 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and methemoglobin were measured by means of spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perivascular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and methemoglobin peaked on Day 2 in the control monkeys and could not be detected on Days 5 to 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perivascular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> peaked on Day 7 in the SAH group, at which time the concentrations in the dialysate were 100-fold higher than in any sample obtained from the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Methemoglobin levels increased only slightly, peaking between Days 7 and 12, at which time the concentration in the dialysate was 10-fold higher than in samples from the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides in vivo evidence that the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> increase in the cerebral subarachnoid perivascular space during the development of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results support the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> is involved in the pathogenesis of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH and implicate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> as a possible vasospastic agent </plain></SENT>
