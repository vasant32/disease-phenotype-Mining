<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (ASAH) is a serious event with grave consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delayed ischemic neurological deficits caused by cerebral arterial vasospasm contribute significantly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers may reflect brain injury and provide an early warning of impending neurological decline and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from ASAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alpha-II spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein whose breakdown products are candidate surrogate markers of injury magnitude, treatment efficacy, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs) can provide information on the proteolytic mechanisms of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients who received a diagnosis of Fisher Grade 3 ASAH were enrolled in this study to examine the clinical utility of SBDPs in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients with ASAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent placement of a ventriculostomy for continual cerebrospinal fluid drainage within 72 hours of ASAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected every 6 hours and analyzed using Western Blotting for SBDPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm was defined as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of a focal neurological deficit or a change in Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of two or more points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> suspected cases of vasospasm were confirmed on imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both calpain- and caspase-mediated SBDP levels are significantly increased in patients suffering ASAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The concentration of SBDPs was found to increase significantly over baseline level up to 12 hours before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cerebral arterial vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression of SBDPs suggests oncotic necrotic proteolysis may be predominant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury after ASAH and cerebral arterial vasospasm </plain></SENT>
