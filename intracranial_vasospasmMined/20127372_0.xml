<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Etiopathogenesis of CV is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">Selenium</z:chebi> is the cofactor of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px) enzyme which is a very important defense mechanism against <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the literature, oxidants are known to play a remarkable role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm occurring after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, many studies have been conducted with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> agents, based on the theory that elevated activity of GSH-Px enzyme might prevent the development of CV after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Majority of those studies reported positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, as a result of our literature review, we came across no study which involves the investigation of the role of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> alone in the prevention of CV after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our study, we aim to find the answer to the following question: "Can <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> alone prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH at early stage?" METHODS: We used the "rat femoral artery vasospasm model" of Okada et al. as the vasospasm model of our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First, rats were divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 8), control group; group 2 (n = 8), vasospasm group; and group 3 (n = 8), vasospasm + <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparison of groups 1 and 2 revealed significant thickening in the vascular wall and a decrease in the lumen diameter in group 2, compared with group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparison of the vascular lumen diameters of groups 1 and 3 showed no significant difference, whereas the comparison of mean vascular wall thickness displayed a significant increase in group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, statistical comparison of groups 2 and 3 regarding vascular lumen diameters showed a significant decrease in group 2, whereas group 3 displayed a significant decrease in terms of vascular wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to the results of our study, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> morphometrically prevents the development of peripheral vasospasms </plain></SENT>
