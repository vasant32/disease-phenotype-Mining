<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>403 cases were operated upon with microsurgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality was 5.4 per cent, and 82.4 per cent of surgically treated cases are well and working, leading useful social lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that cases submitted to surgery in the first three days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) (the day of SAH being counted as the first day) showed good results, little appearance of postoperative vasospasm, and no mortality due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases operated upon after one week from the insult of SAH also showed good results, whereas fatal postoperative vasospasm was seen in cases operated upon on the 4th--7th day after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cisternal, ventricular, and epidural drainage are recommended after the clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 68 cases with preoperative vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no case in which vasospasm was identified during the first four days after SAH, while 66 per cent of the cases exhibited vasospasm between the sixth and ninth days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 68 cases can be classified into four groups: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>8 cases died from vasospasm before surgery: 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>8 cases had renewed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> mainly when vasospasm began to subside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>22 cases underwent surgery after vasospasm had subsided, the duration of vasospasm ranging from 8 to 24 days, on an average 14 days; 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>30 cases underwent surgery while vasospasm was still present; of this group, (4E) 15 cases submitted to surgery, on an average 4.5 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm, manifested deterioration of clinical states because of aggravation or new appearance of vasospasm; (4L, 15 cases which underwent surgery, on an average 7.4 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm, showed no such deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up, well and working cases were seen in 45.5 per cent (3.), 60 per cent (4E), and 80 per cent (4L), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The authors classified vasospasm into three types: Type 1, extensive diffuse, Type 2, multi-segmental, and Type 3, local </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Type 1 was prognostically worst, Type 3 good, and Type 2 was located between these two types </plain></SENT>
