<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> therapy improves symptoms and controls <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, possibly related to its vasorelaxive effects in spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some cases, however, are refractory to <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, there is no report of angioplasty for vasospasm from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 27-year-old woman presented 10 days postpartum with severe mental status changes and left arm and bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp> that were refractory to <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography demonstrated diffuse, severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We treated her with angioplasty of the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries, basilar artery, and bilateral internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angioplasty resulted in excellent angiographic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient immediately became responsive and appropriate with improved strength in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>She continued to improve throughout her hospital stay and was discharged 10 days postangioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral angioplasty is an effective treatment for vasospasm from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> refractory to <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angiography should be considered early in the course of neurological deterioration, but delayed therapy may also be effective </plain></SENT>
