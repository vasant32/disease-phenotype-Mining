<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">Ibuprofen</z:chebi> is an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">antiinflammatory agent</z:chebi> that inhibits the expression of specific cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and, consequently, disrupts leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> delivered locally from controlled-release polymers in the rabbit basilar artery (BA) model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">Ibuprofen</z:chebi> was incorporated into controlled-release <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="46916">vinyl acetate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> (EVAc) constituting 45% of the resulting polymer by weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four New Zealand White rabbits were randomized to 10 groups: sham operation (seven animals); SAH only (seven animals); and SAH plus either empty EVAc or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>-EVAc polymer at 30 minutes or 6, 12, or 24 hours (five animals per group; 40 total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rabbits were killed 72 hours after induction of SAH, at the time of maximal vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> in preventing vasospasm was assessed by measuring lumen patency of the rabbit's BAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intracranial controlled release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> resulted in a significant inhibition of vasospasm when treatment was initiated at 30 minutes (patency 92.3 +/- 5.1% compared with 52.1 +/- 5.1% in animals given empty EVAc; p &lt; 0.001) and 6 hours (patency 69.5 +/- 3.5% compared with 47.2 +/- 1.5% in animals given empty EVAc; p &lt; 0.03) after blood deposition compared with treatment with empty EVAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No effect was observed when treatment was begun at either 12 or 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Local intracranial delivery of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> accomplished using controlled-release polymers prevents vasospasm in the rabbit BA model of vasospasm when administered within 6 hours after blood exposure </plain></SENT>
