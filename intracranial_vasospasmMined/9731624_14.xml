<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relaxations mediated by nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> are impaired in cerebral arteries affected by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine the effect of SAH on the efficiency of ex vivo adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to canine basilar arteries and to examine whether expression of recombinant endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) gene may have functional effects on vasomotor reactivity of spastic arteries affected by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding bovine eNOS (AdCMVeNOS) and Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (AdCMVbeta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>) genes were used for ex vivo gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rings of basilar arteries obtained from control dogs and dogs exposed to SAH were incubated with the vectors in minimum essential medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after gene transfer, expression and function of the recombinant genes were evaluated by (1) histochemical or immunohistochemical staining, (2) beta-galactosidase protein measurement, and (3) isometric tension recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transduction with AdCMVbeta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> and AdCMVeNOS resulted in the expression of recombinant beta-galactosidase and eNOS proteins mostly in the vascular adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of beta-galactosidase protein was approximately 2-fold higher in SAH arteries than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent relaxations caused by bradykinin and substance P were suppressed in SAH arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relaxations to bradykinin were significantly augmented in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and SAH arteries after AdCMVeNOS transduction but not after AdCMVbeta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relaxations to substance P were augmented by AdCMVeNOS transduction only in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bradykinin and substance P caused relaxations even in endothelium-denuded arteries, when the vessels were transduced with AdCMVeNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These endothelium-independent (adventitia-dependent) relaxations to bradykinin observed after AdCMVeNOS transduction were similar between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and SAH arteries, whereas those to substance P were significantly reduced in SAH arteries compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that expression of recombinant proteins after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer may be enhanced in cerebral arteries affected by SAH and that successful eNOS gene transfer to spastic arteries can at least partly restore the impaired nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-mediated relaxations through local (adventitial) production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
