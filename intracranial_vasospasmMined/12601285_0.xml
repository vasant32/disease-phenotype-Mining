<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of measurement of colloid osmotic pressure (COP) directly concerned with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: The subjects were 20 patients who received clipping operation within 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a two weeks monitoring of COP measured directly by osmometer and evaluated serum concentrations of albumin at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into Group A (angiographical vasospasm +) and Group B (spasm -) according to the angiographical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences of the data between the groups were analyzed by ANOVA test (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the correlations between the serum concentrations of albumin and COP levels were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vasospasm was angiographically confirmed in 10 of the 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant decrease of COP levels was observed from day 7 until day 11 and significant decrease of albumin was observed on day 6 and from day 8 until day 11 in the Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not observe any significant change of COP and albumin levels in the Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A liner analysis was performed and a significant correlation was determined between the COP levels and albumin in the Group A, but we did not observe significant correlation between them in the Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that a significant decrease of COP levels indicate the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We concluded that COP measurement could be a useful monitor of the occurrence of vasospasm following SAH </plain></SENT>
