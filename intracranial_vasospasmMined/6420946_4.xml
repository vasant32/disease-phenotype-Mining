<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hemolysate contracted basilar arteries in a concentration-dependent fashion, the response being attenuated by treatment with either aspirin or polyphloretin phosphate, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49023">prostaglandin antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mesenteric arteries were contracted only slightly by high concentrations of hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the mesenteric arteries had partially been contracted with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, the hemolysate induced relaxations, which were abolished by aspirin in approximately half the preparations used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies on rat stomach strips exposed to superfusate of dog cerebral arteries showed a release of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi>-like substance by the hemolysate application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It may be concluded that the hemolysate contracts basilar arteries and relaxes mesenteric arteries, mainly through <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> synthesized in and released from the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
