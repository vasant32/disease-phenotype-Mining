<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) who are experiencing intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 441 consecutive patients with SAH, 100 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> and/or symptomatic CVS refractory to conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> (33-34 degrees C) was induced and maintained until intracranial pressure normalized, CVS resolved, or severe side effects occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> alone, and 87 were treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in combination with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients experienced poor-grade SAH (Hunt and Hess Grades IV and V) and 92 had Fisher Grade 3 and 4 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was 169 +/- 104 hours, with a maximum of 16.4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome after 1 year was evaluated in 90 of 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (35.6%) survived with good functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score, 4 and 5), 14 (15.5%) were severely disabled (GOS score, 3), 1 (1.1%) was in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> (GOS score, 2), and 43 (47.8%) died (GOS score, 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent side effects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003111'>electrolyte disorders</z:hpo> (77%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (52%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (47%), and septic shock syndrome (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 93 patients with severe side effects, 6 (6.5%) died as a result of respiratory or multi-organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prolonged systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> may be considered as a last-resort option for a carefully selected group of SAH patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or CVS resistant to conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, complications associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> require elaborate protocols in general intensive care unit management </plain></SENT>
