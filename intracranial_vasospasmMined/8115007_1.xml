<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects of these substances on delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were examined using a rabbit model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one anesthetized rabbits received intrathecal fresh arterial blood on day-1 and intrathecal administration of different doses of CGRP, VIP or distilled water on day-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to the treatment, caliber of the spastic basilar artery was 73.4 +/- 0.9% of pre-SAH values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial angiograms after treatment demonstrated that 10(-10)mol/kg of CGRP dilated the spastic artery to 117.1% of pre-SAH levels and that dilatory effect of CGRP continued up to 6 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VIP injection also brought arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> up to 114.9% of pre-SAH levels, although the duration of the effect was less than 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal administration of CGRP or VIP showed no adverse effect on the systemic and neurological state of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that intrathecal CGRP and VIP have therapeutic potential in treating delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are expected to extend the effect of CGRP and VIP </plain></SENT>
