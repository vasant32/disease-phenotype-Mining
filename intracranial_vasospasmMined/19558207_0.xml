<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore whether topical administration of Nimodipine improves the cerebral blood flow (CBF) following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen pigs were randomly divided into Sham group(n=4), SAH group(n=5) or SAH+ Nimodipine group(n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SAH model was established by injection of fresh autologous nonheparinized arterial blood into subtemporal area of basilar cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operative area was administrated with 0.04g/ml Nimodipine or saline placebo at 4 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBF was measured at 60 minutes after topical administration of nimodipine by cranial CT/SPECT scans with 5 mCi 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CCR (Corticocebellar ratio) was calculated by dividing the counts/voxel of the whole cerebral hemisphere by the average count /voxel in the cerebellar region of reference and RD (relative dispersion) was calculated by dividing standard deviation (SD) of regional perfusion by mean perfusion (RD=SD /Mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CCR and RD were applied to describe hemisphere CBF and perfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion significantly decreased in SAH group (CCR:1.382+/-0.192, RD:0.417+/-0.015) compared to sham group (CCR:1.988+/-0.346, RD 0.389+/-0.015) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, cerebral perfusion was not significantly improved in Nimodipine+SAH group (CCR: 1.503+/-0.107, RD: 0.425+/-0.018) compared to SAH group (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The topical administration of nimodipine may not significantly improve CBF following SAH, even our previous data shows that topical administration of nimodipine significantly alleviates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms need further investigation </plain></SENT>
