<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monkeys, NOS-IR was localized to the endothelial and adventitial layers of the large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the abluminal side, NOS-IR staining was densely concentrated in perivascular nerve fibers (nervi vasorum) of the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staining was less prominent in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six monkeys with vasospasm on Day 7 after placement of preclotted arterial blood to form an SAH around the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) (42% +/- 8.3% decrease of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area, mean +/- standard deviation), NOS-IR was virtually absent in nerve fibers around the spastic right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> but was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five monkeys in which vasospasm resolved by Day 14 after SAH (36% +/- 14% decrease of right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area on Day 7, and 5% +/- 14% decrease on Day 14), NOS-IR was also absent in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> adventitial nerve fibers and remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adventitial NOS-IR was also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in cerebral vessels of a sham-operated, nonspastic monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide further evidence that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) functions as a neuronal transmitter to mediate vasodilation in primates and indicate a role for adventitial NO in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in humans </plain></SENT>
