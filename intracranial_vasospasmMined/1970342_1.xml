<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In ring sections of the sheep middle cerebral artery, electrical field stimulation elicits a complex response due to the simultaneous release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> and vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haemolysate abolishes the relaxant effects of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> neurotransmitter and causes a marked augmentation of the contractile response in both the presence (448 +/- 191%) and absence (409 +/- 134%) of an intact endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The haemolysate also reverses relaxation induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> but has no effect on relaxation induced by 8-Br-cGMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> neurotransmitter therefore appears to act directly on the smooth muscle to cause relaxation by the stimulation of guanylate cyclase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> that are released are antagonised by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> (100 nM), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> (100 nM) and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (100 nM), which suggests that the transmitters involved are <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of these three <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> at 10 microM, there was 86.9 +/- 4.8% inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> (10 microM) causes a marked augmentation of the contractile response (267 +/- 56%) to field stimulation that can be reduced by pretreatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47781">desipramine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi>, inhibitors of noradrenergic and serotoninergic uptake mechanisms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> appears to be taken up into noradrenergic nerves and released as an alternative neurotransmitter upon subsequent stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These actions of haemolysate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> may be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> observed following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
