<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From October 1, 2008, the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Army Medical Department initiated a transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound service for TBI; included patients were retrospectively evaluated for TCD-determined incidence of post-traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after wartime TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety patients were investigated with daily TCD studies and a comprehensive TCD protocol, and published diagnostic criteria for vasospasm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD signs of mild, moderate, and severe vasospasms were observed in 37%, 22%, and 12% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD signs of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were recorded in 62.2%; 5 patients (4.5%) underwent transluminal angioplasty for post-traumatic clinical vasospasm treatment, and 16 (14.4%) had cranioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are frequent and significant complications of combat TBI; therefore, daily TCD monitoring is recommended for their recognition and subsequent management </plain></SENT>
