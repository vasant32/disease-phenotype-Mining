<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of nimodipine and papaverine (Pap) on the spastic arteries with delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (DCVS) in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A model of DCVS in dogs was induced by the cisterna magna injections of fresh autologous blood twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar arteries with and without DCVS was measured with the aid of a JVC operative microes cope in vivo after nimodipine and Pap were directly placed around the arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dilation of the basilar arteries was obviously induced by application of nimodipine and Pap in the dogs without DCVS no dilation was induced by application of nimodipine and slight dilation by application of Pap but in those with DCVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cerebral blood flow is improved by the effect of nimodipine on non-spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pap has been found to reverse slightly the narrowing of the basilar arteries with DCVS and to dilate the arteries without DCVS, but the vasodilation effect is transient </plain></SENT>
