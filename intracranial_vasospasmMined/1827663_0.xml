<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite numerous efforts to analyze the multifactorial pathomechanisms, it is still unclear whether vasospasm is a primary result caused by the release of vasoactive mediators or a secondary event due to severe destructions of the vessel architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed in order to investigate the reactivity of postmortem human basilar arteries upon exogenous vasoconstrictors, to study time-dependent changes in vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and to control responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, isolated rings and spirally cut strips of bovine- and human basilar arteries were incubated with exogenous vasoconstrictors and specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (Daltroban, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">Ketanserin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Light and electron microscopic studies were performed in order to analyze the morphological changes in vessel tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that postmortem human basilar arteries are a suitable pharmacological tool studying the effects of contractile mediators </plain></SENT>
