<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, and hemodilution is advocated for vasospasm, but it is unclear whether hemodilution confers any benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A finite element model of oxygen transport in the proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was used to evaluate the complex relationship among hematocrit, viscosity, oxygen content, and blood flow in the setting of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single-phase non-Newtonian finite element model based on three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations was constructed of the M1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model was solved at vessel stenoses ranging from 0% to 90% and hematocrit from 0.2 to 0.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A small area of poststenotic recirculation was seen with mild (30%) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poststenotic eddy formation was noted with more severe (60% to 90%) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Volumetric flow was inversely related to hematocrit at mild stenosis (0% to 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With near-complete stenosis (90%), a paradoxical increase in flow was seen with increasing hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oxygen transport across the segment was related to hematocrit at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of stenosis with increasing oxygen transport despite a reduction in blood flow, suggesting that with clinically significant vasospasm in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, hemodilution does not improve oxygen transport, but to the contrary, that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may be worsened </plain></SENT>
