<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No vaso-active drugs were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary function and intracranial pressure were monitored during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked improvement of neurological function was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients recovered completely without any neurological residual following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of the improvement observed during treatment closely correlated with the decrease in total peripheral resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infusion of albumin did not cause elevation of intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the hyperdynamic therapy induced by administration of albumin has a dramatic effect on the ischaemic cerebral insult caused by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that the main effect of this treatment is produced by cerebrovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
