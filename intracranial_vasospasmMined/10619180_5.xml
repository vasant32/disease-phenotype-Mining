<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of intracisternal application of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the permeability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in beagle dogs in order to evaluate its role in disruption of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability seen in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal application of their autologous blood for producing a canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model revealed an enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> permeability into the CSF together with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single dose of ET-1 (40 pmol/animal) significantly increased penetration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although its magnitude was much less than that in the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model after the first administration of ET-1, the second challenge of the same dose of ET-1 with a 48-h interval produced marked disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability similar to those in the animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ET-1-induced enhancement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> permeability into the CSF was completely prevented by intracisternal pretreatment with an endothelin ET(A)-receptor selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, S-0139 (0.03 mg/kg), as were the ET-1-induced cerebral vasoconstriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> as previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that ET-1 acting on the adventitial site of brain in dogs contributes to the disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability via endothelin ET(A)-receptor mediation </plain></SENT>
