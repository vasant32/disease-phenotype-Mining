<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect of HbO2 on subcellular Ca(++) release events (Ca(++) sparks) in cerebral artery myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calcium sparks provide a tonic hyperpolarizing and relaxing influence to vascular smooth muscle by the activation of plasmalemmal large-conductance Ca(++)-activated K+ channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence is provided that HbO2 may contract cerebral vascular muscle in part by free radical-mediated inhibition of Ca(++) sparks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Calcium sparks were visualized in intact pressurized rabbit cerebral arteries by using laser scanning confocal microscopy and a Ca(++) indicator dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcium spark frequency was reduced by approximately 65% after a 15-minute application of HbO2 (10(-4) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HbO2-induced decrease in Ca(++) spark frequency was prevented by a combination of the free radical scavengers <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and catalase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isometric force measurements were used to characterize the role of the vascular endothelium and smooth-muscle Ca(++) channels in HbO2-induced cerebral artery contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HbO2-induced contractions were independent of the vascular endothelium, but were abolished by diltiazem, a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent Ca(++) channels (VDCCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">Ryanodine</z:chebi>, a blocker of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi>-sensitive Ca(++) release channels located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, also reduced HbO2-induced contractions by approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that HbO2 may contract cerebral artery segments in part by inhibition of Ca(++) sparks, leading to decreased large-conductance Ca(++)-activated K+ channel activity, membrane potential depolarization, and enhanced Ca(++) entry through VDCCs </plain></SENT>
