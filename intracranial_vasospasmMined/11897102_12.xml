<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed previously that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> produces apoptotic changes in cultured endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to explore if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, a bi-product of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> degradation, will produce similar cytotoxicity in endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cultured bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells were incubated in four concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (10, 25, 50, and 100 microM) for varying times (6, 12, and 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control cells were incubated in saline or vehicle (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32145">NaOH</z:chebi> solution, &lt;0.01% of 0.01 N) for similar time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cultured cells were then observed microscopically for evidence of cellular alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> (10-100 microM) produced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> that appeared time-dependent but not clearly concentration-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biochemical markers for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> such as DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage were induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that endothelial cells may undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
