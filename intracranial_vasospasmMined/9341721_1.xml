<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Days after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can result in the delayed appearance of ischemic neurological deficit identical to that produced by other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the well-described, "classic" presentation of SAH, up to 25% of patients are initially misdiagnosed, and the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> will not always bring the patient to medical attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We report our experience with two patients who presented with signs and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that followed unrecognized rupture of a brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one case, it was the recent complaint of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and a prior history of SAH that led to the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other case, a major rebleed occurred before the accurate diagnosis was recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is critical to make the correct diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to vasospasm so that appropriate treatment can be instituted, thrombolytic and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy can be avoided, and the unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> can be obliterated to prevent potentially catastrophic rebleeding </plain></SENT>
