<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PDE isozymes extracted from the canine basilar artery were isolated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">diethylaminoethanol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> affinity chromatography and identified based on sensitivity to isozyme-selective PDE inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>[3H]cAMP hydrolysis was observed in one major and one minor peak of activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant peak was inhibited by the addition of cGMP (25%), siguazodan (26%), rolipram (39%), and the combination of siguazodan and rolipram (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective PDE IV inhibitors BRL 61063, rolipram, and denbufylline were equieffective inhibitors of [3H]-ccAMP hydrolysis mediated by PDE IV isolated from the canine basilar artery [concentrations producing 50% inhibition (IC50S) = 0.21 +/- 0.05 microM, 0.67 +/- 0.23 microM, and 0.73 +/- 0.16 microM, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In precontracted isolated ring segments of the canine basilar artery, selective PDE IV inhibitors produced potent and complete relaxation (IC50S &lt; 150 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, zaprinast (a selective PDE V inhibitor) and siguazodan (a selective PDE III inhibitor) produced only weak relaxation of the basilar artery (IC50S = 4.5 microM and &gt; 10 microM, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasorelaxation produced by PDE IV inhibitors was not altered by removing the endothelium, 1-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a canine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three selective PDE IV inhibitors reversed basilar artery spasm produced by autologous blood without altering mean arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, prolonged treatment with BRL 61063 failed to alter the development of basilar spasm in the two <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> canine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Denbufylline-induced relaxation in vitro was also significantly impaired in basilar arteries obtained from the model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PDE IV appears to be the predominant isozyme regulating vascular tone mediated by cAMP hydrolysis in cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, vasorelaxation modulated by PDE IV is compromised in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
