<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the Notch inhibitor--gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI1) exerted its effects on the vasospasm via regulation of NF-kappaB and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 160 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into four groups: Sham, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), SAH treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) and SAH treated with GSI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24h SAH, the mortality, neurological scores, blood-brain barrier permeability and brain water content were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level of Notch1, the expression and activity of NF-kappaB and MMP-9 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe morphological vasospasm in the basilar artery was observed in SAH and DMSO treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GSI1 significantly effected on neurological deficits, but not on mortality; significantly reduced morphological vasospasm, blood-brain barrier permeability, brain water content; significantly decreased the protein level of Notch1, NF-kappaB p50 and MMP-9, as well as the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB (EMSA) and the activity of MMP-9 (Zymography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that GSI1 plays a critical role in the attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, which may provide a novel therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH insult </plain></SENT>
