<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">Heme</z:chebi>-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is involved in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> catabolism and reduces the contractile effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we constructed 11R-fused HO-1 protein to achieve successful transduction of the protein into the cerebral arteries and examined the therapeutic effect of the 11R-HO-1 protein for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CV) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We injected the 11R-HO-1 protein into the cisterna magna of male rats and, several hours after the injection, performed immunofluorescence staining and western blotting analysis of the rat basilar arteries (BAs) to determine transduction efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed intraarterial HO-1 activity as cGMP (cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate) accumulation in SAH and determined whether protein transduction of 11R-HO-1 quantified the therapeutic effect in a rat double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BAs expressed significantly more HO-1 in the group injected with 11R-HO-1 (3.56±0.54 (11R-HO-1) versus control (saline)), and transduction of 11R-HO-1 resulted in higher activity (&gt;3.25-fold) in rat BAs with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results of the rat double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model showed that the 11R-HO-1 protein significantly attenuated CV after SAH (317.59±23.48 μm (11R-HO-1) versus 270.08±14.66 μm (11R-fused enhanced green fluorescent protein), 252.05±13.95 μm (saline), P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
