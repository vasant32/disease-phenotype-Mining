<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilution therapy (triple-H therapy) is a generally accepted treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the particular role of the three components of triple-H therapy remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the three arms of triple-H therapy on regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Animal research and clinical intervention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND PATIENTS: Experiments were carried out in five healthy pigs, followed by a clinical investigation of ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: First, we investigated the effect of the three components of triple-H therapy under physiologic conditions in an experimental pig model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the next step we applied the same study protocol to patients following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cardiac output, regional cerebral blood flow, and brain tissue oxygenation were continuously recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intrathoracic blood volume and central venous pressure were measured intermittently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vasopressors and/or colloids and crystalloids were administered to stepwise establish the three components of triple-H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the animals, neither induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> had an effect on intracranial pressure, brain tissue oxygenation, or regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the patient population, induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (mean arterial pressure 143 +/- 10 mm Hg) resulted in a significant (p &lt; .05) increase of regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observation time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>/hemodilution (intrathoracic blood volume index 1123 +/- 152 mL/m) induced only a slight increase of regional cerebral blood flow while brain tissue oxygenation did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, triple-H therapy failed to improve regional cerebral blood flow more than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> alone and was characterized by the drawback that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>/hemodilution component reversed the effect of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on brain tissue oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressor-induced elevation of mean arterial pressure caused a significant increase of regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Volume expansion resulted in a slight effect on regional cerebral blood flow only but reversed the effect on brain tissue oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In view of the questionable benefit of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> on regional cerebral blood flow and the negative consequences on brain tissue oxygenation together with the increased risk of complications, hypervolemic therapy as a part of triple-H therapy should be applied with utmost caution </plain></SENT>
