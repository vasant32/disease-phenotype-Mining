<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported that function of voltage-gated K+ (KV) channels was significantly decreased during vasospasm 7 days after SAH in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since arterial constriction is regulated by membrane potential that in turn is determined predominately by K+ conductance, the compromised K+ channel dysfunction may cause vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional support for this hypothesis would be demonstration that K+ channel dysfunction is temporally coincident with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, SAH was created using the double haemorrhage model in dogs and smooth muscle cells from the basilar artery, which develops vasospasm, were isolated 4 days (early vasospasm), 7 days (during vasospasm) and 21 days (after vasospasm) after SAH and studied using patch-clamp electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the two main K+ channels (KV and large-conductance voltage/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-activated (KCa) channels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologic function of KCa channels was preserved at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, function of KV channels was significantly decreased at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decrease in cell size and degree of KV channel dysfunction was maximal 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that KV channel dysfunction either only partially contributes to vasospasm after SAH or that compensatory mechanisms develop that lead to resolution of vasospasm before KV channels recover their function </plain></SENT>
