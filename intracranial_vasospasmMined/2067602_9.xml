<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (26 caused by rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) were examined by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography by using a 2.25-MHz ultrasound transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 20 of these 26 patients (76%), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> could be identified by a characteristic abnormal blood flow pattern within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in coronal and axial scanning planes by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood within the basal cisterns, on top of the tentorium, and within the ventricles and parenchyma was sonographically detected by increased echodensity in 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbances and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were detected in two-dimensional B-mode images in 85% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Doppler mode, intravascular blood flow velocity could be quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that transcranial color-coded real-time sonography, a new, noninvasive method for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, allows detection of the primary vascular lesion and monitoring of complications </plain></SENT>
