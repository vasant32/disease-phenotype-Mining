<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), using an immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Female Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by perfusion fixation 10 min, 6 h, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 or 14 days after a single intracisternal injection of fresh autologous arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis of lumen cross-sectional areas of blood vessels were determined by computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were expressed as percent lumen patency, defined as the ratio of the area of vessel patency in SAH rats to the area of patency in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical analysis against bFGF was performed using the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immuno-reactivity of bFGF was observed with the aid of a light microscope and semiquantitatively graded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar arterial spasm was greatest 10 min after SAH (mean decrease: 67.1% of the control values; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, there was a significant degree of spasm of the artery for three days after SAH, followed by full recovery at day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A slight increase in immunoreactivity was observed in the intima only at 10 min and one day after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the media, immunoreactivity showed a biphasic pattern; a significant increase in immunoreactivity was observed at 10 min that persisted for two days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At three days after SAH, immunoreactivity in the media returned to the control level, but then gradually increased significantly to reach a maximum at 14 days after SAH while the vascular dimensions were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis failed to show a direct relationship between bFGF and the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in this rat single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the late phase upregulation of bFGF might lead to the vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of SAH </plain></SENT>
