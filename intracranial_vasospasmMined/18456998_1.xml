<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests VDCC activity is increased and Kv channel activity is decreased in cerebral arteries following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), promoting enhanced constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the impact of the blood component <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> on Kv and VDCC function in small (100-200 microm) diameter cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> (10 min) exposure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> caused cerebral artery constriction and Kv current suppression that was abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> and a Kv channel blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> application did not directly alter VDCC activity, five-day exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> was associated with enhanced expression of voltage-dependent calcium channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This work suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> act synergistically to promote membrane depolarization and increased VDCC activity in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> may contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
