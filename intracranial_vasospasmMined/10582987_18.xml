<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most common cause of poor treatment outcome in patients suffering aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, especially in cases of poor Hunt and Hess grades (IV and V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A further prognostic factor in surgically treated patients is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present retrospective study is to compare the endovascular treatment outcome in such poor-grade patients according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> localization in either the anterior (AC) or posterior (PC) circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty poor-grade patients admitted between 1993 and July 1998 were treated by endovascular approach within 23 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the AC, 22 in the PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean treatment delay was 4 days after rupture and median, 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient showed multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 36 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were occluded by Guglielmi detachable coils; in 4 cases, by parent vessel balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of delayed ischemic neurological dysfunction or cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> due to vasospasm did not differ significantly between the AC and PC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two procedure-related complications with clinical effect were observed in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 6 months' follow-up, the result was good in 5 patients and poor in 13 in the AC group and good in 11 patients and poor in 11 in the PC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given comparable incidence of vasospasm in poor-grade patients, a tendency toward better treatment outcome was found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the posterior circulation (chi(2)=2.04; P=0.15) than in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy for poor-grade patients is recommended, as are further studies to determine treatment differences </plain></SENT>
