<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many factors complicate head injury and worsen an outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of these factors is posttraumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 75 patients admitted to the University of Mississippi Medical Center with head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 14 to 67 years (mean 30 years, SD 11.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of the patients were men, and 20% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 53 (70.6%) suffered severe blunt trauma, and 4 patients suffered gunshot wounds to the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had mild head injury, and 14 had moderate head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Posttraumatic vasospasm was detected in 24 (32%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 19 (79.2%) had severe closed head injury, 3 patients had moderate head injury, and 2 suffered gunshot wounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The severity of the patient's respective condition was correlated with the development of posttraumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>: 50% of the patients with Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) 3-4 developed PTV, and only 30% with GCS 9-11, and none of the patients with GCS &gt; 12 developed PTV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, posttraumatic vasospasm started earlier and had a shorter course than did aneurysmal vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, posttraumatic vasospasm resembled the features of aneurysmal vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We found increased corrugation of the internal elastic lamina and increased amounts of connective tissue in the subendothelial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings show that posttraumatic vasospasm, although clinically more mild, demonstrates the same morphological changes as aneurysmal vasospasm </plain></SENT>
