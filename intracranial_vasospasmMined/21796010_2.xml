<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is an independent predictor of poor outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (NO-cGMP) vasodilatory pathway is strongly implicated in its pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies suggest that phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), an enzyme that degrades cGMP, may play a role because the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil was found to reduce vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, several questions that are critical when considering translational studies remain unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanism of action of sildenafil against vasospasm and to assess whether sildenafil attenuates SAH-induced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, improves functional outcome after SAH, or causes significant physiological side effects when administered at therapeutically relevant doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH was induced via endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in male C57BL6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beginning 2 hours later, mice received sildenafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> (0.7, 2 or 5 mg/kg orally twice daily) or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome was assessed daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was determined on post-SAH day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain PDE5 expression and activity, cGMP content, neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, arterial blood pressure, and intracranial pressure were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that PDE5 activity (but not expression) is increased after SAH, leading to decreased cGMP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sildenafil attenuates this increase in PDE5 activity and restores cGMP levels after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-SAH initiation of sildenafil was found to decrease vasospasm and neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and markedly improve neurological outcome without causing significant physiological side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sildenafil, a US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug with a proven track record of safety in humans, is a promising new therapy for vasospasm and neurological deficits after SAH </plain></SENT>
