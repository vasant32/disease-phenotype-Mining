<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In September 1999, results from a phase II clinical trial in 45 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of MS were presented at the Warburg Dillion Read Global Life Sciences Conference (New York) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of four weekly doses of rovelizumab, as compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rovelizumab was shown to be safe, but demonstrated no clinical benefit for the recovery of neurological functioning [341638] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In February 1997, ICOS announced the initiation of a phase II trial in MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The placebo-controlled trial is being coordinated by the Mayo Physician Alliance for Cardiovascular Trials and will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in 60 patients [234046,264363] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient enrollment for this, and an open label phase II trial in trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock, was completed in September 1997 [264363] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An expanded shock trial in 150 trauma patients, is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 1998 [296831] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An expanded trial for MI was also planned [264363] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The company is to evaluate rovelizumab in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and a double-blind, dose-escalating, placebo-controlled phase II trial has been initiated at several centers in the US [264363] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A patient population of 48 was tested, with patient dosing occurring within 12 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in SAEs between rovelizumab and placebo treatment, and no immunogenicity was observed [315799] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection was observed in a rabbit model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with greatest reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> noted in the cortical areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
