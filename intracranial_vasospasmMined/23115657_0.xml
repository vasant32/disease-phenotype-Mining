<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the role of intra-arterial (IA) nimodipine injections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> secondary to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and to investigate the factors that influence vasodilation and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 29 patients who underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> between 2009 and 2011, and who received IA nimodipine after subsequently presenting with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasodilation shown in angiography was measured, and the correlation between the degree of vasodilation and both the interval from SAH to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the interval from clipping to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The change in blood flow rate after IA injection was assessed by transcranial Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple clinical parameters were completed before and after IA nimodipine injection to evaluate any improvements in clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For eight patients, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) scores increased by two or more points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regression analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the change in GCS scores after IA nimodipine injection and the change in blood vessel diameter (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was also observed between the interval from SAH to vasospasm and the change in diameter (p=0.040); and the interval from clipping to vasospasm and the change in diameter (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IA nimodipine injection for SAH-induced vasospasm led to significant vasodilation in angiography and improvement in clinical symptoms without significant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that IA nimodipine injection should be utilized when intractable vasospasm develops despite rigorous conservative management </plain></SENT>
