<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of patients presenting to our institution with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> between 1980-1990 was accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven variables were examined as to their relationship to clinical vasospasm: age, sex, clinical grade, amount of subarachnoid blood on CT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location, incidence of vasospasm, incidence of complications, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>, time to surgery, length of stay, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistical regression methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, age under 20, amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and clinical grade were associated with a higher risk of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate logistic regression, these factors, along with age under 35, were correlated as being predictive of clinical vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are grouped into either good or bad outcome, and a similar analysis is performed, only in the poor outcome group is the amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and clinical grade correlated with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that there is a group of patients with a predisposition to vasospasm that is independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and clinical grade, and that these patients may have a more favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
