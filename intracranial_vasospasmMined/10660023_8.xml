<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can occur after cranial base <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a series of nine patients with angiographically evident vasospasm that was clinically symptomatic in eight of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 470 consecutive patients with cranial base <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were operated in our institution between April 1993 and December 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine had evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> postoperatively (1.9% of the total population), of whom eight were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were seven males and two females with an age range of 33 to 65 years (average 48.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0010762'>chordoma</z:hpo>, and one trigeminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>schwannoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vasospasm manifested clinically 1 to 30 days postoperatively in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients were symptomatic within 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the ninth case, surgery was delayed when asymptomatic vasospasm was noted on an angiogram before second stage surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptoms included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> in four patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in three patients (one patient had both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e>), and monoparesis in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factors that were found to correlate with a higher incidence of vasospasm were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, total operative time, vessel encasement, vessel narrowing, and preoperative embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients with symptomatic vasospasm were treated with hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHH</z:e>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five patients also underwent intraluminal angioplasty, in conjunction with papaverine in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient received intraarterial papaverine alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Angiographic results were good in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Significant clinical improvement was seen in six of the eight symptomatic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Delayed neurological deterioration in a patient who has undergone cranial base <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> surgery not explained by an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial mass</z:e> lesion should be promptly investigated with angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>If vasospasm is diagnosed, it should be treated aggressively with hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional therapy and early angioplasty </plain></SENT>
