<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 188 patients (nimodipine (N) = 102, placebo (P) = 86) were enrolled in the study, both pre- and postoperatively, within 24 hours of clinical deterioration connected with vasospasm or within 24 hours of arteriography that identified vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 61 patients were excluded for not meeting study criteria or for protocol violation, the results were supported by 127 validated case reports: 73 patients received intravenous treatment with nimodipine, and 54 were given placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the main criterion of efficacy, the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and of patients with severe deficit related to vasospasm alone, showed a significant statistical difference (N = 8 (19%), P = 17 (49%), P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability was reduced by 66% in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of this criterion by type of inclusion (clinical or angiographic) also showed a significant reduction in the clinical group (P = 0.05), but there was no difference in the angiographic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of mortality connected with vasospasm was reduced by 82%, but analysis by group showed that there was no significant difference for those patients included on clinical criteria, whereas mortality was reduced to a much greater extent in the angiographic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of nimodipine in reducing secondary ischemic brain damage in patients already suffering from angiographic vasospasm or delayed ischemic deterioration </plain></SENT>
