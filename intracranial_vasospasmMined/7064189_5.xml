<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 26 patients with recent rupture of an intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> the CSF concentrations of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) were measured repeatedly by a radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> level in ventricular CSF collected between the 2nd and 15th day after SAH ranged between less than 2 and 5 nmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These did not differ from the levels found in the ventricular CSF (less than 2-3 nmol/l) and lumbar CSF (less than 2-3 nmol/l) of control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> concentrations did not correlate with the severity of angiographical vasospasm, nor with CSF pressure or clinical grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients with severe postoperative vasospasm, however, cisternal CSF collected during operation and contaminated by fresh blood showed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> concentrations exceeding 25 nmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, although these results do not support the conception that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> plays a major role in sustaining delayed vasospasm, they suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> liberated from platelets may be operative in the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
