<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several treatment modalities have been proposed, and none of them are fully effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study we treated five patients with prostacyclin suffering vasospasm after a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> not responding to high i.v. doses of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were severely ill, unconscious and in need of intensive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: A low dose of prostacyclin i.v. infusion for 72 h reversed the vasospasm as measured by transcranial Doppler technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow velocity decreased from 199 +/- 31 cm/s to 92 +/- 6 cm/s within 72 h after the start of the prostacyclin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that low-dose prostacyclin treatment, an old treatment strategy, can be a treatment option in patients with vasospasm not responding to ordinary measures </plain></SENT>
