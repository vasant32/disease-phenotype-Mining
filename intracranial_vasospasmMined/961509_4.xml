<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Good or fair results were obtained in 76%, 12% of patients had a poor result and the mortality was 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major factors which were found to influence the outcome of surgery were: pre-operatively, the Botterell grade of the patient, pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> and the time interval between the last <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively, the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was associated with a poor outcome from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Better results might be obtained from the surgery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> by delaying operation to the second week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and by better management of hypertensive patients pre-operatively and patients who develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> post-operatively </plain></SENT>
