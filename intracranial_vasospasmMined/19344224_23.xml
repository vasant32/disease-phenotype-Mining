<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Delayed ischemic deficits (DIDs), a major source of disability following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH), are usually associated with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systemic erythropoietin (EPO) therapy has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective properties acting via EPO receptors on cerebrovascular endothelia and ischemic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this trial, the authors explored the potential neuroprotective effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> EPO therapy following aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within 72 hours of aSAH, 80 patients (age range 24-82 years) were randomized to receive intravenous EPO (30,000 U) or placebo every 48 hours for a total of 90,000 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were the incidence, duration, and severity of vasospasm and impaired autoregulation on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were incidence of DIDs and outcome at discharge and at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Randomization characteristics were balanced except for age, with the EPO group being older (mean age 59.6 vs 53.3 years, p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were demonstrated in the incidence of vasospasm and adverse events; however, patients receiving EPO had a decreased incidence of severe vasospasm from 27.5 to 7.5% (p=0.037), reduced DIDs with new cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> from 40.0 to 7.5% (p=0.001), a shortened duration of impaired autoregulation (ipsilateral side, p&lt;0.001), and more favorable outcome at discharge (favorable Glasgow Outcome Scale score, p=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 71 survivors, the EPO group had fewer deficits measured with National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (median Score 2 vs 6, p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study showed that EPO seemed to reduce delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> following aSAH via decreasing severity of vasospasm and shortening impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
