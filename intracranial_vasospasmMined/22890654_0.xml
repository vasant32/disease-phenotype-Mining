<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 579 SAH patients in the Prospective Registry of Subarachnoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> Treatment project, and these patients were treated either microsurgically or endovascularly within 12 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of vasospasm was compared between patients treated with clipping and coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clipping (282 patients) was preferably performed for small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a wide neck or middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysms</z:hpo> and was followed by cerebrospinal fluid drainage; coiling (297 patients) was preferred for older patients, larger, internal carotid artery and posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, or treatment during a nonacute stage and more frequently followed by antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses showed that vasospasm-induced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> occurred more frequently in clipped patients than in coiled patients, but this difference disappeared after multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher incidence of vasospasm-induced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after clipping was explained by the fact that clipping was selected more for the ruptured middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> with massive SAH or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, in which vasospasm more frequently occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment modalities (clip or coil) may not significantly affect the incidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
