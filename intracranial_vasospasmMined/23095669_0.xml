<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On review of a series of research articles that focus on defensive host responses to SAH, PDGF-BB is identified as a spasmogen, based on the following findings: (1) foreign substances injected into the subarachnoid space cause persistent constriction of cerebral arteries with a time course and histological features almost identical to those seen after SAH; (2) persistent constriction induced by SAH or a foreign substance is dependent on the complement system; (3) the complement system, which stimulates platelets, macrophages and endothelial cells to secrete PDGF-BB, is activated in both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma immediately after SAH; (4) PDGF-BB levels in the CSF are significantly elevated in patients with delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>; (5) the immunodensity of PDGF-BB in the arterial walls correlates well with the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>; (6) intracisternal injection of PDGF-BB induces persistent constriction of cerebral arteries in a dose-dependent manner; (7) prolonged contact with blood clots promotes the contractile response of cerebral arteries to PDGF-BB, and (8) administration of an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of PDGF-BB function suppresses the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
