<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> complicates both surgical and endovascular treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study analyzes patients with presentation vasospasm (PVSP) treated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting and compares outcomes in those treated with surgical clipping versus endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 600 aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) patients who were admitted to the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago between June 2002 and July 2007 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with clinical vasospasm on presentation were compared with patients who developed delayed vasospasm during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis compared outcomes in patients with vasospasm on presentation treated with surgical clipping versus endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 600 aSAH patients, 30 (5%) patients presented with symptomatic vasospasm (PVSP) confirmed by cerebral angiography and 179 (30%) patients were diagnosed with symptomatic vasospasm following admission (delayed vasospasm after admission [DVSP]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients admitted with vasospasm showed longer latency to admission after the rupture (5.5 vs. 1.5 day, P â‰¤ 0.001) but comparable latency to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic vasospasm after rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &gt; 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment during the vasospasm period did not result in increased morbidity in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the subgroup of patients presenting with vasospasm on admission, there was no significant difference in outcome between patients who were treated with clipping versus coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Outcome did not differ between aSAH patients treated in the presence of symptomatic vasospasm compared to those with subsequent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The outcome of patients presenting with vasospasm was not influenced by the modality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that both surgical and endovascular intervention for the treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are equally valid options in the setting of existing symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
