<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and mortality was low in the patients who had cisternal drainage, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was significantly higher in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drainage has been recommended as a useful procedure because it has been shown to improve the prognosis through prophylaxis and relief of vasospasm and removal of blood-contaminated cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the results of this study indicate that extensive cerebrospinal fluid drainage may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, which can be controlled by regulation of the drainage outflow and pressure </plain></SENT>
