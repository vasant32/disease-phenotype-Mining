<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The early and delayed groups were comparable demographically and neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall results for the early group were a good outcome in 65%, poor outcome in 10% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 24%, compared to 53, 20 and 27% respectively in the delayed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with an early operation and CSF drainage had better results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permanent ischaemic neurological deficits due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> accounted for the poor outcome in 10 and 21% of the patients in the early and delayed groups, respectively and rebleeding accounted for the poor outcome in 5 and 10% in the early and delayed groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean amount of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> in the cerebrospinal fluid from cisternal drainage was 6.4 g, corresponding to about 40 ml of whole blood, during the 12-day period after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level was higher in patients with larger subarachnoid clots or with symptomatic vasospasm than in those with smaller clots or without such vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early operation combined with ventricular and cisternal drainage is considered to be a useful surgical method for patient with a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
