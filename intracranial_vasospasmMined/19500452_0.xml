<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of topiramate (TPM) to prevent neural injury in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of TPM on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into three groups randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were as follows: (1) sham operated (no SAH (n=18); (2) SAH only (n=17); (3) SAH + TPM (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal sections were evaluated for neural tissue degeneration, using the previously described neural degeneration scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ApopTag peroxidase in situ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> detection kit (Serologicals Corp., former Intergen) was used to assess <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the hippocampal sections and the effect of TPM on the apoptotic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery lumen areas and arterial wall thickness were also measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the mean degeneration scores of the control and SAH only groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of neural degeneration in TPM treated group was significantly lower compared with SAH only group (p&lt;0.05), but not significantly higher than the control group (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between arterial cross-sectional area and arterial wall thickness measurements of the SAH group and SAH + TPM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that TPM has marked neuroprotective effect in an experimental model of SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This observation may have clinical implications suggesting that this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug could be used as a possible neuroprotective agent in patients without major adverse effects </plain></SENT>
