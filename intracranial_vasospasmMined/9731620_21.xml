<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While it has been widely reported that the vasospasm following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is prevented/reversed by endothelin (ET) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> selective for the ET(A) receptor and by nonselective ET receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, ie, <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of both the ET(A) and ET(B) receptors, there are no reports on the possible attenuation of the spasm by selective ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether (1) ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> prevent and reverse SAH-induced spasm and (2) attenuation of the spasm results from blockade of smooth muscle ET(B) (ET(B2)) receptor-mediated constriction and/or endothelial ET(B) (ET(B1)) receptor-mediated ET-1-induced ET-1 release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH-induced spasm of the rabbit basilar artery was induced with the use of a double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo effects of agents on the spasm were determined by angiography after their intracisternal infusion (10 microL/h) by mini osmotic pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ effects of agents on the spasm were determined by direct measurement of vessel diameter after their suffusion in a cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAH constricted the basilar artery by 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal infusion with 10 micromol/L BQ788, an ET(B1/B2) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, reduced the spasm to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether BQ788 prevented the spasm by blockade of ET(B1) receptor-mediated ET-1-induced ET-1 release, as opposed to ET(B2) receptor-mediated constriction, we tested whether ET(B1) receptor blockade also prevented the spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, intracisternal infusion with 10 micromol/L RES-701-1, a selective ET(B1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, reduced the spasm to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in situ superfusion with 1 micromol/L BQ788 reversed the spasm by 40%, and 1 micromol/L RES-701-1 reversed the spasm by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, both BQ788 and RES-701-1 enhanced by 40% to 50% the 3 nmol/L ET-1-induced constriction elicited in spastic vessels previously relaxed with 0.1 mmol/L phosphoramidon, an ET-converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> prevent and reverse SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The likely mechanism underlying the attenuation of the spasm is blockade of ET(B1) receptor-mediated ET-1-induced ET-1 release of newly synthesized ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These studies provide rationale for the therapeutic use of ET(B1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> to relieve the vasospasm following SAH, as well as other pathophysiological conditions involving possible ET-1-induced ET-1 release </plain></SENT>
