<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presented study was designed to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase inhibitor, Zn (II) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX, on vasospasm process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: in this study 20 male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2,500 to 3,000 g were randomly assigned to four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals in group 1 were controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 2, animals were SAH induced only and no treatment given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SAH induced animals in group 3 received intracisternal Zn (II) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX 0.5 mg/kg in DMSO solution, at 0 and 24 h of SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 4, animals received only intracisternal DMSO at 0 and 24 h after SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were sacrificed via exsanguination at 72 h after induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brains and brainstems with overlying basilar arteries were removed and stored in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> at +4Â°C overnight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were sectioned from four seperate zones, and four sections were obtained from each rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas and vessel wall thicknesses were measured by using SPOT for Windows version 4.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney and ANOVA tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: basilar arterial wall thicknesses in group 3 were smaller than that of group 2 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> section areas in group 3 were significantly greater than <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas of group 2 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ZnPP has a potentially beneficial effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
