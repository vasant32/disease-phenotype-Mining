<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of the endothelium and of endogenous endothelin (ET) on the NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (L-NOARG)-induced contractions in isolated rat basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>L-NOARG, NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> esther, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>, but not D-NOARG, induced concentration-dependent contractions and spontaneous vasomotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of L-NOARG was reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> and submaximally reduced in de-endothelialized arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contractile effect of L-NOARG was completely suppressed by the ET-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> BQ 123 and Ro 46-2005 in a part of the basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After washout of the respective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, the L-NOARG-induced contraction started, but was not influenced by a second application of the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another part of preparations the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> failed to influence the L-NOARG-induced contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inconsistent suppressor effects were also observed after preincubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi>, Manning compound, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> reversed the established L-NOARG-induced contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, endothelium-derived NO suppresses spontaneous contraction and vasomotion in rat basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endogenous ET, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, vasopressin, angiotensin or cyclooxygenase metabolites do not cause the contraction induced by inhibition of the NO synthase, but may act as 'trigger factors', that may play a role in rat models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> or infarction </plain></SENT>
