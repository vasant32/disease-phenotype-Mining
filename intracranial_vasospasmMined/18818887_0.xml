<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors present a safety evaluation of the perioperative use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in a series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients undergoing microsurgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of the records of 18 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients who underwent craniotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping and received an intraoperative dose of rFVIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each case, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was felt to be a "high risk" lesion for intraoperative rupture either because it had bled multiple times prior to surgery or based on anatomical considerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> complications were recorded whether or not they were attributed to the use of rFVIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients, 7 men and 11 women, ranging in age from 42 to 85 years were included in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (50%) were either Hunt/Hess Grades IV or V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients developed clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients required ventricular drainage on admission, and seven patients ultimately required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One lower extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and seven upper extremity venous thromboses in association with peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines were identified on screening Doppler evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ruptured intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe our experience with the use of a single dose of rFVIIa administered perioperatively in an attempt to decrease the rate of intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture in patients undergoing microsurgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant immediate or long-term adverse effects attributable to the use of rFVIIa in this group, and we encountered no intraoperative ruptures in this relatively small series </plain></SENT>
