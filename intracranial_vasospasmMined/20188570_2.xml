<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were divided into 5 groups: G1, no intervention; G2, sham surgery without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH); G3, SAH only; G4, SAH plus nimodipine treatment; G5, SAH plus ebselen treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For G2 animals, physiological saline (0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>) was injected into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For G3, G4 and G5 animals, SAH was induced by injecting autologous non-heparinized blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hour after injection, G4 animals received nimodipine at 6-hour intervals and G5 animals received ebselen twice a day for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment, brain tissue and blood samples were taken for biochemical and histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean malonyldialdehyde concentration was significantly higher in G3 than in G1 (p&lt;0.0001), G2 (p=0.01), G4 (p=0.002) and G5 (p=0.014), and significantly higher in G5 than in G1 (p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activity was significantly lower in G4 than in both G1 (p=0.025) and G2 (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean wall thickness was significantly greater in G3 than in G1 (p&lt;0.0001), G2 (p=0.01), G4 (p&lt;0.0001) and G5 (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean wall thickness was also significantly greater in both G1 and G2 than in G4 (p&lt;0.0014 and p&lt;0.0001) and G5 (p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter of the basilar artery was significantly smaller in G3 than in G2 (p=0.02), G4 (p&lt;0.018) and G5 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that ebselen may have neuroprotective effects by acting to prevent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
