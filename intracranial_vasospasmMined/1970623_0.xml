<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The advances in management of victims struck by the rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 1970s the management outcome was still far from acceptable; many victims who had 'recovered' following a major aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) succumbed or became crippled as the result of repeat bleeds and/or delayed SAH-induced ischaemic deterioration ('<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The era of prosperity for microneurosurgery, the introduction of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> nimodipine and the accumulation of cases in centres with a team of dedicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgeons form the basis of a recent breakthrough in the previously gloomy management outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With microsurgical techniques elective surgery can now be performed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage thereby preventing disastrous reruptures which occur frequently in the early phase after the first bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concomitant use of nimodipine minimizes delayed SAH-induced ischaemic deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Today a management regime including early operation combined with nimodipine has led to grossly improved results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e> and psychosocial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0281902" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">maladjustment</z:e> are frequent sequelae following a major aneurysmal bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hope for further improvements could depend on the development of techniques which may allow identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> before they rupture and increased knowledge of the aetiology of such cerebral arterial wall lesions </plain></SENT>
