<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation is present in vasospastic cerebral vessels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and may result from deficient production of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) or increased production and/or activity of inducible NOS (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A2A receptors increase the production of NO by human and porcine arterial endothelial cells, which in turn leads to vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the effects of an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A2A receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, (2(4-[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50329">2-carboxyethyl</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>)ethylamino)-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680), in the prevention of SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting 0.3 ml of autologous blood into the cisterna magna of each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal injections of CGS 21680 or vehicle were administered 5 minutes and 24 hours after induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm was determined by averaging measurements of cross-sectional areas of the basilar artery (BA) 48 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of eNOS and iNOS in the BA was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior to perfusion-fixation, there were no significant differences among animals in the control and treated groups in any physiological parameter that was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CGS 21680 treatment significantly attenuated SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Induction of iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in the BA by the SAH was significantly diminished by administration of CGS 21680 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The SAH-induced suppression of eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein was also relieved by the CGS 21680 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A2A receptor agonism is effective in preventing SAH-induced vasospasm without significant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A2A receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may be, at least in part, related to the prevention of augmented expression of iNOS and the preservation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eNOS expression following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> A2A receptor agonism holds promise in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH and merits further investigation </plain></SENT>
