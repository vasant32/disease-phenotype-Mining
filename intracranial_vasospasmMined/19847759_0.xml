<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">Chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cl-</z:chebi>) channels exist in vascular smooth muscle and activation of these channels leads to depolarization and contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to test the effect of 5-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16150">benzoate</z:chebi> (NPPB), a <z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cl-</z:chebi> channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on the ET-1-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rabbit basilar artery and thus investigate the contribution of <z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cl-</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty rabbits were divided into five groups and received intra-arterial injection of isotonic saline (Group I, n=6), ET-1 (group II, n=6), ET-1 plus NPPB (Group III, n=6), dimethylsulfate (DMSO4) (Group IV, n = 6) and NPPB (Group V, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre and post injection basilar artery diameters were measured in each group and transmission electron microscopic investigations on basilar arteries were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean pre-injection and post-injection vessel diameters were 0.8833 mm and 0.7000 mm in ET-1 group, 0.6833 mm and 0.8500 mm in ET-1 + NPPB group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NPPB administered prior to ET-1 injection, prevented the ET-1-induced vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, NPPB prevents the ET-1 induced changes in vessel wall and neurons in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study add further insights to our armamentarium against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
