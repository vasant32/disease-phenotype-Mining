<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) as a result of vasospasm remain the main cause of morbidity among patients who manage to survive this severe disease pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the traditional treatment options, either medical or interventional, fail to reverse vasospasm, continuous intraarterial infusion of nimodipine through catheters directly into the spastic arteries presents a promising treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 73 patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> between 2008 and 2009, a total of 27 had Hunt and Hess grades of 4 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen percent of them showed refractory vasospasms and were treated with continuous nimodipine infusion via catheters in both internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
