<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013146" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Drug abuse</z:e>, especially with designer drugs, continues to grow, involving a wide demographic range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, anesthesiologists may be involved in the care of patients under the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> influence of a myriad of substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the usual physiological damage to vital organs (heart, lungs, kidneys, and immune system) new evidence of permanent damage in regions of the brain responsible for memory and pain mediation is emerging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As drug use continues to increase, anesthesiologists must learn to detect drug abusing patients and avoid known interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article will attempt to review the recent literature on this subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Cocaine, marijuana, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, and heroin top the list of abused drugs, alone and in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined effects of these drugs can be synergistic in creating cardiovascular instability and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because combinations create synergy in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transmission, <z:mp ids='MP_0002555'>addiction</z:mp> is possibly faster, more entrenched, and more difficult to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anesthesiologists are now becoming involved in many of the rapid detoxification procedures to combat/treat <z:mp ids='MP_0002555'>addiction</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only limited research has addressed the newer designer drugs, but case reports regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and lethal interactions with commonly used medications such as beta-blockers implicate the need for awareness in anesthesia personnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013146" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Drug abuse</z:e> continues to be a major problem facing our society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anesthesiologists encounter emergency cases in which 'party drugs' have clearly been used, and may also be anesthetizing patients in whom abuse is present but unrecognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Understanding how illicit drugs interact with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agents</z:chebi> is of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
