<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence in temporal lobe resection (TLR) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective cohort study evaluates the incidence of and risk factors for the development of CVS in patients with TLR and AHE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 119 patients were included between 1998 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated by standardized preoperative and postoperative transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) evaluations and neurologic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative CT scans were evaluated by an independent radiologist and the volume of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> within the resection cavity was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 107 patients with longitudinal TCD data, 35 (32.7%) developed postoperative CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CVS did not differ between patients with TLR and AHE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CVS was associated with female gender and a higher <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> volume in the postoperative CT scan (p = 0.035 and 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with CVS showed a significantly higher incidence of postoperative neurologic signs and symptoms (48.6%) compared to patients without CVS (25%, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean length of stay was significantly prolonged in patients with diffuse CVS compared to patients with localized CVS or no CVS (28.8 ± 10.9, 24.2 ± 6.6, and 18.2 ± 6.1 days, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CVS is a frequent complication of surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tle">temporal lobe epilepsy</z:e> irrespective of the resection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Important risk factors for the development of postoperative CVS are female gender and a higher amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the postoperative CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with CVS more frequently have neurologic signs and symptoms resulting in prolonged hospital stay </plain></SENT>
