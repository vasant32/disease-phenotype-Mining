<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to examine the role of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the development of vasospasm and cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured the expression levels of genes and proteins related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) treated with hemolysate and FR167653 (FR) (1 micromol/L), a selective p38MAPK inhibitor, for 48 hours by TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one dogs were assigned to 3 groups of 7 animals: control, placebo, and FR-treated (1 mg/kg/d) groups in a double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects were assessed through the caliber of the basilar artery, and the changes in gene expressions and the activation of p38MAPK were assessed by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of hVSMCs with hemolysate induced significant upregulation of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 gene and protein expressions, which was suppressed significantly with FR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean vessel caliber on day 7, as a percentage of that of day 0, was 49% in the placebo, and 74% in the FR group (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene expression levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 in the arterial wall were extremely elevated in the placebo, and significantly suppressed in the FR group (P=0.0027, 0.0002, and 0.0073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p38MAPK phosphorylation was stimulated in the placebo and hemolysate in vitro, and suppressed in the FR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that p38MAPK is activated in the arterial wall after SAH, leading to the development of vasospasm, possibly through the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
