<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> on the contractile properties of the rat common carotid artery were measured in vitro, and the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> content of these arteries were determined qualitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When carotid artery segments from rats that had been infused with lactated Ringer's solution alone were incubated in the presence of 1 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi>, they exhibited a decrease in contractile activity brought about by the presence of either <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, and an increase in contractile activity when <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes were not witnessed if the arterial segments came from rats that had been infused with lactated Ringer's solution containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">epsilon aminocaproic acid</z:chebi> was found on the median effective dose values for each vasoconstrictor used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence histochemistry showed no qualitative changes in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> content of carotid arteries following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
