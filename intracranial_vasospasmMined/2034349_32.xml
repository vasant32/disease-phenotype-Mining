<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty monkeys were divided into four groups of 5 animals each: 1) a control group of sham-operated animals, 2) animals subjected to angiography 3 days after the induction of SAH (3-day SAH), 3) animals subjected to angiography 7 days after SAH (1-week SAH), and 4) animals subjected to angiography 7 and 14 days after SAH (2-week SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To induce SAH, the main cerebral arteries on the right were dissected free of the arachnoid, and an autologous blood clot was placed around the arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate vasospasm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals underwent a baseline angiogram before SAH; angiography was repeated at different intervals in each group, as outlined above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathological changes and the deposition of the immunoglobulin IgG in the arterial wall were evaluated immunohistochemically in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral arteries on the side of the clot showed evidence of mild vasospasm (-24.6% reduction) on the angiogram performed on Day 3, severe vasospasm (-51.7%) on Day 7, and mild vasospasm (-12.8%) on Day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The infiltration of inflammatory cells was most marked in the spastic arterial wall in the 1-week SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 2-week SAH group, severe myonecrosis and intimal disruption were observed, even in the vessels that showed only mild vasospasm, and the inflammatory reactions had almost abated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
