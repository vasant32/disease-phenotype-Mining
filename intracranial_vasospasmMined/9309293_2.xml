<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to measure the amount of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>-LT in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) in correlation with transcranial Doppler findings (TCD) in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first cisternal CSF-sample which was already collected intra-operatively an initial peak of cys-LT was detected, followed by decreasing amounts of cys-LT during the next 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CSF-levels of immunoreactive cys-LT were significantly higher in those patients who showed signs of vasospasm on transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normalization of TCD values was accompanied by decreasing levels of CSF-cys-LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a significant correlation between the amounts of immunoreactive cys-LT in cerebrospinal fluid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> measured by TCD </plain></SENT>
