<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is complex and multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to identify the degree of correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> as observed angiographically and clinical evaluation of an animal's neurologic status in the canine model following a single and double experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen mongrel dogs underwent single or double experimental SAH by percutaneous needle puncture of the cisterna magna and placement of a subarachnoid blood clot in the basal cistern on day 1 and day 4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 72 h after each experimental SAH, vertebral angiography was performed and compared to control angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery diameter measured at multiple positions was expressed as percentage of control diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation of the animals was performed every day throughout the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess the degree of neurologic impairment we developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale that efficiently estimated motor ability, eye response and eating habits of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasoconstriction after experimental SAH reduced mean basilar artery diameter to 79.1% (+/- 5.4) of control diameter following single SAH and to 69.0% (+/- 2.1) of control diameter following double SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in the neurologic behavior of the animals throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since a principal characteristic of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is the close correlation between arterial constriction and neurological deficit, we believe that the canine model of SAH, although good in creating cerebral arterial vasoconstriction, does not fully represent the best model of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
