<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAH is associated with a number of secondary pathologies, such as: transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, delayed ischemic neuronal deficit (DIND), cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, microcirculatory modifications, microthrombosis and ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available data demonstrate that there are complex interactions among these secondary complications, and NO plays an important role among the interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NO has been implicated to be a crucial molecule in eliminating vasospasm, facilitating neuroprotection, anti-microthrombosis, cerebral ischemic tolerance and promoting endothelial cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, therapeutic agent targeting a key component in the pathopyhysiology of SAH such as NO and its related enzymes would be favorable for future development of SAH drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, because of the complex nature of the secondary complications after SAH, agents with multiple efficacies on these complications, or the combination of several agents such as NO donors, <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> radical scavengers and neuroprotectants might be more desirable </plain></SENT>
