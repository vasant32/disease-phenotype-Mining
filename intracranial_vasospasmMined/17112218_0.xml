<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A protocol of early and aggressive treatment was instituted using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, cerebral angioplasty, and intracranial pressure (ICP) reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient population consisted of 25 women and seven men, whose ages ranged from 34 to 60 years (average 47 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' Hunt and Hess grades on presentation were as follows: Grade 0 (one); Grade I (three); Grade II (two); Grade III (nine); Grade IV (10); Grade V (seven) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsurgical clipping alone was performed in 15 of 32 patients, endosaccular occlusion was performed in 17 of 20 patients, and two patients underwent combined treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent angioplasty was performed in 26 of 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 32 patients underwent treatment of increased ICP with ventriculostomy placement, removal of the bone flap (11), evacuation of associated intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (five), and decompressive obectomy (four) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients survived and 11 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 survivors, seven have returned to work, live independently, and have no neurological deficits; eight require minimal assistance at home; four are in rehabilitation with moderate deficits at 3 months; and two remain in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group of aggressively treated patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> cerebral protection, successful treatment of medically intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was related to time of treatment (&lt; 2 hours), expeditious reduction of elevated ICP, and angioplasty </plain></SENT>
