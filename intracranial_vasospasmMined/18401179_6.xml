<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of this contraction, however, is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smooth muscle contraction is regulated in part by membrane potential, which is determined by K+ conductance in smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Voltage-gated (Kv) and large-conductance, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-activated K+ (BK) channels dominate arterial smooth muscle K+ conductance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospastic smooth muscle cells are depolarized relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, but whether this is due to altered Kv or BK channel function has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study determined if BK channels are altered during vasospasm after SAH in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We first characterized BK channels in basilar-artery smooth muscle using whole-cell patch clamping and single-channel recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Next, we compared BK channel function between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and vasospastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and vasospastic cells in BK current density, kinetics, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> and voltage sensitivity, single-channel conductance or apparent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar-artery myocytes had no, small- or intermediate-conductance, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-activated K+ channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of difference in BK channels between vasospastic and control cells suggests alteration(s) in other K+ channels or other ionic conductances may underlie the membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction observed during vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
