<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A previous study had shown that patients with SAH and vasospasm had a significantly higher incidence of ICs in the blood than patients without vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to study how the IC content varied with time and compare this pattern with the clinical picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients presented clinical or radiological signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> during their hospital stays, whereas 12 patients showed no such signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with vasospasm had a significantly higher amount of ICs in serum than those without vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 37 patients with vasospasm, the changes of IC content during the 1st weeks after SAH correlated well with the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data indicated that a high IC content preceded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm and a low content preceded clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation supports the idea that the presence of ICs might be the cause and not the result of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
