<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Cu-Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) can reduce the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, therefore investigated if vasospasm, can be prevented by a novel, stable, and cell permeable SOD mimetic, MnTBAP [Mn(III) tetrakis (4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30746">benzoic acid</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi>] which permeates the biological membranes and scavenges <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 28 rats (225-250 g) were divided equally into four groups: group 1: control; group 2: SAH only; group 3: SAH plus placebo; and group 4: SAH plus MnTBAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used a double haemorrhage method to produce SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting six hours after SAH, 5 mg/kg MnTBAP (Calbiochem, Darmstadt-Germany; Cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No 475870)) or an equal volume of 0.9% saline (37 degrees C) was administered by intraperitoneal injection twice daily for 5 days to groups 4 and 3 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MnTBAP or 0.9% saline injections were continued up to fifth day after SAH and rats were sacrificed on the fifth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain sections at the level of the pons were examined by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Planimetric measurements were made for the cross-sectional areas of the lumen and the vessel wall (intima plus media) of the basilar artery by a micrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FINDING: Administration of MnTBAP significantly attenuated the vasoconstriction of the basilar artery in group 4 compared with the groups 2 and 3 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that this SOD mimetic (MnTBAP) attenuates delayed cerebral vasoconstriction following experimental SAH and that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi> have a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
