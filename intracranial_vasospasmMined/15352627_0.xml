<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of vasospasm and the outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale; GOS) especially in poor WFNS grade were retrospectively analyzed over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group (pre-group) consisted of 43 patients (grade IV: 31, grade V: 12), who were admitted between 1996 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When vasospasm occurred, they were mainly treated by papaverine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second group (mil-cis group), for the prevention of vasospasm, cisternal irrigation therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> was applied in 24 patients (grade IV: 13, grade V: 11), who were admitted in the period between 1999 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third group, (w/o mil-cis group), consisted of 30 patients (grade IV: 15, grade V: 15), in whom cisternal irrigation therapy was not able to be carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In grade IV, vasospasm was observed in 66% of the patients the first group, 50% in the w/o mil-cis group and significantly less in the mil-cis group (15%, p&lt;0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In grade V, the rate of vasospasm was also lower in the mil-cis group but no statistical significance was revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the rate of favorable outcome in GOS was highest and the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was least in the mil-cis group in both grade IV and V, only the trend was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many factors should be considered, Cisternal irrigation therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> reduced the occurrence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, outcome was not improved because of the initial poor clinical condition </plain></SENT>
