<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to clarify the role of MAPK expression and activation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and to evaluate the therapeutic effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> using an antisense MAPK oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antisense MAPK, sense MAPK, or scrambled ODN was injected into the rats intracisternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> experimental SAH model to assess vasospasm in the basilar arteries at 30 minutes, 1 day, and 2 days after SAH by cross-sectional area measurement and other histological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used to quantify MAPK expression and activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rat SAH model was used to test the effect of post-SAH treatment with antisense MAPK ODN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Antisense MAPK therapy significantly inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> when compared with sense MAPK or scrambled ODN treatment on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry and Western blotting performed in the basilar artery of rats that received antisense MAPK ODN demonstrated inhibition of MAPK and phosphorylated MAPK on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In post-SAH treatment study, antisense ODN reduced MAPK and phosphorylated MAPK in the basilar artery and attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MAPK activation, but not expression, might be implicated with sustained smooth muscle contraction during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that antisense MAPK ODN strategy is an effective treatment against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
