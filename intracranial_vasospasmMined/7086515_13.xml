<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this model, the size of the SAH apparent on the first computerized tomography (CT) scan was correlated with the incidence and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indices monitored for up to 21 days after SAH included cranial CT scan, cerebral blood flow, vessel caliber, and neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 18 monkeys studied for 48 hours or more were divided into two groups according to the size of the SAH on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was more common in the group with large SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this group, on Days 0, 7, and 14, the incidence of vasospasm was significantly higher than at other times (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01, and p less than 0.05, respectively), and the percentage reduction in vessel caliber was significantly greater than in the group with small/medium SAH (Day 7, p less than 0.02; Days 0 and 14, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed neurological deficit developed in two monkeys with large SHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>Apathy</z:hpo> was noted from Day 17 to Day 21 in one, and unsteadiness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo> were noted on Days 4 and 5 in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the incidence, degree, and time course of vasospasm reflected the size of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
