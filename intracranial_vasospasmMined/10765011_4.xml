<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been implicated in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but its role in the physiological regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the relationship between CBF and plasma ET-1 levels in type I diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF was assessed semi-quantitatively by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">99Tc</z:chebi>(m)-hexamethylpropylene-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">99Tc</z:chebi>(m)-HMPAO) single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 50 cerebral "regions of interest" (ROIs) of 19 type I diabetic patients without clinical evidence of cerebral disease, and 10 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both groups, plasma ET-1 levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that type I diabetic patients had significantly more hypoperfusion ROIs than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While up to 68.4% of the type I diabetic patients showed 3 or more hypoperfusion ROIs, only 10% of the control subjects did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma ET-1 levels were lower in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>type I diabetes</z:mp> subgroup with 3 or more hypoperfusion ROIs than in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>type I diabetes</z:mp> subgroup with less than 3 hypoperfusion ROIs and in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an inverse correlation between the number of hypoperfusion ROIs and plasma ET-1 levels (r = 0.47, p = 0.04) was found in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>type I diabetes</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that plasma ET-1 is decreased in type I diabetic patients with subclinical abnormalities of regional CBF assessed by cerebral SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This fact may reflect a compensatory response to the reduction of the brain perfusion in order to prevent ischemic events in these patients </plain></SENT>
