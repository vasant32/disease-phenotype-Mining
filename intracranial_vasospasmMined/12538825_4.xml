<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of papaverine on a rapidly activating delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel (hKv1.5) cloned from human heart and stably expressed in Ltk(-) cells as well as a corresponding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current (the ultrarapid delayed rectifier, I(Kur)) in human atrial myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, we found that papaverine inhibited hKv1.5 current in a time- and voltage-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 43.4 microM at +60 mV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Papaverine accelerated the kinetics of the channel inactivation, suggesting the blockade of open channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Papaverine (100 microM) also blocked I(Kur) in human atrial myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that papaverine blocks hKv1.5 channels and native hKv1.5 channels in a concentration-, voltage-, state-, and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This interaction suggests that papaverine could alter cardiac excitability in vivo </plain></SENT>
