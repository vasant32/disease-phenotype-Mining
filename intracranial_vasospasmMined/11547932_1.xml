<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has become increasingly evident that the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) which described the ischemic consequences of cerebral arterial constriction is complex and multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, numerous investigators have used experimental animal models that resemble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No ideal model for SAH has been found as yet, and hence the quest for such a model continues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed an endoscopic technique that permits a direct vision of internal carotid artery and puncturing the artery to provoke SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model will closely reflect the clinical setting of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH was characterized by a sudden decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) by at least 40% in the first 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following this initial drop, there was an increase in the CBF and the CBV, however, they remained significantly below the base line values, at the end of 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study describes a new model of SAH in rat that simulates the clinical phenomenon of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> that also produces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
