<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has become the most concerning complication in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) seen in the neurosciences intensive care unit (NSICU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic augmentation is frequently used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> from vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the last 5 years, posterior reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (PRES) has been reported in three single case reports as a complication of hemodynamic augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe an additional three patients seen in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Description of clinical course of three patients with a secured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treated with hemodynamic augmentation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified three patients (two female and one male), ranged in age from 62 to 70 years who developed PRES after treatment with induced or permissive arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During their NSICU stay, case 1 had worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, case 2 and 3 had a decline in level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging was compatible with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> characteristic of PRES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure was reduced with a complete clinical and imaging resolution of PRES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PRES can be a cause of deterioration in patients with aSAH treated with hemodynamic augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PRES should be differentiated from evolving infarctions due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations and neuroimaging findings are reversible after gradual normalization of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
