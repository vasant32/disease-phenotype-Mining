<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed in six dogs to obtain baseline measurements of basilar artery diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three dogs <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was created by performing percutaneous puncture of the cisterna magna, and replacing 7 ml of cerebrospinal fluid with 7 ml of arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining three dogs were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily angiography was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs to determine the percent reduction in basilar artery diameter (%RBAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One dog from each group was sacrificed after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining two dogs in each group were sacrificed after 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each basilar artery was perfusion fixed and subjected to histologic, and immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the SAH group, the average %RBAD was 4 (+/- 3) at 24 hours, and 36 (+/- 1) at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the average %RBAD was - 1 (+/- 1) at 24 hours, and 0 (+/- 2) at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endothelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and endothelial expression of ICAM-I were found at 24 hours.At 48 hours post-SAH there was widespread endothelial desquamation, but no evidence of ICAM-I expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the control group, histology was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and no ICAM-I expression was found at 24 or 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that a brief window of therapeutic efficacy exists during the first postictal 24 hours where ICAM-I <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may be useful in suppressing the pathogenesis of PHCV </plain></SENT>
