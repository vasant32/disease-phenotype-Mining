<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured serum concentration of natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and investigated their influence on post-SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 49 patients of SAH, their plasma concentration of the natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>: ANP and brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>: BNP) were measured at the day of ictus and 7th day of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between concentration of natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, severity of SAH, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> and symptomatic vasospasm were elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of ANP did not alter on admission and 7th day post SAH, whereas that of BNP increased in the patients with moribund SAH and those with ruptured A-com <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial increase of BNP following SAH could be attributed to direct damage of SAH on the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>Hyponatremia</z:hpo> and symptomatic vasospasm tended to occur in the patients who had persistent increase of plasma BNP concentration during one week post SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic intervention to maintain normonatremia by fluid-management decreased occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm, even though patients with increased plasma BNP concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It might be concluded that increased secretion of BNP following SAH is caused by direct effect to the hypothalamus and prolonged hyper secretion of BNP resulted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> and exaggerated symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
