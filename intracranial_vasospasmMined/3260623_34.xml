<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular contractions in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (5-hydroxytryptamine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) in rabbit basilar artery were studied in vitro using an isometric tension-measurement technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> (10(-5)M) markedly augmented contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> (10(-9) to 10(-6)M) and slightly augmented those induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (20 to 80 mM) in arteries with intact endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the augmentation induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was almost abolished in arteries that were chemically denuded of endothelial cells by pretreatment with saponin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> is known to be a selective inhibitor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), it is possible that the augmentation of contraction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in endothelium-intact arteries was mediated via an inhibition of spontaneously released EDRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) on spontaneously released EDRF was investigated by injecting 5 ml of blood into the cisterna magna and sacrificing the rabbits 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arteries after SAH showed a significant reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-induced augmentation compared to that seen in control arteries with intact endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that spontaneously released EDRF is significantly reduced after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that EDRF is released spontaneously in the rabbit basilar artery and that inhibition of its release might be involved in pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
