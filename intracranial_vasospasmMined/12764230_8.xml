<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombin is activated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between thrombin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has not yet been fully established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of thrombin as a causative factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and to delineate the signal transduction mechanism that results in thrombin-inducing sustained vasoconstriction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the SAH group, SAH was simulated by the 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rabbit model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group, antithrombin III (AT-III) was injected into the cisterna magna just before production of the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF samples were obtained serially to measure d-dimer with latex photometric immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 4, the basilar artery was excised after perfusion-fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was evaluated by measuring the cross-sectional area of each basilar arterial lumen, and the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the vascular wall was examined with an immunohistochemical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the treatment group, the value of d-dimer on day 4 was 0.83+/-0.07 microg/mL, which was statistically significantly lower than that in the nontreated SAH group (2.49+/-0.09 microg/mL, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of the arterial lumen in the treatment group was 3.67x10(5)+/-1.58x10(4) square pixels, which was statistically significantly larger than that in the nontreated SAH group (2.60x10(5)+/-2.29x10(4) square pixels; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAPK was detected diffusely in the vascular smooth muscle cell layer in the nontreated SAH group, but it was absent in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of thrombin activity leads to amelioration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and suppression of MAPK diphosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that thrombin and its related signal transduction, including the MAPK cascade, appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
