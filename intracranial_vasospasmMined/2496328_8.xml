<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> occurred briefly at the incision in 2 animals; otherwise the clinical condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> throughout the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic fibrinolysis did not occur, and gross and microscopic examination of the brain and meninges revealed no abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, we evaluated the efficacy of unilateral administration of rt-PA suspension (0.5 mg) plus slow-release gel rt-PA (1.25 mg) in lysing a bilateral subarachnoid clot and preventing vasospasm in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen monkeys were divided randomly into 2 equal groups, each of which underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by frontotemporal craniectomy and induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> on the left side and then on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before closure on the right side either rt-PA or an equal volume of placebo was injected into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 7 angiography was repeated, and the animals were killed under anesthesia for necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the animals in the placebo group developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group significant vasospasm occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major right and left-sided anterior cerebral vessels (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No vasospasm occurred in the rt-PA-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whereas gross subarachnoid clot was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals in the placebo group (mean clot weight 1.13 g), only a small fragment of clot was found in a single rt-PA-treated animal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
