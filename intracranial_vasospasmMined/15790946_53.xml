<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess whether <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> reduces the frequency of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (DCI) in patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized within 4 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> therapy consisted of a continuous intravenous dose of 64 mmol/L per day, to be started within 4 days after SAH and continued until 14 days after occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome DCI (defined as the occurrence of a new hypodense lesion on computed tomography compatible with clinical features of DCI) was analyzed according to the "on-treatment" principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the secondary outcome measures "poor outcome" (Rankin &gt;3) and "excellent outcome" (Rankin 0), we used the "intention-to-treat" principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 283 patients were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, the risk reduction for poor outcome was 23% (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A next step should be a phase III trial to confirm the beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> therapy, with poor outcome as primary outcome </plain></SENT>
