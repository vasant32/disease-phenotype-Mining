<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence implicates the potent vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin (ET) in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the authors examined the therapeutic value of blocking the production of ET-1 by inhibiting the conversion of its relatively inactive precursor, Big ET-1, to a physiologically active form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inhibitor of ET-converting enzyme (ECE), CGS 26303, was injected intravenously after inducing SAH in New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injections of CGS 26303 were initiated either 1 hour after SAH (prevention protocol) or 24 hours after SAH (reversal protocol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of three concentrations (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) of CGS 26303 was injected twice daily, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were killed by perfusion fixation 48 hours after SAH occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were removed and sectioned, and their cross-sectional areas were measured in a blind manner by using computer-assisted videomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CGS 26303 attenuated arterial narrowing after SAH in both the prevention and reversal protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of CGS 26303 achieved statistical significance at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dosages in the prevention protocol and at 30 mg/kg in the reversal protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that inhibiting the conversion of Big ET-1 to ET-1 via intravenous administration of an ECE inhibitor can be an effective strategy for limiting angiographic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results demonstrate that treatment with the ECE inhibitor is capable of reducing vasospasm even when initiated after the process of arterial narrowing has begun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the results provide further support for the role of ET in the establishment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ECE inhibitor CGS 26303 thus represents a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
