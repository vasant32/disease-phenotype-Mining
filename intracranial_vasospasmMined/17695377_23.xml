<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal in this study was twofold: first, to describe the prescribing pattern for AEDs in an international study population; and second, to delineate the impact of AEDs on in-hospital complications and outcome in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors examined data collected in 3552 patients with SAH who were entered into four prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted in 162 neurosurgical centers and 21 countries between 1991 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AED use was assessed by study country and center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of AEDs on in-hospital complications and outcome was evaluated using conditional logistic regressions comparing treated and untreated patients within the same study center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">Antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs were used in 65.1% of patients and the prescribing pattern was mainly dependent on the treating physicians: the prevalence of AED use varied dramatically across study country and center (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.22 and 0.66, respectively [p &lt; 0.001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other predictors included younger age, worse neurological grade, and lower systolic blood pressure on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, patients treated with AEDs had odds ratios of 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.10; p = 0.003) for worse outcome based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale; 1.87 (95% CI 1.43-2.44; p &lt; 0.001) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>; 1.61 (95% CI 1.25-2.06; p &lt; 0.001) for neurological deterioration; 1.33 (95% CI 1.01-1.74; p = 0.04) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>; and 1.36 (95% CI 1.03-1.80; p = 0.03) for elevated temperature during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic AED treatment in patients with aneurysmal SAH is common, follows an arbitrary prescribing pattern, and is associated with increased in-hospital complications and worse outcome </plain></SENT>
