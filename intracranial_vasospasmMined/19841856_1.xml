<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is likely to be multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong evidence has indicated that decreasing levels of NO after SAH seem to be important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A PDE-V inhibitor, tadalafil, theoretically increases NO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study investigated the vasodilatory efficacy of tadalafil on the cerebral arteries with measurement of basilar artery diameters on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used 42 male Wistar-<z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>Albino</z:mp> rats to test our hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were assigned randomly into the following seven groups: group 1: control (only saline), group 2: SAH only (killed on day 2), group 3: SAH + tadalafil (killed on day 2), group 4: SAH only (killed on day 4), group 5: SAH + tadalafil (killed on day 4), group 6: saline + tadalafil (killed on day 2) and group 7: saline + tadalafil (killed on day 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three different parts of basilar artery diameters were measured angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the SAH and SAH groups treated with tadalafil at days 2 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison between control and tadalafil groups showed no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result indicated that tadalafil has a vasodilatory effect on vasoconstricted arteries, but no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study results showed that tadalafil has a vasodilatory effect on both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also concluded that cerebral angiography can be used safely for investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in animal studies </plain></SENT>
