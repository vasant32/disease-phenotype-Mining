<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present experiments were designed to elucidate whether such a mechanism might be involved in the morphological changes observed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm was induced in male Wistar rats by an injection of autologous blood (100 microliters) in the cisterna magna followed by a second injection 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was verified by pressure controlled internal carotid angiography after retrograde cannulation of the external carotid artery 7 days after the second injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were then perfusion fixed and the brains removed for immunohistochemical assessment of nitrotyrosine, the peroxidation product of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> with tyrosine contained in tissue proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining for nitrotyrosine was quantified by microscopy in 40 microns coronal floating sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brains of rats with angiographic vasospasm revealed nitrotyrosine predominantly located with a perivascular distribution and in the pia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that peroxidation of membrane proteins by the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> metabolite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> may contribute to the morphological damage evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
