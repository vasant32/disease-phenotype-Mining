<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 145 patients with IC-PC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent endovascular embolization through the microcatheter under digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 145 cases, 55 patients with 62 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were embolized by mechanical detachable spiral (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 90 patients with 106 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were embolized by Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) or electrical detachable coil (<z:chebi fb="107" ids="27789">EDC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 168 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 145 patients, 96 of which with 100% embolization, 45 with 95% embolization, 15 with 90% embolization, and 12 with less than 90% embolization, were embolized successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture occurred in 3 cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in 5, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>118 cases were cured, 23 improved, and 3 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>17 patients were followed-up by DSA, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> recurred and 2 were totally embolized with <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27789">EDC</z:chebi> for the second time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular embolization is a safe and effective therapeutic method for IC-PC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
