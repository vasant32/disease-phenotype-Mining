<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To prevent symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we have used <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546817" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypervolaemia</z:e> (HV) or volume expansion in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these patients we could not perform effective fluid and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (Na) replacement because of rapid and overwhelming water and Na loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although this phenomenon is characteristic under hypervolaemic states, we regard it important to elucidate the mechanism underlying initiation of vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with aneurysmal SAH, operated on within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, were analysed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected 17 patients in good pre-operative condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravascular volume expansion was accomplished with plasma fractionate or albumin and crystalloid solutions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We divided the 17 patients into two groups; symptomatic spasm group (S-group) consisting of 4 cases developing transient ischaemic symptoms and non-symptomatic spasm group (NS-group) consisting of 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In S-group, rapid and marked <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> developed characteristically before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischaemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences in daily Na balance between the two groups were significant on the 3rd and 5th days (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean cumulative Na balance in S-group during the 10 days of the study (-375 +/- 159 mEg) was higher than that of NS-group (-24.4 +/- 225 mEq) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rapid <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> preceded the development of ischaemic symptoms, and was important as a trigger for symptomatic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We considered that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hormonal disorders</z:e> were implicated in this phenomenon, and atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP), antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> were each measured three times during the period, with no significant differences, found between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It was speculated that another potent natriuretic factor, similar to ANP, induced a rapid selective <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> resulting in symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
