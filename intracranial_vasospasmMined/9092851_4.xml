<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study how neuronal cells are affected by development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), the changes in neuronal metabolites during development of vasospasm were evaluated by in vivo localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH was produced by introduction of a blood clot around the right middle cerebral artery and the right side of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRS experiments were performed before SAH and on Days 7 and 14 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multislice magnetic resonance images were obtained to locate the volume of interest (1.0 cm3) in the bilateral parietal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peak areas for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> compounds, the sum of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and phosphocreatine, and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiograms revealed approximately 50% reduction of vessel caliber for the right main cerebral arteries on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging revealed no apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, even in the spasm-side hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRS revealed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) reduction of the N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and phosphocreatine ratio on Days 7 and 14 and a significant increase in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and phosphocreatine ratio on Day 7, in the spasm-side parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the sham-operated animals, there were no significant changes in these ratios in the bilateral parietal region on Days 7 and 14 after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH caused ischemic injury in a subpopulation of neuronal cells, even when no apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proton MRS may be useful to evaluate how neuronal cells are affected by the ischemic insult during development of vasospasm in clinical situations </plain></SENT>
