<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments in animals and research in humans have demonstrated increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF), and different theories have been tried to explain these observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there are many claims of circulatory improvements in these circumstances, no clinical application has yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete understanding of physiological and anatomic correlation between CBF modulation and SCS remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We strongly believe that the main objective is not to treat vasospasm by increasing blood flow but to prevent vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries by a functional sympathectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SCS may, at least theoretically, work in different ways at the same time: (1) preventing vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries by functional sympathectomy, acting at the lower cervical levels; and (2) increasing CBF through central pathways, perhaps involving brainstem connections, at the upper cervical levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the practical implications of this hypothesis would be differential placement of cervical spinal cord stimulation electrodes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> depending on the timing of electrode insertion and presence or absence of vasospasm at the time of initial intervention </plain></SENT>
