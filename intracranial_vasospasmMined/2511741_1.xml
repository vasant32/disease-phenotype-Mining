<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy of the middle cerebral artery from cats exposed to subarachnoid injection of blood 3 and 7 days before, showed several damage of the vascular ultrastructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intima was thickened with swelling and vacuolization of endothelial cells, with a plump appearance and disruption of tight junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cellular surface was corrugated and the subendothelial space contained proliferating and vacuolated smooth muscle cells capped by elastin and collagen fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The internal elastic lamina was also corrugated and disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adventitial changes were axonic cytoplasmic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling, virtual absence of synaptic vesicles, and disruption of the outer axonal membrane, suggesting denervation of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With administration of 6-hydroxy-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (6-OHDA), similar ultrastructural changes were observed in the adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that denervation induced by subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> could be involved in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, but not 6-OHDA, affects also intima and tunica media, suggesting other mechanisms, in addition to denervation, can participate in the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
