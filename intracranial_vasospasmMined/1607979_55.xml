<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in plasma of patients with SAH were highly elevated during the whole study period, while the levels in CSF of the same patients were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in patients with SAH classified as Fisher computerized tomography (CT) Group 3 were higher than those in patients with SAH classified as Fisher CT Groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in plasma ET-1-like immunoactivity levels between the patient groups stratified by Hunt and Kosnik grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this series, plasma ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in the 12 patients with vasospasm were higher than those in the 15 patients without vasospasm during the 1st week; CSF ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in patients with vasospasm were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range on Days 0 to 3 after SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, then became elevated on Days 5 to 7 and remained high until the end of the 2nd week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CSF ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in patients without vasospasm were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range during the entire period of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time course of the occurrence of vasospasm and that of the increase in CSF ET-1-like immunoactivity coincided precisely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible role of endogenous ET-1 in the pathogenesis of vasospasm due to SAH is discussed </plain></SENT>
