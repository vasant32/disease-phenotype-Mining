<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared outcomes between endovascular coiling versus surgical clipping to treat patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (&lt; 72 h) aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with aSAH were randomized to receive endovascular or surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent clinical assessments, angiography and brain computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 186 patients were analysed: 94 in the endovascular group and 92 in the surgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographics and severity of aSAH were comparable between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasospasm, cerebral</z:e> infarction and complete occlusion were significantly lower in the endovascular coiling group than in the surgical clipping group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good clinical recovery 12 months after aSAH was seen in 75.0% and 69.7% of surviving patients in the endovascular versus coiling group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, coiling yielded less symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasospasm, cerebral</z:e> infarction and complete occlusion than surgical clipping, with no between-group differences in clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
