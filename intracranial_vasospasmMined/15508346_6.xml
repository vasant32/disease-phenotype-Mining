<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were clipped or embolized within 72 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inlet and outlet tubes were placed in either the supratentorial cisternal space, lateral ventricle, or spinal subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lactated Ringer solution containing urokinase (120 IU/ml), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> (3.5 mg/ml), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> (3.6 microg/ml) was continuously infused at 30 ml/hr for as long as 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographical vasospasm was detected in only two of the 11 patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> irrigation and underwent postoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm may have resulted from irrigation obstruction associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumocephalus</z:e> in one patient and clot in the sylvian fissure in the other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> irrigation therapy was significantly better than that of the conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that cisternal irrigation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> is safe and effective, and reduces the occurrence of vasospasm in patients with poor grade aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
