<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and microvasculature in the hypothalamus and brain stem, colloidal carbon was infused into the vertebral artery at various time intervals after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments which demonstrated vasospasm on angiogram were always accompanied by ischaemic changes in serial sections taken from the anterior hypothalamus to the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, when it was demonstrated by angiography that the vasospasm had disappeared, the micro-circulation was restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of the hypothalamus 48 hours and one week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, demonstrated swelling of the endothelial cells, enlargement of the perivascular glia and increase in number of the pinocytic vesicles in the cytoplasm, thus showing vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that in addition to the vasogenic substance in extravasated blood, changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> of cerebral vessels through the vasomotor pathways in the hypothalamus and brain stem might play an important role in the production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
