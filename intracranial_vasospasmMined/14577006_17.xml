<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) is a potent natriuretic factor responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> observed in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through its systemic effects (reduction of blood volume and blood pressure) BNP may augment cerebral blood flow reduction and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> secondary to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between BNP plasma concentration during the first 12 days following SAH and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors propose a hypothesis for the role played by natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> based on the present findings and review the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty eight patients with spontaneous SAH were prospectively included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BNP plasma concentrations were assessed at four different time periods following SAH (day 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCD evidence of CVS was found in 26 patients (68.5%), fourteen patients (36.8%) had delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Initial BNP plasma concentrations were significantly more elevated in patients who eventually did not develop DIND (95.07+/-107.65 pg/ml vs. 25.81+/-22.57 pg/ml, p=0.0053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with DIND, the BNP plasma concentration increased by 3.69 ( p&lt;0.05), 5.89 ( p&lt;0.001) and 4.54 fold ( p&lt;0.001) between days 1-3 to days 4-6, 7-9 and 10-12 respectively (day 1 was regarded as the day of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients without CVS or asymptomatic CVS the BNP plasma concentration decreased between days 1-3 to day 10-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A similar trend in BNP plasma concentration was found in patients with severe SAH (Fisher's score 3-4) as compared with patients with non visible or moderate SAH (BNP concentration ratio day 7-9/1-3: 4.37 vs. 0.75, p=0.015; day 10-12/1-3: 3.37 vs. 0.3, p=0.0144) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The trend in BNP plasma concentration between day 1-3 to day 7-9 was found to correlate with CVS severity with an average increase of 2.01, 3.8 and 5.44 fold for mild, moderate and severe VS respectively ( p&lt;0.01, r=0.4174) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that BNP secretion in SAH patients is closely related to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> intensity and vasospasm severity as well as to development of DIND with a progressive and marked increase during the clinical course in patients who eventually develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taken together the local and systemic effects of BNP on CBF suggest that BNP might play a role in the pathophysiology of CVS through its systemic effects on blood pressure and plasma volume BNP leading to an aggravation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> secondary to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
