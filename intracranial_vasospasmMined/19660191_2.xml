<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively review the incidence of clinically relevant vasospasm in patients treated or not with continuous <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patient records in Albany Medical Center with the diagnosis of SAH between January 1999 and June 2004 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented to the emergency department within 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were entered in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were defined as in clinical vasospasm if there was an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological change in association with abnormal trancranial Doppler (TCD), CT angiogram (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> was infused in 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared with patients who did not receive MgSO(4), there was a statistically significant lower incidence of clinical and radiological vasospasm in those who had the continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between patients who were coiled or clipped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> infusion for the management of clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is safe and reduces the incidence of clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Large, multicenter, controlled studies should be performed in order to determine the true effectiveness of the treatment in a controlled setting </plain></SENT>
