<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) is a potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> that is normally released by trigeminal sensory fibers but depleted following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose that intranasal application may be an effective way to deliver CGRP to the brain and ameliorate vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we intranasally applied CGRP to rats and induced SAH by double-injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to intravenous injection, intranasal delivery led to a 10-fold higher level of CGRP in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intranasal CGRP significantly ameliorated vasospasm, improved cerebral blood flow, and reduced cortical and endothelial cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CGRP increased the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and stimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our data demonstrate that intranasal CGRP delivery is a promising method for moderating vasospasm and reducing the associated ischemic brain injury after SAH in rats, and suggest that it may be a potential approach in clinic </plain></SENT>
