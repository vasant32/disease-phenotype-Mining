<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) have been associated with cardiac dysfunction and adverse neurological outcomes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether elevated levels of BNP are independently associated with radiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma BNP levels were measured after admission, a mean of 5.5 ± 3.0 days after SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was determined by retrospective review of computerized tomography (CT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was confirmed by the presence of vascular narrowing on cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between BNP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was quantified using multivariable logistic regression and reverse stepwise elimination of clinical covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A stratified analysis was performed to quantify the association between BNP levels and infarction in patients with and without angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BNP levels were measured from 119 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median BNP level was 105 pg/ml (interquartile range 37-275 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our multivariable model, the top quartile of BNP levels (≥ 276 pg/ml) were associated with an increased odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (OR 4.2, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The stratified analysis showed that the association between BNP and infarction was strongest in patients without angiographic vasospasm (OR 7.8, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of BNP are strongly and independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and the association is most pronounced in patients without angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results provide further evidence that other mechanisms can contribute to infarction, and BNP may be a useful biomarker in detecting patients at risk for adverse outcomes without large vessel vasospasm </plain></SENT>
