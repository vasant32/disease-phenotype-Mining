<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether extraluminally applied OxyHb influenced vascular responses to intraluminally applied vasoactive agents in isolated, perfused, canine basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The steel cannula insertion method was used to examine vascular responses to intraluminally applied 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48292">5-carboxamidotryptamine</z:chebi> (selective for 5-HT1 receptors), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48295">alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine</z:chebi> (selective for 5-HT2 receptors), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, before and after extraluminal treatment with OxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extraluminal application of 2.5 x 10(-5) mol/L OxyHb immediately induced a transient elevation of the basal perfusion pressure, which gradually decreased and then stabilized at a level slightly higher than the control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35941">5-HT agonist</z:chebi> induced dose-dependent vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potencies of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> were not very different, but the efficacies varied, i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48295">alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine</z:chebi> &gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> &gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48292">5-carboxamidotryptamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each response was strongly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> (a selective 5-HT2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>), indicating that each <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> induces vasoconstriction mediated by 5-HT2 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstriction in response to each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> was consistently potentiated by treatment with OxyHb (2.5 x 10(-5) mol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-induced constrictions after OxyHb treatment were much more markedly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi>, compared with those before OxyHb treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced constrictions were enhanced by OxyHb, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-induced constrictions were significantly decreased by OxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is suggested that OxyHb enhancement of constrictions in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may be mediated by increased sensitivity of 5-HT2 receptors, in addition to actions in the endothelium, in canine basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This potentiated vasoconstrictor mechanism may be partially implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
