<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because previous studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> (PGs) are involved in the contraction of cerebral arteries, the present study was undertaken to assess the direct effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, the precursor of PGs, on isolated dog basilar arteries and to ascertain the actions of three <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitors, aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, and meclofenamate, on contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> of diverse chemical structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">Arachidonic acid</z:chebi> induced sustained contractions and in optimal concentrations produced constriction that was 56% as great as that produced by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These responses were markedly inhibited (95%) by meclofenamate (10(-5) M), but aspirin (10(-3) M) had no such effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this concentration of meclofenamate reduced resting tension and inhibited by 16% the optimal responses caused by PGF2 alpha, while having no significant effect on <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher doses of meclofenamate (10(-4) M, 10(-3) M) produced increasing degrees of inhibition of contractions caused by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> or PGF2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, aspirin had no effect on PGF2 alpha contractions and slightly enhanced <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> resembled those of meclofenamate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show clearly that different <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitors have different effects on cerebral vasomotion in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aspirin, known to inhibit platelet function markedly, seems to have little effect on isolated vascular smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the pharmacodynamic effects of meclofenamate and some related drugs may afford a new approach in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
