<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no close relationship between vasoconstrictor activity in postoperative CSF samples and the patient's clinical condition or angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identity of the vasoconstrictor substance(s) in CSF was not established, but <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> were eliminated as prime <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50514">vasoconstrictor agents</z:chebi> inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in the temporal profile of the responses of isolated tissues to CSF from patients with early and late surgery suggested that differing substances were involved in the production of spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A correlation between CSF <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> concentrations and vasoactive substances was found, but <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> could not account for vasoconstrictor activity of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A log:linear correlation between total vasoconstrictor activity and total CSF collected could not be explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, because of possible differences in the identity of vasoactive substances in CSF in this study compared to earlier studies, clinical comparisons based on apparent differences in pharmacological potency of CSF were not warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, removal of subarachnoid blood by cisternal rinsing seemed to be a useful surgical adjunct </plain></SENT>
