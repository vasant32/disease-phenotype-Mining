<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the observed mortality associated with this drug warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish a maximum tolerable dose, this study evaluated the toxicity of DETA/NO released from EVAc in a dose-escalation series in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DETA/NO was incorporated into EVAc at a 20:80 dry weight ratio (DETA/NO:EVAc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 animals underwent a right frontotemporal craniotomy for placement of a single polymer delivering no drug (n = 3), 0.5 +/- 0.1 mg/kg (n = 3), 0.9 +/- 0.1 mg/kg (n = 3), 1.9 +/- 0.2 mg/kg (n = 3), or a 3.2 mg/kg dose (n = 1) into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The animal receiving the highest dose of DETA/NO (3.2 mg/kg) died 46 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining animals survived for the planned duration of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One animal in the group receiving the 1.9 mg/kg dose experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> 25 hours after surgery and remained lethargic for 2 days before making a complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining animals exhibited no adverse behavioral effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of brain tissue revealed hemorrhagic and ischemic changes at doses above 0.9 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No evidence of vascular wall pathology or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was observed in any animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The greatest amount of DETA/NO safely delivered from EVAc <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> to the subarachnoid space of the cynomolgus monkey is approximately 1.0 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings show that continuous intracisternal delivery of DETA/NO is a safe and potentially effective strategy for prophylactic treatment of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
