<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While endothelium-dependent vasoconstriction is preserved, decreased levels of NO inhibit endothelium-dependent relaxation and may cause vasospasm </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors' aim was to determine whether S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a stable S-nitrosothiol compound, could reverse vasospasm in an experimental vasospasm model in rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was induced in 37 New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control (no SAH), SAH only, SAH plus saline and SAH plus SNAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SNAP (15 micrograms/kg/min) or 0.09% saline (equal volume) was infused 46 hours after induction of SAH </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were removed, sectioned and their cross sectional areas were evaluated in a blind manner, by light microscopy and by using computer assisted morphometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH elicited vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals of SAH only and SAH plus saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with SNAP, arterial narrowing was markedly attenuated without producing systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
