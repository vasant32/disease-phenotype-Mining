<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A simple and inexpensive experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was developed in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on accumulating data indicating the important role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites in the etiology of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we investigated changes induced by SAH on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>), F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAH was produced by the cisternal injection of blood via percutaneous suboccipital puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH rats (n = 200) were injected with 300 microliters of fresh autologous arterial blood; Control rats (n = 100) received the same volume of mock CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 60 additional animals, no injections were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To follow the changes induced by SAH on both the spectrum and time course of CSF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi>, cisternal CSF samples were collected under basal conditions, 6, 12, and 36 after cisternal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>, PGF2 alpha, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> were assayed in aliquots of CSF obtained by pooling samples from each experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">Eicosanoids</z:chebi> were assayed using radioimmunoassay techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial spasm was verified in parallel groups of SAH and control rats by comparison of the angiographic diameters of the basilar arteries (BA) and middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) to that of the stapedial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> were significantly higher in the SAH groups compared to both noninjected and mock-CSF injected control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These increases in concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> were accompanied by a decrease in the mean vascular diameter (77.5-82.0% of control) on day 2 following cisternal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that marked elevations of spasmogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> in the CSF are associated with experimental SAH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
