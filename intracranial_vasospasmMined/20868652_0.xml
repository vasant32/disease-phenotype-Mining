<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE protein, APOE gene) gene polymorphism is associated with prognosis of patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to investigate the association of promoter polymorphism of APOE with CV in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and one patients with spontaneous SAH were involved in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous blood samples were collected to identify the promoter genotype of APOE by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CV was judged by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) combined with patients' condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations of APOE promoter polymorphism with CV after SAH were analyzed by Ï‡(2) test, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 101 patients, 42 of 87 patients (48.3%) with promoter -219T allele showed CV, which was significantly different from those with -219G allele (23/61, 37.7%, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses also showed that promoter -219T was a risk factor to predispose CV after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant association between promoter -491A/T (rs#449647) or -427C/T (rs#769446) polymorphisms and SAH induced CV (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our finding suggests that patients with APOE -219T promoter are apt to CV after spontaneous SAH </plain></SENT>
