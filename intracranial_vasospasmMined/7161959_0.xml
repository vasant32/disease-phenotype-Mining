<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Rhesus monkeys, the common carotid and internal carotid blood flow were measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diltiazem (10-300 micrograms/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently increased both the common carotid and internal carotid blood flow, and the increase in internal carotid blood flow persisted for a longer period than that in the common carotid blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In dogs, regional blood flow in the cerebral cortex (rCBF) was measured by means of the hydrogen gas clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diltiazem (20 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) increased rCBF by about 20% of the control during the infusion, and the increase in rCBF was still continued 40 min after the infusion was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cats, the basilar artery was exposed by craniotomy through the transcervico-transclival approach, and vasospasm was induced by topical administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, PGF2 alpha and incubated blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diltiazem, either applied topically to the artery (100 micrograms/ml) or infused continuously into the femoral vein (20 or 40 micrograms/kg/min), suppressed the vasoconstriction evoked by the spasmogen </plain></SENT>
