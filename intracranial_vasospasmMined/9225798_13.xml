<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently proposed a simplified technique for measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using the [123I]N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) autoradiographic (ARG) method with SPECT (the <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-ARG method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of rCBF and the reproducibility and sensitivity to hypoperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients using this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using a standard arterial input, a single static scan, a fixed distribution volume (Vd) and one-point arterial blood sampling, we measured rCBF in 39 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (19 men and 20 women; mean ages 61 +/- 11 yr for the men and 60 +/- 12 yr for the women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen neurologically stable patients with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (mean age = 65 +/- 11 yr) were studied twice at a mean interval of 97 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients (7 men and 9 women, mean age = 63 +/- 5 yr) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, rCBF was measured 1-2 wk after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was evaluated by repeated angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean rCBF in the vasospastic area was compared with that in a nonvasospastic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean rCBFs of the cerebral cortex and centrum semiovale in the volunteers were 33.0 +/- 5.1 ml/100 g/min and 25.0 +/- 4.5 ml/100 g/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no age-dependent change in rCBF, but the women showed significantly higher cortical rCBF than the men (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, the whole-brain CBF values showed high reproducibility, with high correlations between those obtained at the first and second studies (y = -3.5 + 1.03x; r = 0.90; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients, the vasospastic area showed significantly lower rCBF than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortical rCBF (p &lt; 0.01) and the nonvasospastic area (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain regions with rCBF levels below 20 ml/100 g/min showed infarction on the follow-up CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-ARG method is reproducible, sensitive to hypoperfusion and feasible for the quantitative evaluation of rCBF in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
