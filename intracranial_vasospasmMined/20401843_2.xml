<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditional research and treatment has focused on addressing the delayed events of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the physiological and cellular events of early brain injury (EBI) make significant contributions to patient outcomes and may even be a more significant factor than delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBI is the result of physiological derangements such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP), decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF), and global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which results in blood brain barrier dysfunction, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and oxidative cascades that lead to neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consequence of these events to the patient is often <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or significant neurological disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The link between EBI and outcome has come under intense focus with recent studies failing to show improved outcomes following significant inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and research into the inhibition of EBI cascades is being perused as an effective means of treating SAH patients </plain></SENT>
