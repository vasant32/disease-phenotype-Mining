<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results on discharge were as follows: 543 cases, excellent; 186, good; 117, fair; 93, poor; and 61, dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About three-fourths of the cases except for 23 cases of vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> showed either excellent or good result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate became worse with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results fairly correlated with the preoperative grades by Hunt and Hess (1968), but the cases of Grade Ia were unexpectedly worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The timing of operation influenced the mortality rate; especially, the cases operated within 3 to 7 days following the last <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> bore poor results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies revealed that excellent and good cases increased and poor cases decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate for each year decreased annually to 2% in 1975 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This improvement may be attributed to the advancement in the operative management with supplementary procedures and in the treatment for cerebral angiospasms and general condition </plain></SENT>
