<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Superficial temporal artery (STA) pseudoaneurysm after a craniotomy is very rare with only five cases reported in the literature, none manifesting in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> treatment with triple H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old male was admitted after a syncopal episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging documented a ruptured anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was taken to the operating room for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, but the procedure was aborted due to intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> re-rupture, at which point the patient underwent emergent coil embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was complicated by severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> requiring prolonged triple H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 22, a growing left temporal mass with a bruit was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The suspected diagnosis of STA pseudoaneurysm was confirmed by femoral angiography, and it was treated with coils and Onyx embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a postcraniotomy STA pseudoaneurysm in the setting of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascular embolization is a viable option for the treatment of an STA pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
