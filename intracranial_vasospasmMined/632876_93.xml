<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From a larger series of autopsies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), 20 cases were selected for the known complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence for vasospasm was radiological and pathological in 17 cases and pathological alone in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic histological examination of the large arteries in places known formerly to have been in spasm showed that, in the 12 early cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before 3 weeks), there were relevant changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the layers of the arterial wall, the most significant being evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the eight late cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after 3 weeks), in addition to the sequelae of the earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes, there was marked concentric intimal thickening by subendothelial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, again located in the segments of arteries formerly in spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes were also found in the small arteries, capillaries, and veins, both in the early and late cases but these changes, although striking, were thought to be caused by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to the vasospasm; similar changes were also seen in the control cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> from <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
