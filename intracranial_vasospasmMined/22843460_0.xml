<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is designed to see the difference of moderate or aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> supported with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in symptomatic vasospasm detected with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL and METHODS: Fifty eight patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping and were admitted to the neurointensive care unit were treated with normovolemia and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n=35) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> supported with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n=23) targeting a mean arterial pressure of 110-130 mm Hg and central venous pressure of 8-12 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daily TCD, fluid intake, fluid balance and haemodynamic values were recorded for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences detected in mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, hematocrit values, fluid balance and middle cerebral artery flow velocities between the two groups through 14 days (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>Hyponatremia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were observed as complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>Hypervolemia</z:hpo> adds no benefit compared to normovolemia in the treatment of vasospasm occurred as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
