<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSF from SAH patients suffering from delayed ischaemic neurological deficits due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can generate near maximal force in vitro and previous experiments have ascribed this generation of force to be a calcium mediated event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intracellular calcium concentration has been demonstrated to rise during the vasospastic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calcium also stimulates oxidative metabolism as does <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>), the product of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) hydrolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant alteration in high energy metabolites such as ATP, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and phosphocreatine have also been demonstrated in various models of SAH mediated vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular smooth muscle predominantly uses oxidative metabolism for force generation and reserves glycolytic metabolism for ion homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decrease in oxidative metabolism during force generation would imply failing mitochondria and increased glycolytic high-energy phosphate supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased oxidative metabolism would imply a decreased efficiency of the contractile apparatus or mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to see if SAH CSF stimulation of porcine carotid artery oxidative metabolism was altered during force generation when compared with incremental calcium stimulation with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> depolarisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF from patients (n = 10) who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> stimulated force generation but with a significant 'right shift' in oxygen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This 'right shift' is indicative of an increased energy cost for contractile work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that vascular smooth muscle contractile apparatus, when stimulated by subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid, is consuming excess <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> during force generation </plain></SENT>
