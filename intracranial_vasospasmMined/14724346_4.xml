<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at investigating the effects of extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and microcirculatory perfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An endovascular piercing method was used to induce Wistar rat SAH models, and animals were divided into sham-operated, vehicle controls, and EGb-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EGb was injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes before operation and was repeated every 6 hours, with a single dose of 15 mg/kg bw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diameters of basilar arteries before and after operation were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microcirculatory blood perfusion of parietal lobe cortex was detected using a laser Doppler flow-meter probe within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 levels in both plasma and brain tissue were detected at different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that SAH caused an immediate drop in microcirculatory blood flow in vehicle controls, which persisted for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 levels in both plasma and brain tissue increased after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGb partly reversed spasms of the basilar artery and antagonized a drop in microcirculatory blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EGb also prevented an increase in endothelin-1 both in plasma and in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, EGb, by antagonizing the overproduction of endo- thelin-1, partly reverses <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and improves microcirculation, and thus relieves secondary ischemic brain injury after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
