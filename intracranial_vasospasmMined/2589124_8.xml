<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural studies incorporating different forms of microscopic observations of the endothelium after SAH representing a prerequisite for further investigations on the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experimental study was performed in order to investigate and define more precisely the pathomorphological changes at the endothelial surface of the basilar artery of dogs after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two separate injections of autologous blood into the cisterna magna within 72 hours resulted in extensive angiographic narrowing of the diameter of the basilar artery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological studies of the basilar artery including light microscopic, transmission electron microscopic, scanning electron microscopic and freeze cracking microscopic examinations demonstrated severe pathomorphological changes at the endothelial surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These consisted mainly of infolding and corrugation of the endothelium, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> and desquamation of endothelial cells as well as of vacuolation and ingrowth of fibrous tissue between the endothelial and muscular layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No pathomorphological changes could be observed in the muscular layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the described post-haemorrhagic ultrastructural changes of the endothelium cerebral vessels in spasm are likely to represent the morphological basis of the delayed form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> future research on its pathogenesis should primarily focus on the structural and biochemical taking place at the endothelial surface of the cerebral vasculature after SAH </plain></SENT>
