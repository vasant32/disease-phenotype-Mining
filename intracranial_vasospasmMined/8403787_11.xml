<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">Magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi>) has been used for many years in the prevention of eclamptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, but its mechanism of action has never been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is an important feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and we have developed and tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> can reverse cerebral vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were performed in conscious, male Long Evans rats with pulsed Doppler probes sutured around both common carotid arteries after the external carotid artery had been ligated on the left, thus allowing simultaneous measurement of changes in common and internal carotid blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravascular catheters were placed in the abdominal aorta for measurement of systemic blood pressure and in the right jugular vein for administration of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure and mean Doppler shift signals were used to calculate percentage changes in common and internal carotid vascular conductance </plain></SENT>
