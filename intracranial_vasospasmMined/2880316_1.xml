<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients admitted after the 6th day of SAH, patients with SAH but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on the angiogram and patients in Grade V were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality in 30 patients of Grades I-II was 3.3%, in 31 patients of Grades III-IV 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the latter group 1 patient died due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient vasospasm occurred in 2 patients of Grades I-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recovery was complete in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was 4.9%, the incidence of poor-outcome-vasospasm even only 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The syndrome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> seems to be more than only constriction of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The deleterious effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> shift into vascular cells and into neural cells which causes irreversible damage are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early administration of a specific 'cerebral' calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> like Nimodipine after SAH will prevent the intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> overloading, thus protecting the neural cells and preventing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-induced smooth-muscle contraction of cerebral vessels, which encourages ischaemic deficits after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The preventive use of Nimodipine has markedly reduced the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in our clinic </plain></SENT>
