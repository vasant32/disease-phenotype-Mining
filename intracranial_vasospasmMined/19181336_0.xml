<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our previous study showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) and an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A(2A) receptor (AR-A(2A)) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> could attenuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> via preventing the augmentation of iNOS expression and preserving the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tests the hypothesis that E2 attenuates SAH-induced vasospasm and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by activating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> AR-A(2A) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and by altering antiapoptotic and proapoptotic protein expression (Bcl-2 and Bax, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> SAH model in rat was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with E2 with or without a nonselective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (ICI182,780) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cross sectional areas of the basilar artery and terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) were used to determine the degree of vasospasm and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, AR-A(2A), and ERK1/2 in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and dentate gyrus were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: E2 significantly attenuated vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the first SAH, TUNEL scores were significantly increased, and protein levels of AR-A(2A), ERK1/2, and Bcl-2 were significantly decreased in the dentate gyrus only but not in the cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes were reversed by E2 while ICI182,780 abrogated the antiapoptotic and anti-spastic effects of E2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of Bax did not change in the dentate gyrus after SAH with or without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulated AR-A(2A) and ERK may play a role in vasospasm and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of E2 in the attenuating SAH-induced vasospasm and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may be due to an increased expression of AR-A(2A) and ERK via ER-dependent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data may support further investigation of E2 in the treatment of SAH in humans </plain></SENT>
