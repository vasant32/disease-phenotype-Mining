<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 cases were graded Group 3 according to the classification of Fisher and associates, and the CT number (Hounsfield number) of the subarachnoid clot was over 75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After clipping the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and removing the clot, three cisternal drainage catheters were inserted into both sylvian cisterns and the prepontine cistern, and continuous ventricular drainage was performed routinely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, tPA (0.5 mg/2.5 ml) was infused as a bolus into both basal cisterns and the lateral ventricle twice daily for about 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography and cerebral blood flow studies using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography were performed on Day 4 or 5 and between Days 7 and 10 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, there have been no cases that have shown angiographic vasospasm or delayed ischemic neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study indicates that the intrathecal bolus injection of tPA produces a marked effect on vasospasm </plain></SENT>
