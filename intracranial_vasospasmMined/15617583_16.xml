<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (VSP) is one of the most important risk factors for the development of a delayed neurological deficit after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (pwMRI) provides the possibility of detecting tissue at risk for infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of pwMRI in the management of SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a consecutive series of 180 patients experiencing SAH and treated at our institution over a 3-year period, we identified 20 who underwent pwMRI during their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these 20 patients, the results of pwMRI were compared with the results of diffusion-weighted MRI, transcranial Doppler sonography, and neurological examinations performed at the same time and with repeated pwMRI examinations of the same patient at different times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 patients showed perfusion changes predominantly in the time maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 19 patients with changes in pwMRI had a neurological deficit at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 15 patients with neurological deterioration, transcranial Doppler sonography showed signs of VSP, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients showed alterations in pwMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The areas of perfusion changes in pwMRI correlated well with the neurological deficits of the patients and were larger than the areas of changed diffusion in diffusion-weighted MRI performed at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no clinical complications with regard to the pwMRI examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: pwMRI is safe and helpful in the management of patients with VSP after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of pwMRI is higher than that of transcranial Doppler sonography in the detection of decreased perfusion as a result of VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>pwMRI can detect tissue at risk before definitive infarction occurs and therefore may lead to a change of therapy in those patients </plain></SENT>
