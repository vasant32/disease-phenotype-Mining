<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the possible involvement of MAPK in hemolysate-induced signal transduction and contraction in rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isometric tension was used to record the contractile response of rabbit basilar artery to hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blots using antibodies for MAPK were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1) Hemolysate produced a concentration-dependent contraction of rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-incubation of arteries with MAPK kinase inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 markedly reduced the contraction induced by hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 also relaxed, in a concentration-dependent fashion, the sustained contraction induced by hemolysate (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2) Hemolysate produced a time-dependent elevation of MAPK immunoreactivity in Western blot in rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAPK was enhanced 3 min after hemolysate exposure and the effect reached maximum at 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity of MAPK decayed slowly with time, but the level of MAPK was still higher than the basal level even at two hours after exposure to hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3) Pre-incubation of arteries with MAPK kinase inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 abolished the effect of hemolysate on MAPK immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemolysate produced contraction of rabbit basilar artery possibly by activation of MAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MAPK inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
