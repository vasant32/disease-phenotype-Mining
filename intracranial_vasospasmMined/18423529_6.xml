<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest a positive impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy on the incidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess whether a history of prior use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy was associated with a lower risk of vasospasm in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a comprehensive retrospective review of patients with aneurysmal SAH between 1997 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical demographics and imaging data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were reviewed, and a logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, defined as a combination of clinical signs with radiographic confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred eight patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was higher in the group receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (64 +/- 12 vs 54 +/- 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hunt and Hess scores and treatment modality were not significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was observed in 31% of patients not taking a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> (n = 282) vs 23% taking a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> (n = 26), without achieving statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> did not affect risk of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> prior to an aneurysmal SAH trended to reduce the incidence of subsequent vasospasm, without achieving statistical significance </plain></SENT>
