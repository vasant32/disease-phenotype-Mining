<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Citrated plasma and streptokinase were incubated at 37 degrees C to produce a preparation of fibrinogen degradation products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aliquots of the incubate were obtained at 90 minutes, 48 hours, and 1 and 2 weeks after preparation, and were separated into fractions of different molecular weight (MWt), using an ultrafiltration technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each fraction was tested at each of the above times for contractile activity and possible interaction with a threshold concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) on the human basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contractile activity was initially confined to the 90-minute aliquot fraction MWt greater than 100,000, but as the incubation proceeded, such activity was also seen in the lower MWt fraction less than 100,000 greater than 10,000 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This activity was never seen in the fraction MWt less than 10,000 at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> response was initially confined to the higher molecular weight fractions, but after 48-hour incubation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fractions showed this activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that products of fibrin-fibrinogen degradation may be involved directly or indirectly in influencing the pathophysiological mechanism(s) responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
