<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> is a potential contributor to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> accrues in subarachnoid clot, whether its vasoconstrictive effect could involve a direct action on arterial smooth muscle cells, and, if so, whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> affects their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subarachnoid clots were analyzed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The length and 45Ca2+ uptake of vascular smooth muscle cells enzymatically dissociated from canine carotid arteries were measured before and after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments were conducted on cultured smooth muscle cells from canine basilar artery and on ATP-depleted cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean +/- SE <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration in experimental clot was 263 +/- 35.7 mumol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> showed progressive shortening (P &lt; .01) and an increased uptake of 45Ca2+ (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contraction was prevented by Ca(2+)-free media but not by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experiments with heart myocytes showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> caused an increased uptake of 45Ca2+ but not of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> accrues in subarachnoid clot, that it exerts a direct constrictive effect on arterial smooth muscle cells, and that this effect is associated with an increased uptake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Studies on heart myocytes suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> uptake induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> could be due to a selective increase in membrane permeability to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
