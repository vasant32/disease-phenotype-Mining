<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goals of the study were to determine the incidence and time course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> in patients with penetrating craniocerebral gunshot wounds, to study the relationship between vasospasm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in these patients, and to evaluate the effects of vasospasm on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with craniocerebral gunshot wounds underwent computed tomography at admission and then underwent transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Velocities in the middle cerebral artery and the extracranial internal carotid artery were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was defined as a middle cerebral artery velocity greater than 120 cm per second and a hemispheric index (ratio of middle cerebral artery to internal carotid artery velocity) greater than 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies were performed for 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCD was initiated, on average, 1.1 days after injury; 205 studies (mean, 6.3 studies/patient) were performed 0 to 33 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCD showed vasospasm in 14 patients (42.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 studies performed within 24 hours of TCD measurements indicating spasm demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or low CBF in three of five patients with spasm, ruling out hyperemia as the cause of elevated flow velocities in these three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had unilateral vasospasm, and seven had bilateral spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was most prominent from Days 5 through 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was distributed across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of injury severity, as defined by the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Initial computed tomographic scans demonstrated SAH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients with vasospasm but in only 9 of 19 without spasm (100 versus 47%, P &lt; 0.0001, binomial distribution probability test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Outcomes for patients with vasospasm were slightly worse than for those without spasm (35.7 versus 47.4% good outcomes, respectively); however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> is a frequent complication in patients with craniocerebral gunshot wounds and is strongly associated with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The frequency, time course, and severity of spasm are comparable with those observed with aneurysmal SAH and traumatic SAH caused by closed head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study offers new insights into the hemodynamic pathophysiology after gunshot wounds to the brain and suggests that increased vigilance for vasospasm may be of benefit </plain></SENT>
