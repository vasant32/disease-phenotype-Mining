<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen thousand of these patients will either die or become severely debilitated, a mortality morbidity of 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one patient out of five may return to the premorbid state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>International cooperative studies report that the highest rate of rebleeding occurs during the first 24 hours post S.A.H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is no rebound phenomenon during the 7th-8th day post S.A.H </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antifibrinolytics like AMICAR (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">aminocaproic acid</z:chebi>) do not reduce significantly the rebleeding rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In most of the cases the therapeutic level of these drugs is reached only on the third or fourth day of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence antifibrinolytics are inactive during the first crucial seventy two hours </plain></SENT>
