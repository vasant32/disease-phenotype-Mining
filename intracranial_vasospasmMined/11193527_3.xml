<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rod shaped implants (1 mm diameter, 10 mm length, and approximately 10% of nicardipine) was prepared by a heat compression method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten dogs were assigned to two groups: double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group and double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group treated with implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vertebral angiography and arterial blood injection into the cisterna magna were performed, followed by midline suboccipital craniectomy and laminectomy of the atlas and placement of nicardipine implants in the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 2, arterial blood injection into the cisterna magna was repeated (double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 7, vertebral angiography was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were then sacrificed and the brain and blood clot were taken out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the animals involved in both groups had been clinically well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though 5 animals of the control group showed severe vasospasm, no vasospasm was observed in 3 animals and only very mild vasospasm in 2 of the nicardipine-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in diameter between the two groups (0.5 mm vs 1.1 mm, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histological examination showed no specific changes related to implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, left frontotemporal craniotomy and placement of nicardipine implants in the carotid-optico cistern were preformed in 3 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither clinical symptoms related to implants nor specific histological changes were observed (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that nicardipine-prolonged release preparation is safe as well as effective for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
