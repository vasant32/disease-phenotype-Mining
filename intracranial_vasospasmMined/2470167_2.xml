<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We exposed helical strips of dog middle cerebral arteries to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> for 5 hours, rinsed them with bathing medium, and stored them overnight; we compared the responses of strips thus treated with the responses of strips without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relaxation induced by <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> was abolished by hexamethonium and was markedly inhibited after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A low concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (5 mM) elicited relaxation that was abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> and significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent relaxation caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 was attenuated, and that caused by substance P was reversed to contraction after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contraction elicited by substance P also depended on endothelium and was abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relaxation induced by TRK-100, a stable analogue of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">prostaglandin I2</z:chebi>, was moderately attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, concentration-dependent relaxation induced by papaverine and contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha were not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that vasodilations mediated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> nerves, the electrogenic <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> pump, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">prostaglandin I2</z:chebi> were impaired in dog cerebral arteries exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, vascular endothelium appears to participate in cerebroarterial contraction via a release of vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> may be involved in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
