<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 has been shown to be involved in the damaging inflammatory processes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and others in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, the role of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in the cerebral artery after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in rats has been largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in SAH model and to clarify the potential role of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 80 rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group; day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals in day 3, day 5 and day 7 groups were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 and were killed on days 3, 5, and 7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured and the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 expression was assessed by real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of basilar artery was found to be 85,373+/-8794 mum(2) in control group, 59,210+/-7281 mum(2) in day 3, 50,536+/-6519 mum(2) in day 5, and 66,360+/-7452 mum(2) in day 7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries exhibited vasospasm after SAH and became more severe on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The elevated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 were detected after SAH and peaked on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rat experimental model of SAH and these findings might have important implications during the administration of specific <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 antagonists in order to prevent or reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
