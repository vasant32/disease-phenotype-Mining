<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examines the relaxant effect of calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP), a 37-amino acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with a potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> action, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spasm was induced by injecting autologous arterial blood percutaneously into the cisterna magna in adult mongrel dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The single-injection model of SAH was produced by injection of 1.0 ml/kg body weight of blood (on Day 0), and the double-injection model involved two successive injections of 0.5 ml/kg body weight of blood made 48 hours apart (on Day 0 and Day 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On vertebral angiograms, arterial narrowing of the major cerebral arteries was most prominent on Day 3 after SAH in the single-injection model and on Day 7 in the double-injection model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When 10(-10) mol/kg of CGRP was administered intracisternally in the single-injection model on Day 3, the diameter of the spastic cerebral arteries, as determined by angiography, recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After intracisternal administration of 10(-11) to 2 X 10(-10) mol/kg of CGRP on Day 7 in double-injection models, spastic cerebral arteries dilated in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dilatory effect of CGRP continued for a few hours after administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that CGRP injected intracisternally may reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
