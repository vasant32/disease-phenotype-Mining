<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of intra-arterially infused papaverine solutions of various concentrations on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 90 vascular territories in 46 patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> were treated with intra-arterial infusions of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, papaverine was infused at the top of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 90 vascular territories, 30 vascular territories in 14 patients were treated with an infusion of 0.1-0.2% (weight/volume) papaverine (Group 1), 30 vascular territories in 16 patients were treated with a 0.4% (w/v) papaverine infusion (Group 2), and 30 vascular territories in 16 patients were treated with an infusion of 0.8-2.0% (w/v) papaverine (Group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the three groups, we compared the vasodilatory effects of papaverine by assessing the angiographical and clinical improvements following the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When 0.4% (w/v) papaverine was infused, 24 vascular territories (80%) were successfully dilated and 7 patients (44%) showed a marked reversal of neurological deficits due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 80 mg/20 ml (0.4% (w/v)) papaverine infused over a 10-minute period proved to be a beneficial concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient focal neurological deficits due to the infusion of papaverine occurred in 1 Group 1 patient (7%), 1 Group 2 patient (6%), and 7 Group 3 patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Highly concentrated papaverine had a higher risk of temporary deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the papaverine concentration of 0.4% (w/v) infused at the top of the ICA was a safe and adequate concentration for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
