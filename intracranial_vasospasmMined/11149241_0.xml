<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentration of TF in CSF after SAH was measured, and the effects of TF on cultured smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were evaluated in order to understand the relationship between TF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cisternal CSF samples were collected from 12 patients (seven men and 13 women) with SAH due to the rupture of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>, and eight control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups: (1) those presenting no clinical and radiological evidence of vasospasm (the non-vasospasm group; three men and 10 women, mean age 54.7 years), and (2) those presenting evidence of vasospasm (the vasospasm group; four men and three women, mean age 58.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration of TF in CSF was measured using Speriol micro-transferrin measure assay method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi> accumulation in the culture media of SMCs incubated with TF was determined by diazotization method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS) in SMC incubated with TF were measured by the reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of TF were markedly different in the SAH and the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects had no detectable quantity of TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after SAH had quantifiable TF in their CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a significant difference between the vasospasm group and the non-vasospasm group in TF levels (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the vasospasm group, the average value was 10.43 +/- 2.8 mg dl-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the non-vasospasm group, the average was 3.69 +/- 0.31 mg dl-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> content in the culture medium incubated with TF was three times the content of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TF also induced iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in SMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that an elevation of TF concentration in CSF after SAH was detected and iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in SMCs was also induced by TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This may be involved in some roles of the development of the pathological series of events after SAH, including vasospasm </plain></SENT>
