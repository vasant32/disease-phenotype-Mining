<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increases in PKCm of similarly small magnitude were found in vitro when control artery segments were exposed to hemolysate, but only if the arterial smooth-muscle cells were first slightly depolarized by increased extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> to values of membrane potential similar to those observed in canine cerebral arteries during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These increases in PKCm (6-8% of total PKC content) coincided with a greatly augmented contractile response to hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results show that the previous observation of only a small increase in PKCm (approximately 7% of total PKC content) after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the canine model does not preclude a potentially important role for PKC-mediated contraction in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
