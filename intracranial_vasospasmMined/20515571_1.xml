<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six animals were divided between four groups: control (sham-operated), SAH (model alone), SAH + DP (the SAH model in which DP dissolved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulphoxide</z:chebi> [DMSO] was injected once daily for 5 days into the cisterna magna), and SAH + DMSO (the SAH model in which DMSO [vehicle] was injected daily for 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area, wall thickness, neurological deficit score and vasospasm index between the SAH + DP and SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between arterial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area and arterial wall thickness, and also between the neurological deficit score and vasospasm index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells that were positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick end-labelling (TUNEL) and p53 expression were significantly increased in the SAH + DMSO and SAH groups, but not in the SAH + DP group, versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, DP may attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH by suppressing p53-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
