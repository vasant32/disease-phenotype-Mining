<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vast majority are due to explosive blast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although explosive blast TBI (bTBI) shares many clinical features with closed head TBI (cTBI) and penetrating TBI (pTBI), it has unique features, such as early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evolving work suggests that diffuse axonal injury (DAI) seen following explosive blast exposure is different than DAI from focal impact injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These unique features support the notion that bTBI is a separate and distinct form of TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the current state of knowledge pertaining to bTBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Areas of discussion are: the physics of explosive blast generation, blast wave interaction with the bony calvarium and brain tissue, gross tissue pathophysiology, regional brain injury, and cellular and molecular mechanisms of explosive blast neurotrauma </plain></SENT>
