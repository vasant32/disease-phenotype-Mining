<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Over the past decade, low-pressure, flow-directed balloons have been replaced by over-the-wire balloons in the treatment of vasospasm induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors assess the procedural safety and technical efficacy of these newer devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-five patients who underwent 85 balloon angioplasty procedures for the treatment of SAH-induced vasospasm were identified from a prospective quality-assurance database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records and angiographic reports were reviewed for evidence of procedural complications and technical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No vessel rupture or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred, but thromboembolic complications were noted in four (4.7%) of the 85 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Balloon angioplasty was frequently attempted and successfully accomplished in the distal internal carotid (100%), proximal middle cerebral (94%), vertebral (73%), and basilar (88%) arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe narrowing was present in 89 proximal anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was attempted in 41 of these vessels and was successful in only 14 (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 19 of the 27 unsuccessful attempts, the balloon could not be advanced over the wire due to severe vasospasm or unfavorable vessel angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography in a subset of patients demonstrated that severe recurrent vasospasm occurred in 15 (13%) of 116 vessels studied after angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over-the-wire balloons involve a low risk for vessel rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The anterior cerebral artery remains difficult to access and successfully treat with current devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further improvements in balloon design, such as smaller inflated diameters and better tracking, are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, thromboembolic complications remain an important concern, and severe vasospasm may recur after balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
