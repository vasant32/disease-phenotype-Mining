<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate autoregulatory mechanisms in different vascular territories within the first week after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) by perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PW-MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, regional cerebral blood flow and volume (rCVF and rCBV) were measured in relation to different degrees of angiographically visible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 51 SAH patients, PW-MRI and digital subtraction angiography were performed about 5 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF and rCBV were analysed in the territories of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and the basal ganglia of each hemisphere in relationship to the degree of CVS in the particular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations between rCBF, rCBV and CVS were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CVS was found in 22 out of 51 patients in at least one territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> territories, rCBV decreased with increasing degree of CVS, correlated with a decrease of rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ACA territories, SAH patients with severe CVS had significantly lower rCBF compared to healthy subjects and to SAH patients without CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the basal ganglia, rCBF and rCBV of the control group were significantly higher compared to the patients without and with moderate vasospasms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PW-MRI showed simultaneous decrease of rCBF and rCBV in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The fact that rCBV did not increase in territories with CVS to maintain rCBF reveals dysfunctional vascular autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vasospasms in the microvasculature are most evident in the basal ganglia, showing decreased rCBV and rCBF even in SAH patients without CVS </plain></SENT>
