<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (DCI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CV) are common complications after aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, aSAH patients have a high risk of poor long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, or its two types of receptors, ET receptor A (ET(A) ) and ET receptor B (ET(B)), may play a role in the pathogenesis of DCI and CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic variations within the ET-1,ET(A), or ET(B) genes may also account for variance observed in the outcomes of aSAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe the distribution of the Lys198Asn polymorphism, a known functional SNP in the ET-1 gene, and tagging SNPs of the ET-1, ET(A), and ET(B) genes in individuals recovering from aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study also investigated the relationships among the ET polymorphisms, DCI, and global functional outcomes measured at 3 and 6 months after aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants included individuals aged 18-75 years with a diagnosis of aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend found between the variant allele of an ET-1 SNP (rs6912834) and angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were also associations found between two ET(B) SNPs (rs9574124 and rs3027111) and poor outcomes as measured by the Glasgow Outcome scale at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the role of ET-1 and ET(B) in recovery following aSAH </plain></SENT>
