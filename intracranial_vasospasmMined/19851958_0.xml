<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the efficacy of GYKI 52466, a 2,3-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> that is a selective and potent alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, in a rat femoral artery vasospasm model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into 3 groups of 9 animals each: sham-operated control (group 1), vasospasm group (group 2), and vasospasm-plus-treatment group (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In groups 2 and 3, autologous blood (0.1 mL) was applied to a 1-cm segment of the femoral artery, which was then wrapped with a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> cuff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One minute after blood application, the rats in group 3 received an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg GYKI 52466 every 12 h for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses to blood application and treatment were evaluated with light and electron microscopy examinations of femoral artery specimens at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On light microscope examination, the mean diameters of the arterial lumens in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 514.47+/-15.3, 317.63+/-12.1, and 503.91+/-9.6 microm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, the mean arterial wall thickness in group 1 was 77.69+/-4.2 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mean thickness in group 2 increased to 164.82+/-9.1 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After GYKI treatment in group 3, the mean arterial wall thickness measured 95.37+/-5.3 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group 2 rats, electron microscopy demonstrated various changes including marked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing and increased wall thickness in the femoral arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding were the degenerative changes in the endothelium, which presented as a corrugated appearance of the internal elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rats in group 3 had endothelia that were slightly constricted and smooth muscle cells that were relaxed; changes in the vessel wall and internal elastic lamina were less prominent in these rats than in the rats of group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that GYKI 52466 inhibited AMPA receptors and induced relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the wall of the femoral artery in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This substance may be a protective and therapeutic agent in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
