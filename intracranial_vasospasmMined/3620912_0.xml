<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have considered the action of potential spasmogens on intraparenchymal resistance vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a common preparation for neurophysiology, the rat hippocampal slice, to study penetrating arterioles and their response to a variety of potential vasoconstrictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dilute serum from clotted rat blood evoked profound microvascular constriction when applied to the slice, but plasma incubated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to prevent coagulation was unable to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A variety of potential vasoconstrictor substances were tested to see if they could duplicate the effects of serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> (10 microM), <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (one microM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (one nM) were ineffective in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when a stable eicosanoid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi>, was applied at a concentration achieved in the cerebrospinal fluid of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients, it duplicated a portion of the vasoconstriction produced by serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> may account for part of the spasmogenic property of serum and that unidentified molecules in the coagulation pathway may also play a role </plain></SENT>
