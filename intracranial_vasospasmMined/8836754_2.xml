<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the most efficacious timing of mechanical clot removal on pharmacological responses in a monkey SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were randomized into five groups: sham-operated, clot removal in which the clot was removed 48, 72, or 96 h after SAH, and clot groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An autologous blood clot was placed around the bilateral major cerebral arteries after craniectomy to mimic the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the SAH, proximal and successively distal parts of the middle cerebral arteries were cut into rings for isometric tension measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxytryptamine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F20, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> were greater in the proximal parts than in the distal parts in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the sham-operated group, the responses of the clot-removal and clot groups to the drugs were progressively attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine in the proximal parts and to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> in the distal parts started to decrease, significantly, in the clot-removal group 48 h after SAH, while most of the responses to the other <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> began to decrease in the clot-removal groups later than 72 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the attenuation of cerebrovascular contractile responses 7 days after SAH is pharmacologically inevitable, even if the clot is removed as early as 48 h after the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clot removal may thus be recommended within 48h after SAH to ameliorate the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
