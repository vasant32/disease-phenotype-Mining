<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A primate model was used to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (OxyHb), methemoglobin (MetHb), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> is likely to be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty cynomolgus monkeys were randomly assigned to one of five groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On Day 0, each animal underwent angiography followed by right craniectomy and placement of an Ommaya reservoir with its catheter adjacent to the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals received intrathecal injections twice a day for 6 days of one of the following solutions: mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); OxyHb; MetHb; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>; or supernatant fluid from an incubated mixture of autologous blood and mock CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, angiography was repeated and the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of angiograms obtained on Day 0 and Day 7 of the experiment showed significant vasospasm of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the right anterior cerebral and internal carotid arteries in the animal groups that had received OxyHb or supernatant fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a smaller reduction in diameter of the same vessels in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> group (not statistically significant), while no effects were observed in the groups receiving MetHb or mock CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>'s gave results consistent with the angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One monkey in the OxyHb group developed a delayed-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that OxyHb is the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
