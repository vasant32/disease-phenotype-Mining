<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the value of transcranial magnetically evoked motor potential changes during the vasospasm period in a rabbit experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also recorded motor evoked potential changes after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> treatment during vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal a significant increase in latency periods of evoked potentials during the angiographically proven vasospasm period (34.5%) over those in sham-operated rabbits (9.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> treatment, only a minor increase in latency periods (4.5%) was detected after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the potential value of evoked motor potential recording as a diagnostic tool in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
