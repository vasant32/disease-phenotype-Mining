<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the microsurgery for early-stage (3 days) of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 127 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> after the rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> were diagnosed by MRI and CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent early microsurgical clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> followed by antivasospasm agents treatment were retrospectively analyzed for their clinical manifestation, characteristics of imaging presentation, the curative effects and experiences of different operative approaches, surgical methods and techniques, pharmaceutical treatment and other integrated management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 127 cases, organized blood clot accompanied with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> surrounding the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found in the course of surgical probing, among which 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> ruptured during the operation; according to the GOS, 109 cases were cured or free of symptom, 23 cases got a transient hemiparalysis or aggravation of hemiparalysis, among which 18 cases were free of symptom, 9 were slight disability, 6 were severe disability, 3 cases die when discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early operation could prevent second-time rupture effectively, lower the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate, and at the same time lower the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the succeeding damage caused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is still the serious complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and inappropriate management would cause critical consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antivasospasm agents used postoperative could help preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and maintaining function </plain></SENT>
