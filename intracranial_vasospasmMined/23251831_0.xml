<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animal models, in response to subarachnoid blood, a dynamic transition of ion channel expression and function is initiated, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term effects differing from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial hypoperfusion after exposure of cerebral vessels to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> correlates with a suppression of voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel activity, whereas delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> involves changes in other <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel and voltage-gated calcium channels expression and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression patterns and function of ion channels appear to differ between main and small peripheral vessels, which may be key in understanding mechanisms behind <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, changes in calcium and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel expression and function in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> are systematically reviewed and their clinical significance discussed </plain></SENT>
