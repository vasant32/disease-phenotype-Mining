<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although there are still some unresolved aspects, current research has revealed that vascular cell proliferation probably plays an important part in the pathological formation process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a "two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>" model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), this study investigated the function of ERK1/2 and vascular wall cell proliferation in pathological development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty rabbits were randomly divided into five groups: (1) SAH day 1, (2) SAH day 3, (3) SAH day 7, (4) SAH + DMSO (dimethyl sufoxide) solution, (5) SAH + PD98059 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>) dissolved in DMSO solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the SAH + PD98059/DMSO group and SAH + DMSO control group, PD98059 in DMSO (2 mmol/l) or an equal quantity of DMSO, respectively, was injected into the cisterna magna, once a day from SAH day 1 to day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western protein blotting was used to detect the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in each group's basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy and electron microscopy were used for dynamic histological detection at each observation point of the SAH vascular wall under the effects of SAH and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another 18 rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: SAH, SAH + DMSO and SAH + PD98059/DMSO; cerebral angiograpathy was conducted on SAH days 1 and 7, and the progression of angiographic vasospasm evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the extent of vasospasm after SAH increased with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PD98059 significantly reduced angiographic and morphological vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the expression of T-ERK1/2 showed no significant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, expression of p-ERK1/2 and PCNA began to increase significantly on day 3, and achieved a peak on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PD98059 significantly inhibited the expression of p-ERK1/2 and PCNA (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cell proliferation on the vascular wall plays an important part in the pathological formation process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as an important signaling pathway, taking part in the process of vascular-wall pathological proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
