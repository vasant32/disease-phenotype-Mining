<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is an established therapy to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) to prevent delayed ischemic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is minimal evidence available assessing the risk of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the presence of unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on the rupturing of unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in treating CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis between 1999 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were identified and stratified as having (1) additional unruptured unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or (2) ruptured unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic parameters were analyzed and any <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those, 41 had 71 additional unruptured unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and four patients had four ruptured unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean size of unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was: 4.0 ± 1.9 mm (additional unruptured) and 5.3 ± 2.2 mm (ruptured), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ruptured during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combining our data with previously published studies, there appears to be no increase of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture by induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> when compared to the natural history (0.5% for group 1, 2.9% for group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data corroborate that induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be a safe treatment option to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in CVS, even in the presence of unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> does not increase rupture of unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in severe CVS, we conclude that induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> should not be omitted due to the presence of unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
