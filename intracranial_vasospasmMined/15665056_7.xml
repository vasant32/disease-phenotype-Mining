<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contraction of cerebral arteries to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> is augmented after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that activation of Rho-associated kinase (Rho kinase) contributes to augmented contraction of cerebral arteries to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autologous arterial blood (SAH) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (control) was injected into the cisterna magna of anesthetized rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 2 days after injection, the basilar artery was excised and isometric contraction of arterial rings was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum contraction of the basilar artery to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> was augmented about fourfold in SAH compared with control rabbits (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contraction to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (3 mumol/l), an inhibitor of Rho kinase, markedly attenuated <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-induced contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasudil had little effect on contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase, a major target of Rho kinase in regulation of smooth muscle contraction, in the basilar artery was examined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In basilar arteries of SAH, but not control, rabbits, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> increased phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase about twofold at Thr(853) of the myosin-targeting subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that enhanced activation of Rho kinase contributes to augmented contraction of the basilar artery to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> after SAH </plain></SENT>
