<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 (ET-1) may be involved in the upregulation of cerebroarterial resistance under pathologic conditions, most notably in the development of vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, blocking the contractile action of ET-1 by receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may prove to be a new and worthwhile approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, decreasing synthesis and release of ET-1 by blocking the endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity may also prove worthwhile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we have therefore investigated the effect of several putative ECE inhibitors in isolated rat basilar artery by measuring isometric contraction after application of big ET-1, the precursor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> which is not vasoactive in itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of phosphoramidon (10(-4) M in segments with an intact endothelium or 5 x 10(-4) M in de-endothelialized segments), there was only a small shift to the right of the concentration-effect curve for big ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 10(-3) M thiorphan (a selective inhibitor of the neutral endopeptidase) did not affect big ET-1-induced contraction, both alone and in combination with phosphoramidon (10(-3) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the big ET-1 analogue [22Phe]big ET-1[19-37] was applied, an increase in resting tension occurred irrespective of whether or not the endothelium was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the presence of 10(-5) M [22Phe]big ET-1[19-37], contraction induced by big ET-1 was not affected in de-endothelialized segments but rather was enhanced in endothelium-intact segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the presence of functional ECE activity in the rat basilar artery wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, such activity could not be markedly inhibited with different putative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the chemical nature of the cerebroarterial ECE activity must be further elucidated before rational development of efficient ECE inhibitors for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> becomes possible </plain></SENT>
