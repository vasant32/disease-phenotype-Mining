<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin at 0.25 units/ml produced a contraction of isolated canine basilar arteries that developed slowly and was sustained for at least 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasmin and thrombin (1 unit/ml) acted synergistically to enhance the contractile response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to plasmin, the marked contraction elicited by thrombin ended within 1 hour, and afterward the artery was completely tachyphylactic to thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrin clot, fibrinopeptides, and fibrin degradation products did not prolong significantly the effect of thrombin or prevent the tachyphylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasmin and thrombin may occupy a common membrane receptor because exposing the artery briefly to trypsin (24 micrograms/ml) thereafter abolished the contractile effect of plasmin and thrombin without affecting the action of other <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III (1.0 unit/ml) relaxed basilar arteries that were precontracted with plasmin (0.5 unit/ml), thrombin (1.0 unit/ml), <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (10(-5) M), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (10(-4) M), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (8 X 10(-2) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the vasoconstrictor effect of thrombin might contribute to hemostasis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) but, because of tachyphylaxis, not to delayed vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the constrictor action of plasmin might appear late in the course of SAH in association with clot lysis and tissue repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Last, the level of the vasorelaxant antithrombin III in cerebrospinal fluid could control the appearance and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> in SAH </plain></SENT>
