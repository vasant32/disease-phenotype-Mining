<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our initial experience in setting up a neuroendovascular service in a university-based comprehensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined the rates of referral path, procedural type, and independently adjudicated 1-month outcomes (actual rates) in first 150 procedures (120 patients) and subsequently compared with rates derived from pertinent clinical trials after adjustment for procedural type (predicted rates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were referred from the emergency department (n= 44), transferred from another hospital (n= 13), or admitted for elective procedures from the clinic (n= 63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedures included treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (n= 12); extracranial carotid stent placement (n= 33); extracranial vertebral artery stent placement (n= 13); intracranial angioplasty and/or stent placement (n= 12); embolization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (n= 35), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (n= 5), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (n= 10); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> treatment (n= 26); and others (n= 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 100% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration and extracranial carotid artery stent placement, and 95% for those undergoing intracranial or vertebral artery stent placements; and partial or complete recanalization was achieved in 72% of patients undergoing intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for procedural type, the actual adverse event rate of 3% compared favorably with the predicted rate of 7% based on the results of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We provide estimates of procedure volumes and outcomes observed in the initial phase of setting up a neuroendovascular service with an active training program </plain></SENT>
