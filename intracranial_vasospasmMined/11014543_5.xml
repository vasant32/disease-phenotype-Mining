<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors previously reported that OxyHb produced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cultured vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The change in intracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ homeostasis was expected to be one of the possible mechanisms of the cytotoxic effects of OxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ channel blockers on OxyHb-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cultured bovine coronary artery and brain microvascular endothelial cells (passages 5-9) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cell density study, immunohistochemical staining, and DNA fragmentation analysis were performed to confirm <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various concentrations (1-50 microM) of OxyHb were used for 24- to 72-hour incubations with and without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+-channel blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> produced cytotoxicity leading to cell detachment from the culture dish in time- and concentration-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest dose (50 microM) of OxyHb produced cell detachment after a 24-hour incubation, and the lower doses (1-10 microM) produced cell detachment after 48 to 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurred in cells that were still attached to the side of the culture dish after 48 to 72 hours of OxyHb treatment (5 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The OxyHb (10 microM) produced DNA ladders at 48 to 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+-channel blockers were used to prevent the toxic effect of OxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+-channel blocker nicardipine (1 microM), the voltage-independent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+-channel blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4754">econazole</z:chebi> (10 microM), and the inorganic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+-channel blocker <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33336">lanthanum</z:chebi> (100 microM) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> failed to prevent cell detachment or DNA ladders produced by OxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results were similar in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> produced apoptotic changes in cultured vascular endothelial cells, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+-channel blockers did not prevent OxyHb-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
