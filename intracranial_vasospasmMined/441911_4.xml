<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm tended to occur initially on arteries close to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, later extending to other locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contralateral spasm was more frequent the closer the site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to the mid-sagittal line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spasm observed angiographically varies in relation to the site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>; the site of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the subarachnoid space was supposed to be the cause of such variation </plain></SENT>
