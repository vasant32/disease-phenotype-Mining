<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial infusion of papaverine relieves <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasms</z:e> by inhibiting smooth muscle contractions and it may simultaneously lead to a disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon and the quantification of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first examined the changes in cerebrovascular permeability after an intracarotid infusion of papaverine (0.20%) in rats by an in situ brain perfusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then demonstrated that changes in cerebrovascular permeability depend on the concentration of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first study in which the degree of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption was accurately quantified in terms of [(14)C]<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> and it was demonstrated that papaverine has a prolonged effect on cerebrovascular permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result suggests the importance of in vivo experiments for a precise evaluation of permeability for many other agents, particularly for the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
