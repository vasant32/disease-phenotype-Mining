<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of a highly selective Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, were investigated on spasmogen-induced contractions of canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Typical spasmogenic substances present after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), including <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2a (PGF2a), 12-deoxyphorbol 13-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48944">isobutyrate</z:chebi> (DPB), sphingosylpho-sphorylcholine (SPC) and high K+, were used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isometric tension was recorded in canine basilar artery rings in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracellular calcium concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) and contraction force were measured simultaneously in fura-2-loaded canine basilar artery strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation levels were measured by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Isometric tension recording revealed that the Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, dose-dependently inhibited vasocontraction induced by PGF2a and SPC, but not that induced by DPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous recordings of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and tension revealed that the vasorelaxing effect of Y-27632 was not associated with changes in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, suggesting that Y-27632 may inhibit calcium sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasocontraction induced by DPB was not inhibited by Y-27632, but was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of MLC was increased by PGF2a and SPC, and significantly inhibited by Y-27632, whereas such phosphorylation was increased by DPB, but not significantly inhibited by Y-27632 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Several spasmogenic mediators released after SAH may cause vasospasm through Rho-kinase-mediated increase in calcium sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rho-kinase inhibitors, including Y-27632, may be effective for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
