<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Free oxygen radicals due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> increase in both vasospasm and proliferative vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This experiment was performed to determine whether GSH plays a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> by preventing the harmful effects of free oxygen radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, GSH was administered intraarterially and intracisternally following vasospasm of the canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Less vasospasm was observed in the group treated with GSH intraarterially following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> than in the one treated with GSH intracisternally and in the control group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase in the two groups treated with GSH intraarterially and intracisternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264954" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arterial degeneration</z:e> was more prominent in the group in which GSH was used intracisternally, while the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase levels were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264954" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial degeneration</z:e> was less in the other group in which GSH was used intraarterially, while the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase levels were high </plain></SENT>
