<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work was to investigate the efficacy of a calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) slow-release tablet (CGRP tablet) for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental SAH was produced in 10 cynomolgus monkeys by placing a clot around the internal carotid artery bifurcation (Day 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five animals, CGRP tablets (1200 micrograms of CGRP) were then placed in the cerebrospinal fluid space (CGRP group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two animals, placebo tablets were similarly placed (placebo group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining three animals were treated with no tablets after SAH (SAH group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A series of angiographic analyses were performed, before SAH and on Days 7 and 14, to examine changes in the diameters of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, and anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CGRP concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid taken before each angiogram was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the SAH and placebo groups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> developed on Day 7 (54.8% of the pre-SAH value at the internal carotid artery, 62.3% at the middle cerebral artery, 51.3% at the anterior cerebral artery, and 56.1% as an average of the three arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the CGRP group, vasospasm was significantly ameliorated at the middle cerebral artery, at the anterior cerebral artery, and on average (81.7, 81.1, and 75.7%, P &lt; 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CGRP concentration was positive only on Day 7 for the CGRP group (6.5 nmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CGRP tablet prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH and may have significant potential for the treatment of patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
