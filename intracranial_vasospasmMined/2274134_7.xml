<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A proliferation of myointimal cells, accompanied by increased deposition of collagen, as well as myonecrosis, have been frequently observed several days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies from our laboratory showed that these myointimal cells had characteristics identical to myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we quantitatively and morphologically examined the effect of cerebrospinal fluid on the ability of myofibroblasts to alter collagen matrices using an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myofibroblasts contract the collagen matrix by rearranging or compacting the framework of collagen fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients with recently ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> significantly accelerated lattice contraction, especially when the patient developed symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that myofibroblasts in the spastic artery can produce a contractile force that contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm, tightening the proliferated collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some unknown agent present in bloody cerebrospinal fluid accelerates the rearrangement of the collagen lattice by myofibroblasts, both of which have, until now, been considered non-contractile components </plain></SENT>
