<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To discover their possible roles in the prolonged contraction seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the authors investigated the messenger (m)<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expressions of rho A and rho-associated kinases alpha and beta in the basilar artery (BA) of a rat double cisternal blood-injection model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was achieved in rats by twice injecting autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna of each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for rho A and rho-associated kinases alpha and beta of the rat BA were analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cisternal blood injection induced a marked corrugation of elastic lamina and contraction of smooth-muscle cells observed with the aid of light and transmission electron microscopy in the rat BA on Days 3, 5, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of the RT-PCR revealed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for rho A and rho kinases alpha and beta were expressed in the rat BA and that they were significantly upregulated and reached their peaks on Day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> upregulation of these proteins indicates that activation of rho A/rho kinase-related signal transduction pathways is involved in the development of long-lasting contraction of cerebral arteries after SAH </plain></SENT>
