<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Responses to increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> were investigated in calcium-free depolarizing solution (60 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> in equimolar replacement for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, 50 mmol/L TRIZMA buffer, pH 7.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of those concentrations that reduced the vasoconstrictor response to 1.6 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> by 50% revealed the following order of potencies on both human and canine arteries: PN 200-110 greater than nimodipine greater than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) and blood were investigated in Krebs-Henseleit solution (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32139">NaHCO3</z:chebi> buffer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On canine arteries, PN 200-110 antagonized responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> when used at 10-30 pmol/L; it was approximately 70 times more potent on basilar than on mesenteric arteries, whereas both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> and nimodipine were, respectively, approximately 10 and 6 times more potent on basilar than on mesenteric arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When canine basilar arteries were constricted by the addition of blood to the organ bath, each of the investigated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> derivatives elicited concentration-dependent relaxation, producing the following order of potencies: PN 200-110 greater than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> = nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On human anterior cerebral arteries, the blood-induced contractions were counteracted in the following rank order: PN 200-110 = nimodipine greater than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that due to its potent calcium-blocking activity on cerebral arteries, PN 200-110 might be of value for the prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasms</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
