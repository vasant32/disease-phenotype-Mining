<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the factors of age and sex have not been addressed in most studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we present receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the accuracy of transcranial color Doppler sonography in diagnosing middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery spasm</z:e> on the basis of flow velocities standardized for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 214 consecutive patients (110 male, 104 female; age range, 12-77 years) who were routinely referred for cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery spasm</z:e> was graded as mild (&lt;/= 25% of vessel caliber reduction) and moderate to severe (&gt; 25% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angle-corrected blood velocity measurements were obtained using a 2.5-MHz probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The velocity values were reexpressed as a percentage of the mean of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference values for the relevant age, for subjects younger than 40 years, and for sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of spasm among 335 arteries studied was 8.1% for mild and 12.8% for moderate to severe middle cerebral artery narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For distinguishing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or moderate to severe vasospasm from lesser grades of vasospasm, peak systolic velocity was the best parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Areas under ROC curves for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and moderate to severe middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery spasms</z:e> were 0.83 and 0.92, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After standardization, the ROC areas increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, to 0.86, and only slightly, to 0.93, for moderate to severe spasms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades of middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery spasm</z:e>, the best efficiencies were found at standardized velocity value of 170% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The accuracy of transcranial color Doppler sonography is high in the identification of middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Standardization of velocities with respect to age and sex increases the accuracy of the method in diagnosing mild middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery spasms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
