<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular pressure (IVP) was measured continuously by the method of Lundberg for an average period of 8 days in 52 patients with recent rupture of an intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were graded as follows according to the system of Hunt and Hess: 13 patients were Grades I-II, 19 patients Grades II-III, and 20 patients Grades III-V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> was measured on angiograms taken on admission and approximately 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drainage of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid was performed intermittently when IVP exceeded 25 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed a close correlation between changes in clinical grade and in mean IVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drainage improved the condition in uncomplicated cases, but was less effective or ineffective when severe vasospasm or rebleeding occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lowering the IVP by drainage did not appear to increase the risk of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to patients with no or slight spasm, patients with severe spasm had a permanently elevated IVP, even before spasm was demonstrable angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean IVP exceeding 25 mm Hg for the whole period of monitoring was associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, indications for continuous monitoring of IVP and ventricular drainage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients are suggested </plain></SENT>
