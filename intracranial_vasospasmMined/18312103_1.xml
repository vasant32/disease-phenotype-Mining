<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that gap junctions might play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to investigate the role of gap junctions and to observe the potential therapeutic efficacy of gap junction blockers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For the in vitro investigation, the effect of heptanol on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbO(2))-induced contraction of isolated rabbit basilar arteries (BAs) was observed by using an isometric tension-recording method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the in vivo experiments, the potential therapeutic efficacy of heptanol and carbenoxolone was surveyed after it was given intravenously in the rabbit double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy was performed to assess the morphological changes in the arteries examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the in vitro method, heptanol significantly inhibited the sustained contraction induced both by HbO(2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> in the BA rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the heptanol-induced relaxation was dose dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of heptanol on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-induced vasoconstriction was weaker than that on the HbO(2)-induced constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After arterial rings were pretreated for 10 minutes, heptanol significantly decreased their responses to the HbO(2)-induced contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the in vivo method, heptanol and carbenoxolone significantly decreased the narrowing of BAs when given intravenously in the rabbit double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In both treated groups, the diameters of the arteries had not changed significantly on Day 7 compared with those of the arteries in the SAH + vehicle and the SAH-only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heptanol and carbenoxolone significantly inhibited the experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Blockage of gap junctions is a probable candidate for a new approach in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Gap junctions may play a pathophysiological role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
