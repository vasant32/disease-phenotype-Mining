<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve of them were divided into three groups (four per group) and subjected to a double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> method of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following SAH, groups were sacrificed respectively on days 3, 5, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three dogs served as controls without blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries were studied with the transmission electron microscopy and with angiography </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In morphologic studies, control dogs did not demonstrate apoptotic-like changes in endothelial cells of the basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Beginning with day 3, apoptotic-like changes were noted in endothelial cells and consisted of condensation of peripheral nuclear chromatin, blebbing of the cell membrane, and condensation of the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such changes progressed with time and were maximally developed by day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is the first study that demonstrates the time course of apoptotic-like changes in the endothelial cells in the vasospastic basilar artery </plain></SENT>
