<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The noninvasive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with the use of conventional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is based on a velocity study of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report a prospective comparative study between transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS), conventional transcranial Doppler (TCD), and angiography in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients underwent routine angiography after surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of vasospasm was determined after a prospective calculation of the angiographic diameter of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, internal carotid artery (ICA), and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood flow velocities (systolic and maximum) of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, ICA, and ACA were evaluated by TCCS and TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The correlation between mean maximum velocity and angiographic diameter was significant for the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (r=-0.637, P&lt;0.0001), ICA (r=-0.676, P&lt;0.0001), and ACA (r=-0.425, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCCS sensitivity and specificity were higher than those for TCD for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (100% and 93%, respectively) and ICA (100% and 96.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For ACA, the sensitivity and specificity were 71.4% and 84.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that TCCS is useful for accurate monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the ACA, TCCS monitors the hemodynamic state of the anterior part of the circle of Willis, which could expose the patient to a delayed ischemic deficit </plain></SENT>
