<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The level of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in cerebrospinal fluid is elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the contractile effect of PDGF on the basilar artery was examined in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rabbit double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> SAH model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the medial layers of the control basilar artery, PDGF had no effect on contraction up to 1 nmol/L, whereas 3 nmol/L PDGF induced slight contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SAH, PDGF induced an enhanced contraction with an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) at 1 nmol/L and higher concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of [Ca(2+)](i) and tension induced by 1 nmol/L PDGF in SAH were 17% and 20%, respectively, of those obtained with 118 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PDGF-induced elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) and contraction seen in SAH were abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In alpha-toxin-permeabilized strips of SAH animals, PDGF induced no further development of tension during contraction induced by 300 nmol/L Ca(2+), suggesting no direct effect on myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi> at 10 micromol/L completely inhibited the tension induced by 1 nmol/L PDGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of myosin light-chain phosphorylation was significantly increased by 1 nmol/L PDGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the contractile response to PDGF of the basilar artery was enhanced in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The PDGF-induced contraction depended mostly on tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca(2+)-dependent myosin light-chain phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of the responsiveness to PDGF may therefore contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
