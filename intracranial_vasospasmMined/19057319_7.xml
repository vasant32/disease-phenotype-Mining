<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Nicardipine has been used to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial (IA) infusion of high concentrations of nicardipine decreases procedure time, but it may affect hemodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a quantitative measurement of improvement of vessel diameter on the angiograms has not been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective database analysis of consecutive patients with symptomatic vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> who failed medical management and received IA nicardipine between September 2005 and June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine (1 mg/mL/min) was infused intra-arterially by microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, heart rate, and intracranial pressure were recorded during the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of IA nicardipine on the vessel's diameter was measured on angiography by two blinded investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six treatment sessions were performed in 22 consecutive patients (13 women; age, 56.4 +/-13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients received IA nicardipine alone, and 8 patients had additional angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average nicardipine dose was 12 +/- 10 mg (range, 2-25 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean decrease of systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure was 17.4 +/- 18.3 mm Hg, 7.7 +/- 10.4 mm Hg, and 10.9 +/- 11.6 mm Hg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no change in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Measurement of 49 vessels in the 14 patients treated with nicardipine alone showed a significant increase in arterial diameters (range, 1-74%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the time of discharge, 11 patients (50%) were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High concentrations of IA nicardipine infusion have a reversible effect on blood pressure and heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IA nicardipine results also in a significant improvement in vessel diameter in patients with vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
