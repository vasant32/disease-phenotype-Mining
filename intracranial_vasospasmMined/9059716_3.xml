<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of calponin was determined in canine basilar arteries in a double-haemorrhage model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty dogs were assigned to three groups: day 0 group, control; day 2 group, dogs sacrificed 2 days after cisternal injection of blood; and day 7 group, dogs given double cisternal injections of blood and sacrificed 7 days after the first injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Constriction of the basilar artery was confirmed by arterial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Portions of the affected arteries or the corresponding region in control animals were solubilized for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecylsulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A major band corresponding to calponin was seen at 34 kD in the basilar artery extracts using chicken gizzard polyclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The densitometer values of the band on Coomassie blue-stained gels were expressed as percentages of day 0 control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The signals of day 2 and day 7 samples were 47% +/- 20% and 23% +/- 12%, respectively (mean +/- standard deviation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportions of calponin to actin/tropomyosin in the day 0, day 2, and day 7 groups were 13% +/- 6%, 6% +/- 2%, and 4% +/- 2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduced expression of calponin may be related to sustained contraction during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
