<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To create a simple artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the occurrence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (SCV) after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) based on clinical and radiographic factors and test its predictive ability against existing multiple logistic regression (MLR) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective database of patients admitted to a single academic medical center with confirmed aSAH between January 2002 and January 2007 (91 patients) was input to a back-propagation ANN program freely available to academicians on the Internet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resulting ANN was prospectively tested against two previously published MLR prediction models for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted the following year (22 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The models were compared for their predictive accuracy with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> models were accurate with their prediction of patients with SCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ANN had superior predictive value compared with the MLR models, with a significantly improved area under ROC curve (0.960 ± 0.044 vs 0.933 ± 0.54 and 0.897 ± 0.069 for MLR models) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple ANN model was more sensitive and specific than MLR models in prediction of SCV in patients with aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conception of ANN modeling for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is introduced for a neurosurgical audience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With advanced ANN modeling, the clinician may expect to build improved models with more powerful prediction capabilities </plain></SENT>
