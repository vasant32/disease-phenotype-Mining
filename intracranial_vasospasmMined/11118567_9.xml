<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Morphological presentations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> and desquamation of endothelial cells, corrugation of the internal elastic layer, and necrotic changes in smooth muscle cells, are well defined in large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to examine pathological changes in cerebral penetrating arteries in a canine double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen mongrel dogs were subjected to an autologous arterial blood (0.4 mL/kg) injection into the cisterna magna on day 0 and day 2 after withdrawal of an equivalent amount of cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiogram was performed on day 0 before the blood injection and on the day the dogs were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dogs were divided into four groups: control (day 0) (n = 4), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and sacrificed on day 3 (n = 4), day 5 (n = 5), and day 7 (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The penetrating arteries were removed and found to be spastic on days 3, 5, and 7, but not in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> and partial desquamation were recorded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs sacrificed on days 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Condensation of chromatin, blebbing of the membrane, and condensation of cytoplasm were identified in many endothelial cells, features that are consistent with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The morphological changes in the penetrating arteries were more pronounced on days 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vasospasm occurred in cerebral penetrating arteries in a canine double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The morphological change in penetrating arteries, especially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in endothelial cells, is consistent with an early phase of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm in a penetrating artery may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that occurs during vasospasm </plain></SENT>
