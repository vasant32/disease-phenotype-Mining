<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte lysate (hemolysate), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (OxyHb), and bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the causative agents for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the signal transduction pathways for the action of these spasmogens are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the possible effect of these spasmogens on the p21Ras protein, an important factor in the signal cascade, in rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemolysate enhanced p21Ras precipitation over a 7-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial increase of p21Ras precipitation occurred after the tissues were incubated for 2 days with hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The peak effect of hemolysate, which was markedly increased compared with control (P&lt;0.05, ANOVA), was observed on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OxyHb and blood CSF, in contrast, failed to produce consistent or marked changes in p21Ras precipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p21Ras inhibitors FTPase inhibitor 1 and manumycin abolished hemolysate-induced enhancement of p21Ras immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that hemolysate activates p21Ras in the rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
