<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We monitored various hemorheological and hemodynamic parameters to assess the effects of hypervolemic hemodilution therapy in SAH patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-eight patients who underwent early craniotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping surgery after SAH were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients (52.0%) developed symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hematocrit level and red blood cell aggregability were measured daily from day 1 to day 14, whereas the circulating blood volume and cerebral blood flow were measured periodically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were also measured using a Swan-Ganz catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hematocrit level was decreased significantly to 29% to 32% by hypervolemic hemodilution therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Red blood cell aggregability increased until day 6 but was significantly reduced by therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>Hypovolemia</z:hpo> tended to develop after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, patients receiving hypervolemic hemodilution therapy became normovolemic to hypervolemic, with a significant increase of cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasospasm, cerebral</z:e> blood flow was significantly lower on the operated side than on the contralateral side, and it increased on both sides with therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SAH develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo>, hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and increased red blood cell aggregability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hypervolemic hemodilution therapy decreases hematocrit level and red cell aggregability while increasing cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Improvement of hemorheological and hemodynamic parameters by this therapy can reverse neurological deterioration due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
