<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29035">Mn2+</z:chebi> relaxed both kinds of cerebral vessels previously contracted with 10(-5) M NA, 10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and 75 mM K+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ID50 (50% inhibition of maximum contraction) was around 10(-7) M for the organic <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and 10(-3) M for the inorganic one </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of segments with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (10(-6) M) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29035">Mn2+</z:chebi> (2 X 10(-3) or 5 X 10(-3) M) caused inhibition of the contractions evoked by the three agents that was greater in the case of K+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> were reversed by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> to the bath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The removal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> from the extracellular medium reduced the contractions elicited by the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50514">vasoconstrictor agents</z:chebi> in both cerebral blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This reduction was greater for K+ than for the other two </plain></SENT>
