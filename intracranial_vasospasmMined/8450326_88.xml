<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From October, 1987, to September, 1989, 41 North American neurosurgical centers in the Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> Study accrued 906 patients with recent (Days 0 to 7) aneurysmal SAH into a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of high-dose intravenous nicardipine to test whether treatment with this agent improved overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients received 0.15 mg/kg/hr of either nicardipine or placebo by continuous infusion for up to 14 days following <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 449 patients randomly assigned to the nicardipine-treated group and the 457 patients assigned to the placebo-treated group were balanced with regard to prognostic factors for ischemic deficits from vasospasm and for overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other medical and surgical interventions were used with similar frequency in both groups, except that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> were used less frequently in the nicardipine-treated patients (26% of the nicardipine-treated group vs. 43% of the placebo-treated group, p &lt; 0.001), and more patients in the placebo-treated group had intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and/or hemodilution administered therapeutically for symptomatic vasospasm (38% of the placebo-treated group vs. 25% of the nicardipine-treated group, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm during the treatment period was higher in the placebo-treated group (46%) than in the nicardipine-treated group (32%) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the reduction in symptomatic vasospasm in the nicardipine-treated group, overall outcome at 3 months was similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five percent of nicardipine-treated patients were rated as having a good recovery according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at follow-up review and 17% were dead, compared to 56% and 18%, respectively, in the placebo-treated group (not statistically significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that high-dose intravenous nicardipine treatment is associated with a reduced incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in patients with recent aneurysmal SAH, but not with an improvement in overall outcome at 3 months when compared to standard management in North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that, while nicardipine prevents vasospasm, hypertensive/hypervolemic therapy may be effective in reversing ischemic deficits from vasospasm once they occur </plain></SENT>
