<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To clarify the role of vascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), both the activity and/or activation mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase in the cerebral vasculature and the effect of oxidase inhibition on SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The changes in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> perimeter of the middle cerebral artery were measured histologically after SAH was induced according to a 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase activity in the cerebral vasculature was measured with a lucigenin assay at different time intervals from 12 hours to 14 days after injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The membrane translocation of p47phox and the protein expression of membrane subunits (gp91phox and p22phox) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase were analyzed using Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> perimeter of the middle cerebral artery started to decrease on day 1 and peaked on day 5 after a second injection of blood, and these changes were significantly ameliorated by treatment with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after the second injection of blood, both vascular production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase activity were markedly increased with enhanced membrane translocation of p47phox, but by 48 hours the enzyme activity had regained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant changes in the expression of gp91phox and p22phox were observed throughout the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase through enhanced assembly of the oxidase components in the early stages of SAH might contribute to the delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in SAH rats </plain></SENT>
