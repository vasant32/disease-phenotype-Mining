<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased vascular contractility plays a fundamental role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of thrombin and its receptor, proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), and other G protein-coupled receptors in the increased contractility, and examined the preventive effects of the thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, and anti-oxidative agents, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and tempol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A rabbit model of SAH was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contractile responses of the isolated basilar artery and the level of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> of brain tissues were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Contractile responses to thrombin and PAR1-activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (PAR1-AP) were enhanced and prolonged after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thrombin-induced contraction persisted even after terminating thrombin stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When sequentially stimulated with PAR1-AP, the second response was maintained in SAH, while it was substantially attenuated in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only a combination of argatroban with <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> or tempol prevented both the enhancement and prolongation of the contractile response to PAR1-AP and restored the reversibility of the thrombin-induced contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, vasopressin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(2Î±) were enhanced and prolonged after SAH to varying degrees, and responded differently to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response to vasopressin exhibited a similar phenomenon to that seen with PAR1-AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> was increased in SAH, and normalized by the treatment with argatroban, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> or their combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Increased vascular reactivity to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in SAH was attributable to the enhancement and prolongation of the contractile response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A combination of argatroban and anti-oxidative agents was required to prevent both the enhancement and prolongation of the contractile response </plain></SENT>
