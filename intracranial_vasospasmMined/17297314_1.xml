<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1996 and 2004, we prospectively and consecutively performed conventional cerebral angiography for six patients with head injuries who showed persistent intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (over 20 mm Hg for longer than 5 days) despite performing various treatments for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had a minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> at admission, classified as Fisher group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the six patients had angiographically confirmed vasospasm, and one of them later developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the five subjects who exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> had undergone hypothermic therapy to control the intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that persistent intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that is treated by hypothermic therapy may be related to late phase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
