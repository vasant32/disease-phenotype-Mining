<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SAH was induced by intracisternal injection of arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed at specified times: immediately after induction of SAH to seven days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cryostat sections of the basilar artery (BA) were prepared and incubated with anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis of the BA revealed a significant narrowing of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter on Day 2 following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While in the non-treated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, no nor only weak expression of ICAM-1 was observed on the endothelial layer of the BA, there was greater expression of ICAM-1 on the endothelial layer of the BA in SAH rats, and the expression was observed also in the medial layer of the artery from Day 2 to Day 5 following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that SAH really causes responses in the cellular immunity not only in the endothelial layer, but also in the medial layer of the artery as a target of immune damage, which is presumed to be one of the important steps in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
