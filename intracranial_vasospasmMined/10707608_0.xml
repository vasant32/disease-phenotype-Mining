<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Timely recognition, diagnosis and adequate therapy are imperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most important factor that aggravates an already difficult prognosis of those entities is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon the presented facts, the aim of this investigation was to establish the value and role of administration of selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>--nimodipine in patients with SAH and IH compared to the degree of neurological and functional impairment, as well as the recovery of the function of consciousness compared to the patients with those syndromes from an earlier period, who were not treated with this <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52217">medicament</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigation comprised 30 patients who received nimodipine and 20 patients without this agent in therapeutic program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of the investigation confirmed significant difference concerning the neurological recovery, improvement of functional capability and recovery or consciousness disturbances, respectively, in patients who received nimodipine compared to the group without this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that nimodipine as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> with multitopic pharmacological effects on mechanism of SAH or IH development, respectively, as well as on the development of complications of those syndromes, particularly to the development of vasospasm and reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with the improvement of hemorrheologic disorders deserves to be included as the unavoidable segment of therapeutic program of SAH and IH syndrome immediately after clinical phenomenology is revealed </plain></SENT>
