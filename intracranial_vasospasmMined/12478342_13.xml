<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) generated by the autoxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> to methemoglobin may be one of the essential factors in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The direct vasocontractile effects of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-)), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> (*OH) on the canine basilar artery and the inhibitory effects of MCI-186 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one</z:chebi>), a new *OH scavenger, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Isometric tension was recorded in basilar artery rings from dogs in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16164">pyrogallol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) donor), and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (VitC)/Fe(2+) (*OH-generating system) were used to generate the ROSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> (10 micromol/L), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16164">pyrogallol</z:chebi> (10 micromol/L), and VitC/Fe(2+) (100 micromol/L each) induced fast <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and transient, slow <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and transient, and sustained contraction, respectively, in the canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> were almost completely inhibited by pre-incubation with catalase (800 U/mL) and those by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16164">pyrogallol</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (150 U/mL), but neither with MCI-186 (10 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contraction induced by VitC/Fe(2+) was clearly inhibited by pre-incubation with MCI-186, but not with catalase or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: ROSs have direct vasocontractile effects on the canine basilar artery in vitro, but different ROSs have different contractile characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such contractions might be related to the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MCI-186 had a clear and selective inhibitory effect against *OH-induced contraction in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison of different radical scavengers may be important in pharmacological assessment, especially targeted on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
