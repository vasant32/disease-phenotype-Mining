<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autologous blood was injected into the cisterna magna of control rabbits and rabbits that had received bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy 2 days before blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three days after blood injection the concentration of NPY in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 5971 +/- 551 pg/ml while CSF from control animals contained 992 +/- 162 pg/ml of NPY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of porcine NPY on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced contraction of rabbit cerebral arteries were also studied in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NPY (1.2 nM) caused a 3-fold potentiation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced contraction of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF from control rabbits diluted by 50% with Krebs solution had no significant effect on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced contraction of cerebral arteries when compared to responses in Krebs solution only; however, diluted CSF from denervated blood-injected rabbits potentiated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced contraction by 2.6-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiserum containing NPY specific antibodies was used to immunoprecipitate the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> from CSF taken from denervated blood-injected rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSF treated with this antiserum contained less than 40 pg/ml of NPY and had no effect on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced contraction of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show that the concentration of NPY in CSF of rabbits is elevated after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, NPY in CSF can potentiate the vasoconstrictor effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> which may contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
