<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clipping of the right distal internal carotid and proximal middle cerebral arteries in eight dogs reduced regional cortical blood flow (rCoBF) by 49% to 58% without altering cardiac output (CO), and produced about 10% hemispheric infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight dogs underwent similar cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and eight dogs underwent arterial manipulation without clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both latter groups received two autologous whole blood infusions within 2 hours, each equal to 20% of the respective dog's total blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite significant CO elevations after the infusions, rCoBF in the middle cerebral arterial territory did not rise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These whole-blood infusions did not significantly alter mean arterial blood pressure, hematocrit, intracranial pressure, or, in dogs with clipped cerebral arteries, the relative size of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that nondilutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> neither elevates collateral perfusion to ischemic regions of the brain nor reduces infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, elevations in CO do not appear to augment blood flow in either ischemic or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
