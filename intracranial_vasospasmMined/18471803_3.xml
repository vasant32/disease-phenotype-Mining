<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that JAK1 is activated in the basilar artery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), however it has not been investigated whether, and to what degree, JAK2 is induced by SAH and also the role of JAK2 in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1 aimed to investigate the time-course of the JAK2 activation in the basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 2, we chose the maximum time point of JAK2 activation and assessed the effect of AG490 (a specific JAK2 inhibitor) on regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SAH animals were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, the elevated expression of activated JAK2 was detected in the basilar artery after SAH and peaked on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After AG490 intracisternal administration, the vasospasm was markedly aggravated and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index of endothelial cells was also significantly increased in the basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl-2 and bcl-xL were down-regulated after the injections of AG490 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that JAK2 is activated in the arterial wall after SAH, playing a beneficial role to vasospasm development, possibly through protecting endothelial cells and up-regulating anti-apoptotic genes </plain></SENT>
