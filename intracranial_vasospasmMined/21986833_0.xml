<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in order to enhance hemodynamic insufficiency during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS), we performed-in a modification to the standard double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model-an additional unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO), expecting aggravation of brain-tissue damage in areas particularly sensitive to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CVS was induced by injection of 0.25 ml autologous blood twice in the cisterna magna of Sprague-Dawley rats with and without unilateral CCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were examined on days 2, 3, 4 and 5, and compared with the sham-operated control group without SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional deficits were graded between 0 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) at 3 Tesla magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) tomography was performed to assess cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brains were fixed, stained and evaluated for histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On day 5, the neurological state was significantly worse in rats with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative CBF/muscle blood ratio was significantly decreased by SAH and lowest in rats with CCAO and SAH (4.5 ± 1.1 vs 2.7 ± 0.6) compared with sham (7.9 ± 1.5; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery (BA) diameter was 79 ± 5 μm (SAH) vs 147 ± 4 μm (sham, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cell count in the hippocampal areas CA1-CA4 was significantly reduced by SAH on day 5 (p &lt; 0.001) and lowest in rats with SAH and CCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CCAO leads to an aggravation of CVS-related delayed brain tissue damage in the modified rat double-SAH model </plain></SENT>
