<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients were found to have CIC on admission as compared to three of 21 healthy blood donors (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of CIC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients was associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of nine patients who developed angiographic vasospasm had CIC on admission compared with one of four without vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with vasospasm showed a twofold increase in plasma C3d levels at the time when the spasm occurred, whereas no significant changes in the C3d concentration could be demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients without spasm or in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that immunological processes involving complement-activating immune complexes are involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following rupture of saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
