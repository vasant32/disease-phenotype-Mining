<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the roles of P(2) receptor subtypes in vasospasm, we examined the changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of P(2) receptor subtypes in basilar arteries from double cisternal blood injection rat models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred male Sprague-Dawley rats, each weighing 350 to 400 g, were divided into 2 groups of 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first group (n=50), the autologous arterial blood (0.2 to 0.3 mL) was injected into the cisterna magna on days 0 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed on day 3, 5, or 7 (n=10 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the sham group (n=10), the rats were injected with saline (0.3 mL) instead of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten rats were killed without blood or saline injection and served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries from rats in each group were used for reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In another group of 50 rats, the same experiment was conducted, and the basilar arteries were collected for transmission electron microscopic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> groups, transmission electron microscopy showed the reduction in vessel perimeter on days 5 and 7 to be approximately 30% to 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The P(2X1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was significantly decreased on day 3 and recovered on days 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The P(2Y1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was transiently increased on day 5, and the P(2Y2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was elevated from day 5 to day 7 (P:&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The differential expression of the P(2) receptors indicates that P(2X1) subtype might not play an important role in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The upregulation of P(2Y1) and P(2Y2) receptors might enable ATP to produce contraction at low levels of concentration </plain></SENT>
