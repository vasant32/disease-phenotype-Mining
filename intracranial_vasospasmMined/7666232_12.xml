<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite growing clinical use of transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA) to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), the precise mechanism of action of balloon dilation on the cerebral arterial wall is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this experiment the authors examined the pharmacological and morphological changes in 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 12 vasospastic canine basilar arteries following in vitro <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> microballoon TBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the SAH group in which the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model was used, vasospasm was confirmed by angiography and the animals were killed on Day 7 after the first SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro TBA was performed on basilar arteries from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and SAH dogs immediately after sacrifice and removal of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed while the arteries were maintained in oxygenated Krebs buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the pharmacological studies, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> were used as vasoconstrictors, and bradykinin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 were used to produce an endothelium-dependent dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and vasospastic groups, the pharmacological responses of dilated segments of basilar arteries were compared to those of nondilated segments of the same arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vessels from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were examined using scanning electron microscopy (EM) and transmission EM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Scanning EM was used to study the intact vessel wall, the smooth-muscle cell layer obtained after digestion with <z:chebi fb="63" ids="17883">hydrochloric acid</z:chebi>, and the extracellular matrix obtained after digestion with bleach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cross-sections of the vessel wall were examined using transmission EM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding was that immediately after in vitro TBA of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and vasospastic canine basilar arteries, there was a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) of responses to both vasoconstrictors and vasorelaxants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As revealed by scanning EM and transmission EM, both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and vasospastic vessels dilated with TBA showed flattening and patchy denudation of the endothelium, and straightening and occasional rupturing of the internal elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, vasospastic vessels dilated with TBA showed decreased surface rippling and mild stretching and straightening of smooth-muscle cells, and mild thinning of the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no gross vascular disruption or obvious change in the extracellular matrix of the vessel walls of either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or vasospastic arteries after TBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that functional impairment of vasoreactivity in the vessel wall as a result of mechanical stretching of the smooth-muscle layer plays a more important role than structural alteration, at least in the immediate dilation produced in vasospastic arteries by TBA </plain></SENT>
