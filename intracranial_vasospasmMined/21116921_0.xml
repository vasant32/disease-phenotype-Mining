<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NO evokes, because of its free radical properties and affinity to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>, ferrous iron and cysteine, a wide spectrum of physiological and pathophysiological effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For many years, different exogenous NOS inhibitors were used to elucidate the role of NOS and NO in health and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Later, endogenous NOS inhibitors, as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endogenous inhibitors as ADMA are produced by post-translational methylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> which is catalyzed by a family of protein N-methyltransferases (PRMT), using S-adenosylmethionine as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ADMA is eliminated by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAH I or II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ADMA hydrolysis increases NOS activity and NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi>, a by-product of ADMA hydrolysis as well as of NO production by NOS, can in turn inhibit DDAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, endogenous inhibition of NOS can be modified via different ways (1) changing the availability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> and/or of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi>; (2) stimulating or inhibiting DDAH activity; (3) modifying methylation via regulating availability of adenosylmethionine; or (4) modifying PRMT activity </plain></SENT>
