<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT criteria quantifying the extent and location of subarachnoid blood (developed in our previous retrospective study) were used in this prospective series of patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 20 of the 22 patients with severe significant clot or thick layer, severe vasospasm was correctly predicted and localized (2 false positives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients with no blood, or diffuse blood, or blood outside the subarachnoid space, the absence of severe vasospasm was correctly predicted in 14 (5 false negatives) </plain></SENT>
