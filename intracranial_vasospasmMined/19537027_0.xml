<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 123 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> located in lateral fissure area confirmed by pathology, 76 males and 47 females, aged 46.2 (4-75), were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal surgical approach and comprehensive therapeutic strategies were selected according to the imaging features and pathological properties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resections were performed by the pterion approach in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases to remove the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, navigational orientation was used in 17 cases, and supervision by B mode ultrasonography was used in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The branches of middle cerebral artery and fissure vein were protected carefully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> above grade U, confirmed pathologically after resection, underwent chemotherapy ( teniposide + semustine or temozolomide) and radiotherapy that was designated individually according to the pathological grade and distribution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was conducted by telephone, mail or outpatient department visit on 102 of the 133 patients (82.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 82 patients (66.7%) underwent total resection, 18 (14.6%) underwent subtotal resection, 16 (13.0%) underwent major resection, and 7 (5.7%) underwent partial resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in 8 cases, brief <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and reaction clumsily in 4 cases, muscle strength decline in 3 cases, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in 1 case, these patients were submitted to symptomatic treatment with progressive improvement of the above-mentioned signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died of malignant intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The follow-up showed that 97 patients survived over 1 year, the 5-year survival rate was 25.6%, and the average survival time was 21.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lateral fissure area <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> can be treated through proficient microsurgical technique after the anatomic training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is the key in the surgery on the lateral fissure <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> to protect the main branches of middle cerebral artery, trunk of middle cerebral vein, and important brain functional areas </plain></SENT>
