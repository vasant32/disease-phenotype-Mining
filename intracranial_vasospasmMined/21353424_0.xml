<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The paper mainly involved the retrospective approach to risk factors of intraprocedual rerupture (IPR) and illustration of our empirical prevention and management on this event as well as its postembolization outcomes evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endovascular treatment was performed in 1308 patients with 1308 ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, and IPR occurred in 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed their clinical records and images, and analysis risk factors of IPR by using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The morbidity of IPR was 1.38% and mortality was 33.33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients survived from rapid completion of coiling with immediate reversal of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation with protamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>, and 3 from emergent external ventricular drainage (EVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 9 of them presented with different degrees of disability and 3 were fully recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (diameter â‰¤ 3.0mm) (OR 284.212, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>17.368-4650.780, P=0.000), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (OR 7.866, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1.113-55.570, P=0.039), Fisher Grade III (OR 82.099, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1.563-431.696, P=0.029), vasospasm (grade I) (OR 32.269, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2.393-435.132, P=0.009) and vasospasm (grade II) (OR 30.238, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>1.770-516.552, P=0.019) are risk factors of IPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> at proximal part of internal carotid artery (ICA), bifurcation and basilar artery (BA) stem (OR 0.003, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>0.000-0.101, P=0.001) and Hunt and Hess Grade II (OR 0.010, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>0.000-0.346, P=0.011) are identified as protective factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, Fisher Grade of SAH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> are the predictors of IPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> at proximal part of ICA bifurcation and BA stem and Hunt and Hess Grade II are less associated with IPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Rapid completion of coiling combined with immediate reversal of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation is confirmed to be the best strategy in our series </plain></SENT>
