<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early vasospasm (EVSP), defined here as arterial narrowing seen on diagnostic angiography within the first 48 hours of aneurysmal rupture, is a rarely reported and poorly defined phenomenon in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize EVSP in a large database of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the relationship of EVSP to clinical characteristics, in-hospital complications, and outcome at 3 months among 3478 patients entered into 4 prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tirilazad conducted in neurosurgical centers around the world between 1991 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-nine (10%) of 3478 patients had EVSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EVSP was significantly more likely in patients with poor neurological grade on admission, history of SAH, intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, thick SAH on cranial computed tomography, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EVSP was not associated with delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for differences in admission characteristics, EVSP was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (adjusted odds ratios [OR]=1.51; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.94; P=0.001), neurological worsening (OR=1.41; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.81; P=0.007), and unfavorable outcome (OR=1.51; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.00; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a trend for patients with increasingly severe EVSP to have unfavorable outcome (OR=1.84 for mild and OR=2.66 for moderate/severe EVSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EVSP was seen in 10% of SAH patients and was predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and neurological worsening as well as unfavorable outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EVSP was not associated with late vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EVSP may be as important as delayed vasospasm in predicting complications and long-term morbidity in SAH patients </plain></SENT>
