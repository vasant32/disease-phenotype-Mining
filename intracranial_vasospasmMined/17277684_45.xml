<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A consequence of this is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inpatient neurosurgical consults related to battle injury from OIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> admissions from OIF from April 2003 to October 2005 was performed on patients with neurotrauma and a diagnostic cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences between patients with and without vasospasm and predictors of vasospasm were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-seven out of 119 neurosurgical consults were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 47.4% had traumatic vasospasm; 86.7% of patients without vasospasm and 80.8% of patients with vasospasm sustained blast trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average spasm duration was 14.3 days, with a range of up to 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was associated with the presence of pseudoaneurysm (P = 0.05), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (P = 0.03), the number of lobes injured (P = 0.012), and mortality (P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those with vasospasm fared worse than those without (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of lobes injured and the presence of pseudoaneurysm were significant predictors of vasospasm (P = 0.016 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant quadratic trend towards neurological improvement for those receiving aggressive open surgical treatment (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the vasospasm group, angioplasty with microballoon significantly lowered middle cerebral artery and basilar blood-flow velocities(P = 0.046 and 0.026, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Traumatic vasospasm occurred in a substantial number of patients with severe neurotrauma, and clinical outcomes were worse for those with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, aggressive open surgical and endovascular treatment strategies may have improved outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This was the first study to analyze the effects of blast-related injury on the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
