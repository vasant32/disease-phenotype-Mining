<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rCBF of 54 patients was measured by the Xe133 inhalation method under identical conditions before and 60 min after oral administration of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>12 patients with focal cerebral circulation disturbances of arteriosclerotic origin, who had suffered a cerebral accident (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, PRIND, minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) no more than 3 weeks previously, were given a placebo (test-retest controls) and 25 patients of the same diagnosis and age group were given 40-80 mg nimodipine orally </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> received nimodipine in i.v. doses of 0.5-2 mg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow, assessed on the basis of the initial slope index (ISI), before and after the medication, was compared by statistical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>12 patients with head injury were given nimodipine intravenously in a dose of 0.5-2 mg with continuous monitoring of the ICP and the blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pressure values were evaluated continuously by computer, with calculation of the perfusion pressure, and tested for statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral nimodipine therapy resulted in a significant (14%) increased of the CBF (taking account of the arterial pCO2), the improvement of blood flow being even more pronounced in the hypoperfused regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
