<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While the rat has been used extensively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> studies, concerns exist whether this animal represents a usable model because its time course and pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH is not comparable to that observed in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, our knowledge of the rat model is based almost exclusively on studies using a 'single <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>' method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since there is a positive correlation between severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and volume of subarachnoid blood, an obvious question is whether the rat will show modifications in vascular responses when insulted by a second SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, an SAH was produced in rats using a 'double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>' method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following SAH, cerebral arteries showed pathological alterations, significant decreases in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> perimeter, and increases in arterial wall thickness, over a 7-day post-SAH period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The above vascular features are considered to be indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and their presence over a 7-day post-SAH period represents a significant time extension when compared to a single <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These modified vascular responses made the double hemorrhaged rat a much-improved animal model </plain></SENT>
