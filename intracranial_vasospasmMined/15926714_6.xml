<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Increased platelet consumption is expected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, according to data from clinical and experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated sequential changes in platelet counts in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and the difference in platelet consumption between patients with and those without symptomatic vasospasm (SV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variables related to platelet count as well as other clinical and radiological variables were analyzed as independent predictors of SV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients who had undergone surgery within 48 hours after SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were entered in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiological variables and blood cell counts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, after SAH were retrospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty of these variables were entered into univariatete and multivariate analyses to determine predictors for SV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After SAH, the platelet count decreased to a minimum and then increased rapidly to levels greater than those recorded on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This change was specific to SAH, and platelet consumption was more severe in patients with SV than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were three independent predictors of SV: a ratio of the lowest platelet count and the admission count greater than 0.7 (odds ratio [OR] 0.322, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.124-0.834, p = 0.0196) and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 0.338, 95% CI 0.126-0.906, p = 0.0311) were negatively significant (that is, decreases the occurrence of SV), and a Fisher Grade 3 (OR 4.42, 95% CI 1.48-13.2, p = 0.0077) was positively significant (that is, increases the occurrence of SV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between a decrease in platelet count and the occurrence of SV indicates the important role of platelets in the pathophysiology of vasospasm following SAH </plain></SENT>
