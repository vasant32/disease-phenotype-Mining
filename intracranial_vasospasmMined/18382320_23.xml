<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The development of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> reductase inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) may decrease the risk of vasospasm, but additional study is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Beginning in May 2006, our treatment protocol for patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was altered to routinely include the use of 80 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> per day for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before this time, only patients with other indications for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The charts of 203 consecutive patients over a period of 27 months were retrospectively reviewed, and 150 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 71 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with 79 untreated patients to determine whether or not the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> was associated with a reduction in the occurrence of vasospasm, delayed infarction, or poor outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e>, or severe disability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and those who were not had similar baseline characteristics, although more patients in the former group were managed with endovascular coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients developing at least moderate radiographic vasospasm (41% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> versus 42% without, P = 0.91), symptomatic vasospasm (32% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> versus 25% without, P = 0.34), delayed infarction (23% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> versus 28% without, P = 0.46), or poor outcome (39% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> versus 35% without, P = 0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, including the method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were still not significantly protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> to standard care was not associated with any reduction in the development of vasospasm or improvement in outcomes after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If there is a benefit to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use, it may be smaller than suggested by previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, further randomized controlled trials are awaited </plain></SENT>
