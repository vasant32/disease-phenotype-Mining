<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In preparation for performing large-scale clinical trials in humans with aneurysmal SAH, the safety of varying doses of tirilazad was tested in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, sequential dose-escalation study at 12 Canadian neurosurgical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred forty-five patients with an aneurysmal SAH documented by angiography were enrolled in the study sequentially within 72 hours of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were assigned to one of three dosage tiers: receiving 0.6 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, or 6 mg/kg tirilazad or vehicle per day intravenously in divided doses through Day 10 following the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients also received oral nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No serious side effects of tirilazad treatment were identified at any of the three doses, despite close monitoring of hepatic and cardiac toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A trend toward improvement in overall 3-month patient outcome was seen in the 2 mg/kg per day tirilazad-treated group compared to the outcomes in the vehicle-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that tirilazad mesylate is safe in SAH patients at doses up to 6 mg/kg per day for up to 10 days and is a promising drug for the treatment of patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
