<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rat cisterna magna (CM) was cannulated and after 7 days SAH was developed by administration of 100 microliters autologic, non-heparinized blood to the CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sham <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was developed by intracisternal administration of 100 microliters of artificial cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 60 min and after 24 h Phosphoramidon was injected into the CM in a dose of 40 nmol diluted in 50 microliters of cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After perfusion, the brain was removed from the skull and histological preparations of the basilar artery were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The internal diameter and wall thickness of basilar arteries were measured by interactive morphometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most severe vasospasm was found in rats after SAH and the administration of Phosphoramidon in the late phase after SAH caused the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of numerous infiltrations composed of neutrophils and macrophages correlated with advanced vasospasm (index of constriction 5 times lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), suggesting the role of other factors participating in the late phase of vasospasms after SAH </plain></SENT>
