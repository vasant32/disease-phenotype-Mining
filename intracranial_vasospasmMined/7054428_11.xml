<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made during continuous monitoring of the intraventricular pressure (IVP) in the first 12 days after the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 226 samples of CSF were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical condition of the patients was graded according to the Hunt and Hess system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> was measured on angiograms taken on admission and again approximately 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations in hemorrhagic and xanthochromic CSF were significantly higher than in clear CSF, indicating <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production from shed blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, regardless of the degree of blood admixture to CSF, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> increased with deteriorating clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with a moderately increased IVP (20 to 40 mm Hg) had <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels of about 3 mmol/liter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A rising IVP or the development of severe spasm was accompanied by a persistent elevation or an increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that increased CSF concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> reflected an increased production of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> by partially ischemic cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A CSF <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> value above 3.5 mmol/liter was associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
