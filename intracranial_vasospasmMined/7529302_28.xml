<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circumstances nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) released by endothelial cells induces relaxation of smooth muscle by activating the soluble form of guanylate cyclase within muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the levels of both endothelial NO synthase, the enzyme that produces NO, and soluble guanylate cyclase were determined in canine basilar arteries in a double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model using Western blot immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty dogs were assigned to three groups: Group D0, control; Group D2, dogs sacrificed 2 days after cisternal injection of blood; and Group D7, dogs given double cisternal injections of blood and sacrificed 7 days after the first injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Constriction of the basilar artery was confirmed by arterial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Portions of the affected arteries or the corresponding region in control animals were solubilized for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecylsulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A specific monoclonal antibody against endothelial NO synthase was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extract from basilar arteries showed two bands on the blots: 135 kD, characteristic of endothelial NO synthase, and 120 kD, which may be a degradation product of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The densitometer values of the bands were presented as percentages of D0 control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the total signal in the D7 group was less than that of the D0 control group (D2, 97% +/- 22%; D7, 78% +/- 40%), it was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the 135-kD form decreased between Groups D0 and D7, but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A single major band corresponding to the alpha-subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase was seen at 70 kD in the basilar artery extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The signals of D2 and D7 samples were 69% +/- 40% and 25% +/- 18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between D7 and D0 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The reduced expression of soluble guanylate cyclase may be related to the impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
