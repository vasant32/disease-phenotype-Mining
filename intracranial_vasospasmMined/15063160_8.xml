<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed the effects of such phosphodiesterases in guinea pig cerebral arteries with organ bath technique and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Guinea pig and human cerebral arteries were used for phosphodiesterase assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol (6-[4-(1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52552">cyclohexyl</z:chebi>-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone), a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, was compared to conventional phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphodiesterases 3 and 4 were the major contributors to total cAMP hydrolysis in the arteries examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors additionally attenuated cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> (cGMP) hydrolysis, but relaxant responses were not dependent on an intact endothelium or on the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-cGMP pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor used was endothelium-dependent and affected by cGMP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors are still effective under conditions with possible dysfunctional nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-cGMP pathway, such as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
