<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Transluminal angioplasty has become a widely used adjunct therapy to medical management of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite anecdotal reports of universal, angiographically confirmed reversal of vasospasm and high rates of clinical improvement, no rigorous examination of the efficacy of this procedure has been conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors assess the efficacy of the aforementioned procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight patients enrolled as part of the North American trial of tirilazad in aneurysmal SAH underwent transluminal angioplasty for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three percent of these patients showed good recovery or moderate disability based on their 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 38 patients who underwent angioplasty, the severity and type of vasospasm, use of papaverine in addition to balloon angioplasty, timing of treatment, and dose of study drug did not have an effect on the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of their neurological examinations improved in only four of the 38 patients immediately after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A conditional logistic regression analysis was performed in which these patients were compared with individuals matched for age, sex, dose of study drug, admission neurological grade, and modified Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score at the time of angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No effect on favorable outcomes was found for this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transluminal cerebral angioplasty is very effective in reversing angiographically confirmed vasospasm, and anecdotal reports of its clinical utility are numerous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in this report the authors conclude that its superiority to medical management for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is questionable </plain></SENT>
