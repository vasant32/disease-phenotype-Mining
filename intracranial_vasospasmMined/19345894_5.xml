<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be particularly challenging in imaging research at the technology assessment level to incorporate patient-centeredness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A primary issue in this field is designing a reference standard that is applicable to the entire study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This important element is necessary for translation of findings into clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our work, computed tomographic perfusion imaging is being evaluated as a new technology used in aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new reference standard employing a multistage hierarchical design incorporating both clinical and imaging criteria to determine a diagnosis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A flowchart of the reference standard levels is provided for illustration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The limitations and potential biases that may occur using this reference standard are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This reference standard will be applicable to the entire study population, including those with and without symptoms or further imaging with digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
