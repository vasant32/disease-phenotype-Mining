<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of fasudil in the treatment of CVS in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A search was conducted using the full-text database of Chinese scientific journals, the Wanfang Database (January 1999 to November 2010), the Chinese Medical Association Digital Journal Database, PubMed, the Cochrane library, OVID, and EMBase (searching through November 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 8 studies met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates of symptomatic CVS and CVS confirmed by angiography among the patients in the fasudil group were only 48% (odds ratio [OR] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.72, P = 0.0005) and 40% (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.24-0-67, P = 0.0004) respectively of that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> for CVS cases in the fasudil group were only 50% (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34-0.76, P = 0.0009) and 43% (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.26-0.70, P = 0.0008) respectively of that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fasudil greatly reduces the occurrence of CVS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in SAH patients, significantly improves the clinical outcomes of the patients (as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the limited number of trials and samples available for analysis, the conclusions from the present study still need to be validated with results from large randomized, controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
