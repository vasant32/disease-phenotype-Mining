<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To elucidate, in light of reports of complications associated with intraarterial infusion of papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, the known propensity of papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> to form precipitate in combination with other solutions or pharmaceuticals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Initially simulating a situation experienced during an intraarterial papaverine infusion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we mixed various concentrations of papaverine with serum, nonheparinized and heparinized saline, and nonionic contrast material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Papaverine in concentrations of 0.3% (300 mg/100 mL of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline) or greater formed a precipitate when mixed with human serum (blood) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The precipitate crystals were 50 to 100 microns in size and could be returned to solution simply by the addition of more serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Crystal emboli are a possible transient cause of complications experienced during treatment of vasospasm with its attendant altered flow dynamics </plain></SENT>
