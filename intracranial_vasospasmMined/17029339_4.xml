<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: This study was conducted to determine whether there is a change in intracranial arterial diameters after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> infusion for vasospasm and, if it is present, to determine whether the change occurs in proximal, intermediate, or distal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors measured arterial diameters in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> at their institutions between August 2003 and September 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 18 treatments were examined in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made before and after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> infusion in a blinded fashion with the aid of a magnification loupe at nine predetermined arterial sites on each angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline arterial measurements were made on each patient's initial angiogram and on the angiogram demonstrating spasm prior to endovascular therapy as well in 14 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Charts were retrospectively reviewed to determine whether the patients benefited from intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the time of the initial angiogram to the time of vasospasm, there was a 21.6% decrease (p = 0.092) in proximal artery diameter, a 47.1% decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in intermediate artery diameter, and a 12.4% decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in distal artery diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in the diameters of proximal, intermediate, or distal vessels after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> infusion (mean dose 7.4 mg, range 2.5-10 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After infusion of intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, the proximal vessels showed a 1.1% decrease in diameter, the intermediate vessels showed a 9.4% increase, and the distal vessels showed a 3.3% decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> does not cause a significant increase in the diameter of vasospastic vessels at the administered doses </plain></SENT>
