<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the hypotheses that structural stiffening of the arterial wall contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and that alteration in properties of smooth muscle takes place after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm were induced in dogs by two cisternal injections of autologous blood (on Day 0 and Day 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was confirmed by angiography performed on Day 0 and Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals in the control group underwent angiography only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Day 8, the mechanical properties of the basilar arteries were studied in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Passive compliance, measured under total inhibition of spontaneous myogenic tone with diltiazem (10(-4) M) plus papaverine (10(-4) M) was smaller in the SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The length-contraction curve was shifted to the left and the optimum length for maximum contraction (Lmax) was significantly shorter in the spastic blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous myogenic tone was augmented in the SAH group, resulting in an increase in resting tension at each length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the maximum contractions in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> were markedly reduced in the SAH group, without changes in sensitivity to these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These differences in mechanical properties were observed in rings both with and without endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm, stiffening of the noncontractile component of the vasculature takes place as well as alterations in the contractile component, both of which presumably contribute to the shift in resting length-tension relationship and length-contraction relationship of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decreased distensibility, the increase in resting tension, and the shortening of the Lmax <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> favor a smaller diameter of the artery after SAH, possibly contributing to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
