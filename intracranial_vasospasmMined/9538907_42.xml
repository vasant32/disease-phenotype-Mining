<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoregulatory vasodilation can be detected in vivo as an increase in the parenchymal cerebral blood volume (CBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional CBV, CBF, and oxygen extraction fraction in regions with and without angiographic vasospasm obtained from 29 positron emission tomography studies performed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture were compared with data from 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and five patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF was reduced compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in regions from SAH patients with and without vasospasm as well as with ipsilateral carotid occlusion (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional oxygen extraction fraction was higher during vasospasm and distal to carotid occlusion than both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and SAH without vasospasm (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional CBV was reduced compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in regions with and without spasm, whereas it was increased ipsilateral to carotid occlusion (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings of reduced parenchymal CBV during vasospasm under similar conditions of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> that produce increased CBV in patients with carotid occlusion provide evidence that parenchymal vessels distal to arteries with angiographic spasm after SAH do not show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> autoregulatory vasodilation </plain></SENT>
