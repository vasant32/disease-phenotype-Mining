<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has been commonly described following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) though its impact on neurological outcome, especially in head trauma, has not been yet elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to monitor and correlate neurological condition and flow velocities (FVs) in the arteries of the brain after SAH and more particularly to investigate the influence of basilar artery (BA) vasospasm on neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) evaluations were conducted in 116 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH was of traumatic origin (tSAH) in 59 patients and spontaneous (sSAH) in 57 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA was defined by a mean FV exceeding 120 cm/s and three times the mean FV of the ipsilateral ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery (BA) vasospasm was defined as moderate whenever the FV was higher than 60 cm/s and severe above 85 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Sixty-two patients (53.4%) had elevated FVs in the BA, among these 34 (29.3%) had FVs above 85 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basilar vasospasm was significantly more common in tSAH (59.7%) than in sSAH (40.3%, P=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with moderate and severe BA vasospasm, FVs in the BA increased on the third day after admission and remained elevated for a week before returning to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value by the end of the second week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This elevation in BA FVs in patients with BA vasospasm was followed by a significant and progressive worsening in the neurological condition at the end of the first week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Permanent neurological deficit was associated with elevated BA FVs consistent with moderate BA vasospasm whereas patients who remained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e>, had FVs consistent with severe BA vasospasm (P=0.00019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The present results further support that BA vasospasm may act as an independent factor of ischaemic brain damage following SAH, especially in head trauma </plain></SENT>
