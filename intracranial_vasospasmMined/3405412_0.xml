<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three of these animals, assessments were made before and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) induced by injecting autologous arterial blood into the cistern magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that the basilar artery diameter as evaluated by CT was 47% larger than that measured by arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was a very good correlation (n = 63, r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) between the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This paper presents a new model for the measurement of the basilar artery diameter, one which may also provide a safer method for the evaluation of vasospasm in humans </plain></SENT>
