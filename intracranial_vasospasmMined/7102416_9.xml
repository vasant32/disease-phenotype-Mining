<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Substances in combination may also act synergistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the multifactorial causes of vasospasm, the main causative agent may also be different in various subgroups of patients, leading to differential sensitivities to potential treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contraction of vascular smooth muscle is ultimately caused by an increase in the intracellular concentration of free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanical, osmotic, or ischaemic trauma may also result in calcium overloading with development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many "rational" pharmacological approaches to the treatment of vasospasm have been proposed, but clinical experience has so far been disappointing; agents active against only one possible causative factor may possess too specific a mechanism of action to control spasm caused by several agents simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new group of drugs, the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, has selective and potent relaxant actions against the contractions of cerebral vessels produced by a wide range of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They may be of therapeutic use in both the prophylaxis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
