<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracranial vessels were clearly shown by 3D-CTA in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3D-CTA revealed spasm in the vessels of nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Catheter angiography performed in seven of these patients immediately after 3D-CTA confirmed vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A low-attenuation area was seen on CT in the other two patients, representing an ischaemic lesion due to the spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, a second 3D-CTA was performed using the same technique 1 week after the first, showing no vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial 3D-CTA revealed no vasospasm change in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following 3D-CTA, one of these had conventional angiography, which also demonstrated no spasm </plain></SENT>
