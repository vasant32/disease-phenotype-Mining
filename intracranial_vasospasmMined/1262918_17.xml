<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Temperature was found to have a profound effect on the artery's response to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raising the temperature to 40 degrees C (104 degrees F) increased the maximum response by 20% and lowering the temperature by 10 degrees C caused a 40% reduction in the maximum contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative log-dose response curves for analogues of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> demonstrated a high degree of specificity for the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> receptor and large nonphysiological concentrations of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> caused relaxation of the contracted artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracellular calcium was shown to be an absolute requirement for <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-induced contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracellular <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, in contrast, was shown to inhibit <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-induced contractions </plain></SENT>
