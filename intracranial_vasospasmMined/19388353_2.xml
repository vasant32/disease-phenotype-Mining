<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> have been shown to have efficacy in ameliorating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) via upregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 47 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups: sham-operated, SAH treated with vehicle, SAH treated with low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg), high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg), SAH treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> plus the PI3K inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>), and sham-operated plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> was administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes after SAH created by the standard endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological parameters of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA-diameter, perimeter, and wall thickness) and neurological score were assessed at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Mortality was reduced to zero in both the treated groups as compared to 20% in the vehicle-treated and 36% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease in ICA diameter and perimeter observed in vehicle-treated group (203.2 +/- 10.3 microm, 652.7 +/- 29.0 microm) as compared to sham (259.7 +/- 10.6, 865.4 +/- 39.5) were significantly attenuated by high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (267.4 +/- 8.0, 882.4 +/- 30.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase in wall thickness (vehicle 29.50 +/- 2.42 microm v/s sham 9.52 +/- 0.56 microm) was significantly attenuated by both high and low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (11.87 +/- 1.56, 19.75 +/- 1.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> were blocked with the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> (162.7 +/- 20.6, 528.9 +/- 65.9, 29.19 +/- 1.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> improved the neurological deficits after SAH, but this was also blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> in ameliorating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> are likely mediated by upregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
