<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Animals were assigned to one of three groups: control (five dogs), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> alone (four), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (four) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A double SAH model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline basilar artery (BA) angiograms were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were repeated at Days 3, 7, and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the BA diameter was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased BA diameter was seen on Day 3 in the control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A return to baseline diameters was seen by Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase from baseline diameter was seen in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group at Day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> may interfere with the vasodilatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vasodilation greater than baseline is seen at Day 10 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> does not ameliorate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a canine model to a greater extent than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
