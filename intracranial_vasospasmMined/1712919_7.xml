<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> canine model, administration of high-dose MP (10 mg/kg, every 12 hours) reduced angiographic narrowing of the basilar artery and prevented morphological changes in the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> observed from days 4 to 7 in untreated SAH dogs was inhibited by the MP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An in vitro experiment showed that MP inhibited platelet aggregation dose-dependently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-dose MP had a nonspecific vasodilatory effect on the smooth muscle of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another SAH model with dysautoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), intravenous MP administration markedly attenuated the decrease in both blood pressure and CBF caused by exsanguination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that MP has beneficial effects in normalizing CBF dysautoregulation following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-dose MP has several advantages for preventing and improving the multiple pathological status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
