<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first and second cases, predeterioration CBVs were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both of these patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> and a decreased red blood cell volume at the time of neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A predeterioration CBV was not available for the third patient for comparison, but his red cell volume was also markedly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postrecovery CBVs were obtained in the second and third cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggested that a depleted red blood cell volume was more responsible for neurological deterioration than was a lowered plasma volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To prevent the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients, we should monitor CBV not only at the time of neurological deterioration, but also at the time of admission and during the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
