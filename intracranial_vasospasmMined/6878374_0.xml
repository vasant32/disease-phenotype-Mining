<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several problems were encountered during the investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the solution was temporary, that is, within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is considered logical because perfluorochemical particles are eliminated fairly rapidly from the circulating blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successive administrations should be necessary until <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is remitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another problem is that it is not clear whether the doses of the solution given in this study (10 ml/kg/day) are sufficient or not, since the depth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is considered to vary depending on the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It might be necessary to change the volume of the solution given in accordance with the depth of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of each patient </plain></SENT>
