<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral arteries were isolated from dogs sustained experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> (SAH) and the results were compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> canine cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amount of 6-Keto-PG F1 alpha (stable metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> released from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral arteries were 455 +/- 84 (n = 7) and 177 +/- 72 (n = 8) ng/min/g dry weight (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> metabolites, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> (stable metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>), PGF2 alpha, <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> were also measured, but release of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> metabolites were little compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> released from the cerebral arteries subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were 110 +/- 34 (n = 6), 169 +/- 40 (n = 6) ng/min/g dry weight respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SAH group, release of 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> had diminished remarkably, but no remarkable quantitative change were seen among other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> metabolite between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diminution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> release in the cerebral artery subjected to SAH may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The release of PGs from canine pial arteries induced by the exposure of the pial arteries to red blood cell hemolysate was also estimated by RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> tended to increase following to exposure to hemolysate but no other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> was increased </plain></SENT>
