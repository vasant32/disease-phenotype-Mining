<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the efficacy of the orally active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin receptor antagonist</z:chebi> RO 47-0203 for prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, using the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> dog model, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight beagle dogs were used in this laboratory experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen animals each were assigned to the treatment and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group, each dog received two single doses of 30 mg/kg RO 47-0203 orally per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery decreased from 1.36 +/- 0.17 mm on Day 1 to 1.19 +/- 0.23 mm on Day 8 in the treatment group, whereas in the control group, the vessel diameter decreased from 1.48 +/- 0.19 mm on Day 1 to 1.02 +/- 0.22 mm on Day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results corresponded to a decrease of vessel diameter of 13.1% +/- 11.2% in the treatment group and a decrease of vessel diameter of 30.7% +/- 12.4% in the control group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of endothelin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid significantly increased with time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results emphasize the important role of endothelin in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and present first-time evidence that prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can be achieved by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin receptor antagonist</z:chebi> RO 47-0203 </plain></SENT>
