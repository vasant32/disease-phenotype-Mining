<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transgenic C57Bl6 mice with a haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 genotype develop more severe vasospasm than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (Hp 1-1) mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the toxicity of systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> and its effect on basilar artery (BA) vasospasm, neurobehavioral scores, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS)/endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression after SAH in Hp 2-2 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Hp 2-2 genotypes were confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was assessed with escalating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test efficacy, Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-2 mice (n = 64) were divided into 4 groups (n = 32 per genotype): sham surgery (n = 8), SAH with no treatment (n = 8), SAH + vehicle (n = 8), and SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg IP every 8 hours; n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-SAH neurobehavioral scores were recorded at 24 hours; animals were perfused; and BAs were processed for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of iNOS and eNOS was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> resulted in higher BA lumen patencies in both genotypes (Hp 1-1: SAH + vehicle, 77.8 ± 3.2% vs SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi>, 91.8 ± 5.9% [mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]; P &lt; .05; Hp 2-2: SAH + vehicle, 67.1 ± 2.0% vs SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi>, 86.9 ± 2.2%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral scores were higher in Hp 2-2 mice treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> (SAH + vehicle, 1.2 ± 0.2 vs SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi>, 2.4 ± 0.2; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of iNOS and eNOS increased in Hp 2-2 mice after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> treatment, but limited sample sizes prevented further statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-Citrulline</z:chebi> was not toxic even at the highest dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-Citrulline</z:chebi> is safe; increases BA patency, neurobehavioral scores, and NOS expression in Hp 2-2 mice after SAH; and is a potential agent for treatment of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
