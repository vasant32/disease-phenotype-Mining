<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neurological emergencies are common and frequently devastating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Every year, millions of Americans suffer an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, severe traumatic brain injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, or spinal cord injury severe enough to require medical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Full evaluation of the diseases in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting often requires advanced diagnostics, and treatment frequently necessitates transfer to specialized centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delays in diagnosis and/or treatment may result in worsened outcomes; therefore, optimization of diagnostics is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Point-of-care (POC) testing brings advanced diagnostics to the patient's bedside in an effort to assist medical providers with real-time decisions based on real-time information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>POC testing is usually associated with blood tests (blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, troponin, etc.), but can involve imaging, medical devices, or adapting existing technologies for use outside of the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noticeably missing from the list of current point-of-care technologies are real-time bedside capabilities that address neurological emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unfortunately, the lack of these technologies may result in delayed identification of patients of these devastating conditions and contribute to less aggressive therapies than is seen with other disease processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Development of time-dependent technologies appropriate for use with the neurologically ill patient are needed to improve therapies and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: POC-CENT is designed to support the development of novel ideas focused on improving diagnostic or prognostic capabilities for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eligible examples include biomarkers of traumatic brain injury, non-invasive measurements of intracranial pressure or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and improved detection of pathological bacteria in suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
