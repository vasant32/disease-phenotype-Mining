<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) pathway is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a vital role in regulating growth, proliferation, survival, and protein synthesis among cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the role of the mTOR pathway following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> brain injury--specifically investigating its ability to mediate the activation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we investigated whether key signaling pathway molecules such as the mTOR, P70S6K1, and 4E-BP1 play a role in the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty dogs were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham, SAH (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>), SAH+DMSO (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>), SAH+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi> and SAH+AZD8055 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An established canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH was used by injecting autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna on days 0 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed at days 0 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical behavior, histology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot of mTOR, P70S6K1, 4E-BP1 and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) in the basilar arteries were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the SAH and SAH+DMSO groups, severe angiographic vasospasm was obtained (34.3±19.8%, 38.4±10.3) compared with that in Sham (93.9±5.0%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>mTOR, P70S6K1, 4E-BP1 and PCNA increased in the sample of spastic basilar arteries (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the SAH+RAPA and SAH+AZD8055 groups, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi> and AZD8055 attenuated angiographic vasospasm (62.3±15.9% and 65.2±10.3%) while improving appetite and activity scores (p&lt;0.05) on days 5 through 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi> and AZD8055 significantly reduced the level and expression of mTOR, P70S6K1, 4E-BP1 and PCNA (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study suggests that the mTOR molecular signaling pathway plays a significant role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH, and that inhibition of the mTOR pathway has the potential to become an attractive strategy to treat vasospasm following SAH </plain></SENT>
