<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Considerable controversy exists regarding the choice of balloon used for performing angioplasty as treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of compliant and noncompliant balloons on angiographic and clinical outcomes among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> who underwent balloon angioplasty were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, rate of angiographic recurrence, and occurrence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the affected vessel distribution were compared between arteries treated using different balloons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 30 patients underwent a first-time angioplasty using compliant (n = 34) or noncompliant (n = 51) balloons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At admission, patients were classified Hunt and Hess grade I to III (n = 20) and Hunt and Hess grade IV to V (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fisher grades in patients were I (n = 1), II (n = 3), III (n = 20), and IV (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the rate of angiographic recurrence (32% vs 53%; P = .14), need for repeat angioplasty (21% vs 20%; P = .97), and occurrence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the affected arterial distribution (21% vs 10% P = .39) were observed with compliant and noncompliant balloons, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent of the balloon type, a significant reduction in the need for repeat angioplasty was observed when the initial angioplasty resulted in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or supranormal diameter compared with a subnormal diameter (63.5% vs 36.5%; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No clear difference was observed between compliant and noncompliant balloons for therapeutic angioplasty in preventing angiographic recurrence or the need for repeat angioplasty in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An immediate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or supranormal vessel diameter after the first-time angioplasty resulted in a significant reduction in the need for repeat angioplasty </plain></SENT>
