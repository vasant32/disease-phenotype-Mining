<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After intraluminal treatment with saponin to remove the endothelium, the monophasic constrictions to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha were potentiated, while those to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (alpha 1-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) and 5-hydroxytryptamine were not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Xylazine (alpha 2-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> induced a constriction preceded by a small dilation in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response to xylazine was not modified, while the constriction to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> was augmented after endothelium removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bradykinin, substance P and vasopressin caused a dilation in lower doses, and a dilation followed by a secondary constriction in higher doses in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dilations to these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were reduced and the constrictions were enhanced after endothelial removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">Adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> produced a biphasic response, i.e., a dilation followed by a constriction, which was occasionally preceded by a small constriction in higher doses, and only the dilation in lower doses was attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The monophasic dilation to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> was potentiated, while the papaverine-induced dilation was not influenced by endothelial removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After extraluminal treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, the dilations to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9546">thimerosal</z:chebi> were attenuated, while the constriction to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> was enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The dilations to substance P and vasopressin were depressed, and the constrictions were potentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The monophasic dilation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> was augmented, while that to papaverine was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the endothelium may play important roles not only in producing endothelium-derived relaxing factors but also in modulating the calcium influx into the smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of altered responsiveness might be implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
