<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of nicardipine started before or immediately after early operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dosage was from 4 to 10 mg/h with an average of 7.4 mg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration was from 2 to 17 days with an average of 12.3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm was observed in only one (3%) out of 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 32 patients (97%) showed neither ischemic symptoms nor low-density areas on computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe angiographical vasospasm was diagnosed in 3 patients, who entered hospital on day 3 to 5 after initial attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were operated upon on day 4 to 6 under the administration of nicardipine before or immediately after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patients showed symptomatic vasospasm and angiographical vasospasm was improved markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that high dose nicardipine appeared to prevent both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and angiographical vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
