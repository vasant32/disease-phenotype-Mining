<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to further characterize the stimuli that can activate recombinant eNOS enzyme expressed in the adventitia of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To stimulate recombinant eNOS, we used serum (0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1-10%), substance P (10(-11)-3 x 10(-9) M), and ANG II (10(-7)-10(-5) M) because they increase intracellular calcium concentrations in fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-denuded segments of canine basilar arteries were incubated with an adenoviral vector encoding beta-galactosidase gene or eNOS gene for 30 min at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, vasomotor activity and cGMP formation in eNOS or beta-galactosidase arteries were examined by isometric force recording and by radioimmunoassay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control arteries and beta-galactosidase gene-transduced arteries, serum caused concentration-dependent contractions, whereas in recombinant eNOS gene-transduced arteries, serum produced concentration-dependent relaxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Substance P and ANG II had no effect on vascular tone in control and beta-galactosidase arteries but caused concentration-dependent relaxations as well as a significant increase in cGMP levels in eNOS arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These relaxations were blocked by the NOS inhibitor NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chemical treatment or mechanical inactivation of adventitial function significantly attenuated substance P-induced relaxations and ANG II-induced relaxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that serum, substance P, and ANG II cause adventitia-dependent relaxations in cerebral arteries expressing the recombinant eNOS gene </plain></SENT>
