<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Free radical generation following <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> of a subarachnoid blood clot is believed to be a key component in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histidine, an essential amino acid with free radical scavenging characteristics, was examined for its effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An experimental rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-induced vasospasm was used in which autologous arterial blood was injected into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were removed following perfusion-fixation two days after the injection of blood, and their cross-sectional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> areas were measured using computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rabbits received intravenous injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15971,29979">L-histidine</z:chebi> or vehicle starting 30 min prior to induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), with additional injections given four times per day for the next 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area of arteries from animals treated with histidine (50 mg/kg/dose or 100 mg/kg/dose) were significantly larger than those from vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to the SAH-only groups (mean cross-sectional area = 106.8 x 10(3) microns 2), vasoconstriction was attenuated by 31% in the low dose treatment group (180.0 x 10(3) microns 2) and by 52% in the high dose treatment group (227.4 x 10(3) microns 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area of control basilar arteries was 340.5 x 10(3) microns 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that histidine reduces the amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurring subsequent to experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the free radical scavenging characteristics of histidine, particularly its ability to scavenge singlet oxygen, may be responsible for the reduction in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
