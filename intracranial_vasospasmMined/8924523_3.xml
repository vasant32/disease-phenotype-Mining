<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of hemolysate on L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels directly by using patch clamp techniques in freshly isolated single smooth muscle cells from rat basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patch clamp studies revealed a whole-cell current which resembles the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> current reported by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemolysate reduced the amplitude of the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of hemolysate was reversible by washout and repeatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemolysate was separated into two fractions by using filter membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fraction &gt; 1 kDa which contains <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and other proteins mimicked the effect of hemolysate, while the fraction &lt; 1 kDa and ATP were without effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that hemolysate does not increase [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i by activation of L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
