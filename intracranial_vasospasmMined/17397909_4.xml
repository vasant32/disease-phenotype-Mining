<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vasospasm is a frequent complication in the early clinical course after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although various methods have been used to measure cerebral perfusion including PET, SPECT, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT, and TCD, these require the patients to remain still for a long period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, TCD is operator dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to clarify the convenience of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> for the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients with SAH aged 44 to 85 years (mean, 64 years) were recruited with informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with the prevailing therapy and underwent <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> on days 6 to 9, followed by DSA and 3D-CTA to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each patient, we measured the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, CBF, and CBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reliability of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> data was verified by comparing the data from <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT between the controls, and the average was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six ROIs were located symmetrically in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> value more than 20% greater than the average indicated the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and patients with vasospasm-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> exhibited an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> more than 47% greater than the mean value (odds ratio, 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with delayed cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had a significantly lower mean CBF and CBV and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> than patients who did not develop CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant correlations between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and CBF values and neurovascular findings were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography perfusion can be performed in a short time and on a regular basis, and it therefore has the potential to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> because of SAH </plain></SENT>
