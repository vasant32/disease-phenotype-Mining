<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) can attenuate the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms for this beneficial effect are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAH-induced endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may trigger, aggravate, and maintain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, tried to analyze whether rhEPO administration influenced the endothelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another aim of the current study was to investigate the modulation of rhEPO on the activity of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which played an important role in the signaling of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 rabbits were randomly divided into four groups; control group, SAH group, SAH+vehicle group, and SAH+rhEPO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SAH animals were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rhEPO was administered i.p. starting 5 min after the induction of SAH on day 0 and repeated every 8 h for 120 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries were extracted on day 5 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, we found that administration of rhEPO could activate JAK2 and STAT3 in the basilar artery and decrease the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index of endothelial cells following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl-2 and bcl-xL were up-regulated after the injections of rhEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the therapeutic effect of rhEPO on the subsequent vasospasm after SAH may relate to its inhibition on the endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the cerebral arteries, which may be mediated in part by JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
