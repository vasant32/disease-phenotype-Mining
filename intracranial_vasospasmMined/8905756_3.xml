<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and alterations in endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> have been hypothesized to contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, there has been no direct evidence demonstrating the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and delayed arterial narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elaborate the role of the endogenous intracellular <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and electron exchanger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, rat femoral arteries were treated with perivascular application of I-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), which inhibits the synthesis of GSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To determine the dose-response relationship, BSO at doses of 10 to 100 mg/ml, in platelet-rich plasma, was applied for 7 days to rat femoral arteries in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessels were then perfusion-fixed for morphometric analysis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the time course of arterial narrowing, BSO (75 mg/ml) was applied to femoral arteries for 1, 3, 7, or 21 days before histological analysis, as described above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With rats treated with 50 to 100 mg/ml BSO, exogenous GSH (100 mg/kg) was administered, by intraperitoneal injection, daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the mechanism of BSO effects in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), cultured rat aortic SMCs were treated with 1 mmol/l BSO for 24 hours and assayed for intracellular levels of GSH and two products of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control arteries treated with platelet-rich plasma alone, perivascularly administered BSO applied for periods of 1 to 21 days produced sustained and reversible narrowing of rat femoral arteries with a time course, severity, and histological appearance analogous to those observed after perivascular application of whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BSO-induced arterial narrowing was dose-dependent, with 60% reductions in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional area being noted at 75 and 100 mg/ml (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of exogenous GSH slightly inhibited the effect of BSO on arterial narrowing, although the inhibition was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cultured rat aortic SMCs exposed to BSO for 24 hours showed a 70% decrease in intracellular GSH levels (P = 0.03); levels of two products of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenal, were increased by 25% (P = 0.24) and 38% (P = 0.09), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that diminished intracellular levels of GSH may produce delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> arterial narrowing after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The specific mechanism by which GSH levels modulate vasoconstriction remains uncertain but may involve endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity in SMCs </plain></SENT>
