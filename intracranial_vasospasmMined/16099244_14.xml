<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> are implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in SAH-induced vasospasm is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the effect of a highly specific antibody, monoclonal anti-E-selectin antibody, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a new murine SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental SAH was induced in C57Black/6J mice by injecting autogenous blood into the cisterna magna, and anti-E-selectin antibody was administered intravenously immediately after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were killed by perfusion-fixation 24 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameters of anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) were measured after arteries were cast with gelatin and india ink </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral white blood cell count was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average diameters of ACA were reduced by 22% and 25% in the SAH only and SAH plus vehicle groups, respectively, when compared with the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After treatment with 12.5, 4, and 1 microg of anti-E-selectin antibody in mice subject to SAH, the average diameter of ACA was decreased by 9%, 10%, and 22%, respectively, when compared with the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of anti-E-selectin antibody achieved statistical significance at doses of 12.5 and 4 microg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals in the SAH only and SAH plus vehicle groups exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Administration of 12.5, 4, and 1 microg of anti-E-selectin antibody reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, and the total white blood cell count obtained in animals treated with 12.5- and 4-microg doses were significantly higher as compared with SAH animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence that anti-E-selectin antibody was effective in prevention of SAH-induced vasospasm and imply a possible role of E selectin in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
