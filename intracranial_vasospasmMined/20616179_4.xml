<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review our experiences using <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> infusion for treating medically refractory cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with SAH admitted from July 2003 to January 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 546 patients admitted within 72 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 231 patients (42%) developed symptomatic CV and 189 patients (35%) required endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 346 endovascular sessions were performed consisting of 1 single angioplasty, 286 IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> infusions, and 59 combined treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed on 151 vessel segments, and IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was infused in 720 vessel segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> doses ranged from 2.0 to 30.0 mg per vessel segment and from 3.0 to 55.0 mg per treatment session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeat treatments were necessary in 102 patients (54%) for persistent, recurrent, or worsening CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 6 treatment-related complications, of which 2 resulted in clinical worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were attributable to endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 115 patients (61%) had a good outcome and 55 patients (29%) had a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients died from causes related to SAH, while 3 died from other medical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatments are an integral part of managing patients with medically refractory CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our experience, <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> are safe, with a low complication rate, but further studies are required to determine appropriate patient selection and treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
