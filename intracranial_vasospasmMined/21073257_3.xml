<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The optimal CSF Mg(++) concentration for vasodilation of spastic cerebral arteries after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and its duration are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The temporal profile of the vasodilatory effect and optimal CSF Mg(++) concentration after the intracisternal injection of MgSO(4) solution were investigated in an SAH model in canines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was induced by experimental SAH using a 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in 26 female beagles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, 0.5 ml/kg of 15, 10, 5, or 0 mmol/L MgSO(4) in Ringer solution was injected into the cerebellomedullary cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on Day 1 (before SAH) and before and 1, 3, and 6 hours after the intracisternal injection on Day 7 to measure arterial diameters of the basilar artery (BA), superior cerebellar artery (SCA), and vertebral artery (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid Mg(++) was also measured at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial diameters of the BA, SCA, and VA were significantly decreased by vasospasm on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial diameter ratios (ratio of arterial diameter after MgSO(4) injection to diameter before injection on Day 7) of the BA and SCA at 1 and 3 hours after and the VA at 1 hour after intracisternal injection of the MgSO(4) solution were positively correlated with the CSF Mg(++) concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> arterial diameter ratios, except 1 point of the SCA, exceeded 1 if the CSF Mg(++) concentration was &gt; 3 mEq/L at 1 hour after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals with CSF Mg(++) concentrations &gt; 3 mEq/L at 1 hour after injection (11 dogs) showed significantly increased arterial diameters of the BA at 1 and 3 hours after and of the SCA and VA at 1, 3, and 6 hours after injection, as compared with the diameters before injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CSF Mg(++) concentration significantly increased at 1 hour (3.73 ± 0.69 mEq/L, p &lt; 0.01) and 3 hours (2.05 ± 0.35 mEq/L, p &lt; 0.01) after the intracisternal injection as compared with the baseline value (1.41 ± 0.20 mEq/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reversible effect of an intracisternal injection of MgSO(4) solution on the spastic artery requires CSF Mg(++) concentrations &gt; 3 mEq/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The vasodilatory effect continues for 3-6 hours after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the continuous infusion or intermittent intracisternal injection of MgSO(4) is needed to maintain the optimal CSF Mg(++) concentration and constantly ameliorate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
