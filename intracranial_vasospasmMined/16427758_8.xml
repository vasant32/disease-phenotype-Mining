<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, a medical complication of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, even after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has been secured surgically or endovascularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence accumulated during the last decade suggest that scavenging a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-)), and activating a strong vasoconstructor, protein kinase C (PKC), are the two most important mechanisms in the pathogenesis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim in this study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36281">caffeic acid</z:chebi> phenethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (CAPE), a non-toxic oxygen free radical scavenger, prevents vasospasm in an experimental rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty eight rats (225-250 g) were divided into four groups equally: group 1, control group; group 2, SAH group; group 3, SAH plus placebo group; and group 4, SAH plus CAPE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used double haemorrhage method for SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting 6h after SAH, 10 micromol/kg CAPE or an equal volume of 0.9% saline were administered by intraperitoneal injection twice daily for 5 days to SAH plus CAPE and SAH plus placebo groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CAPE or 0.9% saline injections were continued up to 5th day after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed on the 5th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain sections at the level of the pons were examined by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made for the cross-sectional areas of the lumen and the vessel wall (intimae plus media) of basilar artery by a micrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) were measured in rat brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of CAPE significantly attenuated the vasoconstriction of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were marked narrowing in the lumens of and thickening in the walls of basilar arteries in the SAH, and the SAH plus placebo compared with CAPE group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also observed that CAPE administration significantly decreased the tissue level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, while significantly increased the tissue levels of GSH, NO in the SAH plus CAPE group compared to only SAH group, p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CAPE is effective in attenuating delayed cerebral vasoconstriction following experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest that the elevation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and reduction of NO bioavailability, resulting from the generation and the interaction of free radicals, have a significant role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
