<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A "double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>" canine model of the disease was used (n = 17 dogs), and the degree of vasospasm of the basilar artery was assessed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mongrel dogs of either sex were divided into three experimental groups: animals treated with daily intracisternal injections of BQ-123 (10(-4) M; n = 6) or phosphoramidon (2 x 10(-4) M; n = 6) and control animals treated with saline solution (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diameter of basilar arteries in animals treated with saline solution was reduced by SAH to 56 +/- 7% of control diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BQ-123 and phosphoramidon did not significantly affect SAH-induced vasospasm (diameters were 62 +/- 0% and 56 +/- 10% of control diameters for BQ-123 and phosphoramidon, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in isolated canine basilar arteries BQ-123 (10(-5) M) selectively inhibited concentration-dependent contractions to ET-1 (10(-11)-3 x 10(-8) M; n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of immunoreactive ET in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were not affected by development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
