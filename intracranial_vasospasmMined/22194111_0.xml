<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL and METHODS: Twenty-one New Zealand white rabbits were assigned to one of three groups: group 1 (control), group 2 (SAH only), group 3 (SAH+ALA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ALA was administered (100 mg/kg/day, single dose, intraperitoneally) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rabbits were sacrificed 72 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery lumen areas, arterial wall thickness and endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a cross section of basilar artery were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tissue <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, SOD, GSH-Px levels were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The elevated tissue <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels after SAH were significantly reduced by ALA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduced tissue SOD and GSH-Px levels after SAH were also elevated by ALA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group the average wall thickness and the mean percentages of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index) were reduced and the average cross-sectional areas of the basilar artery were increased statistically significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ALA treatment attenuates the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by its strong <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, antivasospastic and antiapoptotic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ALA may potentially serve as agents in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
