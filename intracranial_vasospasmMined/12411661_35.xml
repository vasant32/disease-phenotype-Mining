<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the toxicity and efficacy of a locally delivered NO donor from a controlled-release polymer in preventing experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rats and rabbits, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30629">Diethylenetriamine</z:chebi>/NO (DETA/NO) was incorporated into controlled release <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="46916">vinyl acetate</z:chebi> (EVAc) polymers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight rats were used in a dose-escalation toxicity study to establish a maximally tolerated dose of DETA/NO-EVAc polymer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the efficacy experiment, 20 rabbits were assigned to 4 experimental groups (n=5 per group): sham operation; SAH only; SAH+empty EVAc polymer; and SAH+DETA/NO-EVAc polymer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated 30 minutes after blood deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery lumen patency was assessed 72 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> to evaluate the efficacy of DETA/NO in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the toxicity study, a dose of 3.4 mg/kg was identified as the LD(20) (dose with 20% mortality during the study period) of this DETA/NO formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain histology revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and ischemic changes at the implantation site associated with high concentrations of DETA/NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the efficacy study, treatment with DETA/NO-EVAc polymer resulted in a significant decrease in basilar artery vasospasm compared with no treatment (93.0+/-4.9% versus 71.4+/-11.9%; P=0.035) or compared with treatment with blank EVAc polymer (93.0+/-4.9% versus 73.2+/-6.4%; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Local delivery of DETA/NO prevents vasospasm in the rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Local delivery of DETA/NO via polymers is a safe and effective strategy for preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in this model </plain></SENT>
