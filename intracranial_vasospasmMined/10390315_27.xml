<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The delayed type of cerebral vasoconstriction known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (DCV) remains an important cause of permanent neurological injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> despite best current medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of DCV remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new treatment for refractory DCV using intrathecally delivered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> and results in 21 patients is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Candidates for treatment were patients with secured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> presenting with clinical or radiographic SAH of grade 3 or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with and without established DCV were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 57% (12/21 patients) the diagnosis of severe DCV refractory to conventional treatment (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHH</z:e> therapy and nimodipine) was established before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients received ITSNP prophylactically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with established DCV were in grave neurological condition before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedures for vasospasm reversal were performed under simultaneous angiographic control with extensive hemodynamic and neurophysiologic monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ITSNP was delivered by intraventricular or subdural catheter or by direct intraoperative suffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>End points of intervention for established DCV were (1) durable angiographic reversal of vasoconstriction, (2) failure to effect reversal within 30 minutes, and (3) adverse effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>End points for DCV prevention were (1) post-SAH day 10 without evidence of vasoconstriction and (2) adverse effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angioplasty was used concomitantly in 9 treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The total number of treatments recorded was 171 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall neurological outcome was good or excellent in 76% of patients (16/21) overall and in 88.9% of patients (16/18) having at least a 1-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 patients with less-than-good outcome, 4 had presented initially with severe neurological injury (clinical SAH grade 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated reversal or amelioration of vasoconstriction in 83% (5/6 cases) of established DCV treated by ITSNP alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Among patients treated prophylactically, none developed clinical DCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ITSNP is a safe and potentially effective treatment for established DCV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> refractory to conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results of prophylactic treatment are also favorable with regard to safety </plain></SENT>
