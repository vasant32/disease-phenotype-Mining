<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: A better understanding of the pathophysiology of vasospasm-induced delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and earlier detection of hypoperfusion before ischemic injury are needed to guide therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of the major arterial territories differs from that of the watershed zones (WZs) in a way that would suggest a differential topographic sensitivity of the brain to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of the study was to investigate the vasospasm-induced hypoperfusion in relation to cerebrovascular topography and timing from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one patients were prospectively enrolled and scheduled for perfusion-weighted (PW) CT at 3 time points (â‰¤ 3 days, Days 4-8, and Days 9-15 after SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted CT maps were visually assessed for side-to-side perfusion asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PW CT topographic pattern was categorized into absence of asymmetry, WZ, and vascular territory hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted CT revision was performed by investigators blinded to clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The null hypothesis for the primary end point was that there would be no difference in hypoperfusion space-time distribution among the different vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> occurred in 26 patients and its predicting variables were increasing age (p = 0.045), Fisher grade (p = 0.007), and hypoperfusion on the PW CT performed within the 1st 72 hours after SAH (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The timing of the PW CT with respect to the day of SAH affected the topographic pattern of hypoperfusion: watershed-zone hypoperfusion was more common within the first 3 days after SAH (p = 0.018), while the proportion of territorial hypoperfusion increased subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the different covariates, a young age was independently associated with a higher risk of developing hypoperfusion in the WZs (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the existence of a cerebral topographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> to the hemodynamic effects of SAH and differential pathogenetic mechanisms of hypoperfusion according to timing, age, and brain topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion in the WZs may be an early precursor to more profound ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The PW CT detection of such brain-sensitive zones could offer a warning signal of the early hemodynamic effects of SAH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
