<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of intraarterial infusion of papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) in an experimental model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and to measure the mean blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven Japanese monkeys were divided into three groups: those studied 3 days-after surgery (the third-day group, n = 3); those studied 7 days after surgery (the seventh-day group, n = 3); and a control group (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was induced in the experimental groups by placing a blood clot in the subarachnoid space around the top of the internal carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) was infused (over 60 minutes) into the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vascular diameters of the ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were measured on angiograms before and after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean blood flow velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was measured on transcranial Doppler sonograms before and 24 hours after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After fixation, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was dissected out, stained, and examined microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After vasospasm induction, both arteries were narrowed more than 30% in the third-day group and more than 50% in the seventh-day group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> infusion in both groups, vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of about 20% was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean increase in blood flow velocity in the third-day group (30%) was smaller than in the seventh-day group (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean blood flow velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> decreased by about 30% in both groups, but increased again after 24 hours nearly to the level before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intimal layer was more corrugated in the seventh-day group, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in the smooth muscle layer was also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination showed no neurologic deficit in the third-day group 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> infusion; neurologic deficits were observed in the seventh-day group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> infusion may be more effective in early stages of vasospasm when vascular walls have fewer histologic changes </plain></SENT>
