<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is most commonly manifested by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100704'>Cortical blindness</z:hpo> and speech and motor disturbances can also occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes seen in cerebral white matter on imaging studies are nonenhancing areas of hypoattenuation on CT and T2 prolongation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report three cases of CsA-induced neurotoxicity in which reversible changes were observed in the cerebral white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first patient, CsA neurotoxicity occurred 1 week following orthotopic liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second patient, CsA neurotoxicity coincided with an episode of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> 4 weeks after cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> 1 month after heart/lung transplantation for cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A current theory postulates a relationship between diminished serum cholesterol and CsA neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This theory, however, does not satisfactorily address <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of CsA neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, serum cholesterol measurements were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in cases 2 and 3 and probably were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in case 1, despite diminished cholesterol levels preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the matter of CsA-induced neurotoxicity remains unresolved, we suggest that endothelin, a newly described neuropeptide that causes intense vasoconstriction and that has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, may potentiate CsA-induced damage to endothelium and promote CsA neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
