<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A drug delivery system using copoly (lactic/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17497">glycolic acid</z:chebi>) was developed for the intrathecal administration of nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This system was tested to determine its efficacy in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rod-shaped implant (1-mm diameter, 10-mm long and which contained approximately 10% of nicardipine) was prepared by a heat compression method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In in vitro studies, 8% of the actual nicardipine loaded was released during day 1, 17% within day 2, 62% within day 4, and 96% within day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In in vivo studies, 12 dogs were assigned to two groups: the placebo group and the group treated with nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography before the experiment was performed followed by right craniectomy and induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> by the placement of a clot in the Sylvian fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight pellets, either containing 8 mg of nicardipine or without nicardipine were placed in the cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 7, the angiography was repeated and cerebrospinal fluid was removed from the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The animals were then sacrificed, and the brain and blood clot were taken out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vessels were measured three times with a calibrated optical micrometer, and the mean value was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Average reduction of vessel diameters on the clot side in the placebo and nicardipine groups were -37% and -10% on the internal carotid (IC), -48% and -3% on the middle cerebral (MC), and -28% and -1% on the anterior cerebral artery (AC), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in vessel diameters of IC (p &lt; 0.05), MC (p &lt; 0.005), and AC (p &lt; 0.05) between these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No vasospasm was found in the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The nicardipine concentration in the clot was determined by high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of nicardipine in the clot was 1.5 x 10(-4)M, at which concentration sufficient relaxation is evoked in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The pellets did not last beyond day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Regarding the histological findings, there was a marked difference in vessel diameters between the placebo and the nicardipine treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The arteries were surrounded with red blood cells and inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There were no specific changes related to the pellets and no sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A prolonged-release preparation of nicardipine that can be implanted intracranially at the time of surgery prevented vasospasm significantly in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this new drug delivery system might be put into effect favorably in patients suffering from vasospasm due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
