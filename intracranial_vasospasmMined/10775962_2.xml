<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyze the effect of intravenous nicardipine on the prevention and treatment of posttraumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind pilot study of the effect of nicardipine (intravenously 5 mg/hour for one week) on patients with moderate or severe head injury who presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, defined as an average Doppler flow velocity (DFV) of 100 cm/second or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main variable assessed was the evolution of the DFV and the secondary criteria were the evolution of the arterial blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scales, the findings on the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale and the safety of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients were included in each homogeneous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DFV was found to have become <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on the first day of treatment with nicardipine and on the third day with the placebo (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the first day of treatment the percentage of cerebral hemispheres diagnosed as having suspected spasm was 11.1% for nicardipine and 64.3% for the placebo (p = 0.02881) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average time for recovery (DFV &lt; 100 cm/second) was 3.33 days with the placebo and 1.22 days with nicardipine (p = 0.0039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients treated with nicardipine had 8.89 times more chance of recovery from vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse effects was greater with the placebo (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nicardipine is effective in the reversal and prevention of increased Doppler flow velocity in patients with moderate or severe head injury </plain></SENT>
