<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent reports have demonstrated the high utility of transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS) in the diagnosis of advanced spasm of the middle cerebral artery, whereas its accuracy in the diagnosis of mild vasospasm is reported to be lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relation of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) to that in the extracranial internal carotid artery (VMCA/VICA index) is recommended as being helpful in the diagnosis of vasospasm (the so called Lindegaard Index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the exact diagnostic value of this index using the TCCS method remains to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to estimate the accuracy of TCCS in the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> vasospasm, as based on the VMCA/VICA index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The VMCA/VICA index was calculated in 195 patients (285 middle cerebral arteries) who were scheduled for cerebral arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TCCS study and color-coded duplex sonography of the internal carotid arteries were performed immediately before arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A mild grade of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> spasm was diagnosed angiographically in 21, and moderate-to-severe spasm in 29 MCAs out of 285 successfully insonated arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak-systolic, mean and end-diastolic blood velocities were measured using transcranial color sonography in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and related to the respective velocities in the ipsilateral extracranial internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) were calculated for particular velocities and for the related VMCA/VICA indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By comparison of the areas under the ROC curves it was shown that the use of the VMCA/VICA index does not improve the accuracy of TCCS in the diagnosis of advanced <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> spasm, whereas it improves accuracy in the diagnosis of mild vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, accuracy can be improved by the use of the VMCA/VICA index based on the end-diastolic velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The optimal diagnostic threshold of the VMCA/VICA index was determined at 3.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of VMCA/VICA index improves the accuracy of TCCS in the diagnosis of mild vasospasm of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
