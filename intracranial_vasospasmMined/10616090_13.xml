<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The reduction in the level of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is a purported mechanism of delayed vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence in support of a causative role for NO includes the disappearance of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) from the adventitia of vessels in spasm, the destruction of NO by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> released from the clot into the subarachnoid space, and reversal of vasospasm by intracarotid NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to establish whether administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, the substrate of the NO-producing enzyme NOS, would reverse and/or prevent vasospasm in a primate model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was composed of two sets of experiments: one in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> was infused over a brief period into the carotid artery of monkeys with vasospasm, and the other in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> was intravenously infused into monkeys over a longer period of time starting at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the short-term infusion experiment, the effect of a 3-minute intracarotid infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (intracarotid concentration 10(-6) M) on the degree of vasospasm of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was examined in five cynomolgus monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the long-term infusion experiment, the effect of a 14-day intravenous infusion of saline (control group, five animals) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (10(-3) M; six animals) on the occurrence and degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was examined in monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments was assessed by cerebral arteriography, which was performed preoperatively and on postoperative Days 7 (short and long-term infusion experiments) and 14 (long-term infusion experiment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the long-term infusion experiment, plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> were measured at these times in the monkeys to confirm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was not affected by the intracarotid infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (shown by the reduction in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area on an anteroposterior arteriogram compared with preoperative values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, intracarotid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion increased rCBF by 21% (p &lt; 0.015; PCO2 38-42 mm Hg) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vasospastic monkeys compared with rCBF measured during the saline infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the long-term infusion experiment, vasospasm of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occurred with similar intensity with or without continuous intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> on Day 7 and had resolved by Day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> level increased during infusion from 12.7+/-4 microg/ml on Day 0 to 21.9+/-13.1 microg/ml on Day 7 and was 18.5+/-3.1 microg/ml on Day 14 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brief intracarotid and continuous intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> did not influence the incidence or degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After SAH, intracarotid infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> markedly increased rCBF in a primate model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings discourage the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> as a treatment for vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
