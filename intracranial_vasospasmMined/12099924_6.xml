<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyse and compare retrospectively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and ischaemic infarction, as well as neurological deficits and outcome within a large population of clipped and coiled patients with ruptured and unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within a 2-year period, a total of 144 interventions (53 clipping/91 coiling) entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daily bilateral transcranial Doppler sonographic monitoring was performed to observe vasospasm development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cerebral computed tomography (cCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were reviewed with respect to occurrence and localization of ischaemic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal neurological deficits were recorded and clinical outcome was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis included the use of multivariate logistic regression models to find determinants of vasospasm, ischaemic infarction and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, vasospasm was detected after 77 (53.5%) interventions, 61.8% in females (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clipped patients significantly more often exhibited vasospasms (69.8 vs. 44.0%, P &lt; 0.005) and were treated 1 week longer at the intensive care unit (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients (53.5%) developed ischaemic infarctions, 62.3% after clipping and 48.4% after coiling (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>-rupture was the strongest predictor for vasospasm and vasospasm was the strongest predictor for infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits at discharge (46.5%) were independent of treatment modality, the same applied for the mean Glasgow Outcome Scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mortality between surgical and endovascular treatment (9.4 vs. 12.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whilst the vasospasm incidence was significantly higher after surgical treatment, ischaemic infarctions were only slightly more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incidence of neurological deficits and clinical outcome was similar in both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
