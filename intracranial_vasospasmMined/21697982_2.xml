<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) refractory to medical management can be treated with intra-arterial administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, but valid bedside monitoring for the diagnosis and therapeutic assessment is poorly available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the successful application of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) monitoring with multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in assisting intra-arterial infusions of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> to a patient suffering from post-SAH vasospasm in the distal vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man presented with SAH and intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> due to ruptured right middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and right-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> on day 9 after SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> attributable to diffuse vasospasm in the distal territories of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the symptoms persisted despite maximal hyperdynamic therapy with dobutamine, intra-arterial fasudil treatment in the setting of rSO(2) monitoring including the spasm-affected vascular territory with four-channel flexible NIRS sensors was subsequently performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased and fluctuating rSO(2) in angiographically documented vasospastic territories increased immediately after intra-arterial fasudil infusion in accordance with relief of vasospasm that correlated with neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure was repeated on day 11 since the effect was transient and neurological deterioration and reduction of rSO(2) recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deficits resolved accompanied by uptake and maintenance of rSO (2) following the intra-arterial fasudil, resulting in favorable functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Continuous rSO(2) monitoring with multichannel NIRS is a feasible strategy to assist intraarterial fasudil therapy for detecting and treating the focal ischemic area exposed to diffuse vasospasm </plain></SENT>
