<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the use of a primate model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, 12 female cynomolgous monkeys underwent the induction of a SAH by the direct placement of an average 6.4-ml autologous <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> against the major anterior cerebral vessels in the right basal subarachnoid spaces (Day 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were then randomized to one of four groups and within 14 to 20 hours after clot placement were started on oral q8h therapy with nimodipine (3, 6, or 12 mg/kg) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, the animals were killed and the right and left middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) were immediately resected and placed in oxygenated Krebs' solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ring preparations from the arteries were suspended in organ baths, and dose-effect curves to varying concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant reduction in the response of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on the clot side (right) relative to the nonclot side (left) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clot side contractility was not influenced by nimodipine treatment at any of the four doses tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nonclot side arteries of the 12-mg/kg treatment group demonstrated significantly enhanced reactivity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral treatment with high dose nimodipine enhances the reactivity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral vessels to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> tested, but it does not seem to affect the reactivity of arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> spasm at any of the four doses tested </plain></SENT>
