<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A large body of evidence suggests a substantial role of the endothelin (ET) system in the pathophysiology of a variety of <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, mainly of the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi>, an ET receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, has received approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary artery hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ET system may also be involved in cerebrovascular disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and, most notably, development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the development of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> may be taken as a paradigm to explore mechanisms leading to secondary ischemic brain damages in a variety of insults such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present review provides the evidence to evaluate ET receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> for potential prophylactic and therapeutic use in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rationale to develop selective <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> is given with respect to basic and applied studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may be useful to better define the desired profile of action of a given compound, and it may also help to design appropriate preclinical and clinical trials, most desirably in close cooperation with pharmaceutical companies and neurosurgical departments </plain></SENT>
