<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was twofold, i.e., to ascertain whether endothelial and nonendothelial NO modulates the contractile response of cerebral arteries to ET-1 and to analyze whether this relationship might be impaired after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rings of middle cerebral artery from goats in the control group and from goats with SAH were set up for isometric tension recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced 3 days before the experiments by infusion of 10 ml of autologous arterial blood through a catheter previously inserted into the subarachnoid space (basal cistern) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In goats in the control group, the response to ET-1 was obtained as follows: 1) in control arteries (unrubbed and nonincubated arteries); 2) in rubbed arteries (arteries in which the endothelium was mechanically removed); 3) during incubation with NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (L-NOArg) alone or plus L- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15816">D-arginine</z:chebi>; and 4) in rubbed arteries plus incubation with L-NOArg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In goats with SAH, that response was obtained in control arteries, rubbed arteries, and during incubation with L-NOArg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specimens of middle cerebral artery were processed for transmission electron microscopy study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In goats in the control group, ET-1 elicited concentration-dependent contraction of the middle cerebral artery that was significantly potentiated after endothelium denudation or during incubation with L-NOArg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter effect was reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15816">D-arginine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined endothelium denudation and incubation with L-NOArg produced a contractile response to ET-1 significantly higher than that induced by each treatment separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hyperreactivity to ET-1 was observed in goats with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endothelium denudation did not alter the enhanced response to ET-1, but it was further significantly increased after incubation with L-NOArg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that an ET-1-NO interaction exists in control cerebral arteries in such a way that endothelial and nonendothelial NO partially counteract the contractile response to ET-1 and that although SAH did not modify the effect of nonendothelial NO, the absence of endothelial NO after SAH may contribute to the hyperreactivity of cerebral arteries to ET-1 and, thereby, to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
