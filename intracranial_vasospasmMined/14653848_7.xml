<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several agents have been suggested as being responsible - amongst these perhaps 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are the most prominent, given their ability to elicit powerful constriction of arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigating both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and ET receptors we observed distinct changes in the receptor phenotype after experimental SAH - namely upregulation of the ETB and 5-HT1B receptors - linked to a higher sensitivity to the endogenous <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This multiple receptor upregulation may explain the failure in treating CVS using single receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, and may also significantly change our understanding of the effector mechanism behind CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So far only the ET and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> receptors have been studied in this regard, but other receptor systems may also undergo changes </plain></SENT>
