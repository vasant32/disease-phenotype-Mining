<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the vasodilatory effects of systemically administered calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> can be limited secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously compared intrathecal and intravenous routes of administration of nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal administration of nicardipine significantly dilated spastic basilar arteries on day 7 in a two-haemorrhage canine model of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present communication, the effects of prophylactic, serial administration of intrathecal nicardipine on vasospasm was examined in 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as Fisher SAH group 3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> clipped within 3 days of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following placement of a cisternal drain, 2 mg of nicardipine was injected, three times each day for an average of 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 91 similar patients with cisternal drainage not treated with nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal administration of nicardipine decreased the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm by 26%, angiographic vasospasm by 20% and increased good clinical outcome at one month after the haemorrhage by 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiograms revealed that patients in the nicardipine group showed less vasospasm of major cerebral arteries, near the tip of a drain in the basal cistern, but vasospasm in the A2 and M2 segments was not decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radio-isotope cisternography suggested that nicardipine might not reach the subarachnoid space around A2 and M2 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine patients complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> probably secondary to nicardipine induced vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, both were successfully treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal administration nicardipine appears to be effective in the treatment of vasospasm, but side effects were significant </plain></SENT>
