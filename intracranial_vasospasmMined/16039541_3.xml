<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Perfusion-weighted computed tomography (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) is a relatively recent innovation that estimates a value for cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a series of axial head CT images tracking the time course of a signal from an intravenous contrast bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> images were obtained using a standard imaging protocol and were analyzed using commercially available software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel computer-based method was used for objective quantification of side-to-side asymmetries of CBF values calculated from <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our method corrects for the inherent variability of the <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> methodology seen in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) patient population to potentially aid in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method analyzes and quantifies side-to-side asymmetry of CBF and presents relative differences in a construct termed a Relative Difference Map (RDM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further automate this process, we have developed a unique methodology that enables a computer to delineate vascular territories within a brain image, regardless of the size and shape of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While both the quantification of image symmetry using RDMs and the automated assignment of vascular territories were initially designed for the analysis of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> images, it is likely that they will be useful in a variety of applications </plain></SENT>
