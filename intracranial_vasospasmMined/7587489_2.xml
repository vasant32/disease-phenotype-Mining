<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a biphasic change of rCBF after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contents of ET in CSF, plasma and hypothalamus rose prominently in the early stage after SAH, and the ET-increase in CSF and hypothalamus was earlier than that in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes of ET contents in CSF correlated well with that in hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that ET probably is an early important factor which induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase of ET in CSF, which may originate from the hypothalamus, might play a more important role in the development of CVS after SAH than that in plasma </plain></SENT>
