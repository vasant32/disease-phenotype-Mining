<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the usefulness of measuring anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPLs) for prediction of the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm and the outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>32 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were admitted and operated on within 72 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>aPLs such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> IgG and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> IgM were measured repeatedly after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, platelet count, platelet aggregability and plasma platelet factor 4 were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven among the 32 patients (34.4%) showed positive in the examination for aPLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although aPLs could not predict symptomatic vasospasm, once symptomatic vasospasm occurred, patients with aPLs frequently demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and therefore their outcome was worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>aPLs were associated with a severe initial clinical grade and SAH grade on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore it may explain the association of aPLs with worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>aPLs were detected between 1 and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four of 6 patients (67%) with aPLs became negative between 7 and 13 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of transient aPLs is unclear but it is more likely to occur in the severer grade patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reduction in platelet count, the increased platelet aggregability, and the increased plasma platelet factor 4 concentration were also observed in aPLs-positive patients with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
