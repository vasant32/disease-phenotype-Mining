<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral microcirculatory changes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) are still controversial and uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to demonstrate that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) augments cerebral cortical microcirculatory blood flow in an experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> model by using Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The experiments were carried out on 24 New Zealand rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three experimental groups were designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 1, Cerebral cortical blood flow (CCoBF) was evaluated by LDF in 8 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 2, Intracisternal saline injection and cervical epidural electrode placement without SCS were performed in 8 animals before LDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 3, LDF was performed before and after SCS on the 4th day of SAH in 8 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CCoBF parameters obtained from LDF data were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The occurrence of vasospasm after SAH was demonstrated with significant changes in LDF values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SAH animals, SCS resulted in significant increase (approximately 30%) in CCoBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This increase was observed to continue even after the cessation of the stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that SCS improves cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to vasospasm after induced SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cervical SCS may constitute a new therapeutic modality in treating disturbed CCoBF due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
