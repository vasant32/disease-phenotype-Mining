<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to clarify the relationship between HIF-1 expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and to characterize the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>)-induced increases in HIF-1 protein levels on the brainstem and the basilar artery (BA) after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat single- and double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> models (injected on Days 0 and 2) of SAH were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the time courses for HIF-1 protein levels in the brainstems and the BA diameters within 10 minutes and 6 hours on Days 1 and 2 in the single-SAH model, and also on Day 7 in the double-SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After induction of double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in rats, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> was injected intraperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated HIF-1 protein expression and brainstem activity, BA diameter, and brainstem blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the rats experienced SAH, HIF-1 protein expression was significantly greater at 10 minutes in the single-injection model and at 7 days in the double-injection model than at similar time points in the control group, and these increases correlated with degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> injection resulted in significant increases in HIF-1 protein expression and activity in the brainstems of rats with SAH, compared with the rats with SAH that were given placebos, and the rats without SAH in the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and reduction of brainstem blood flow were significantly attenuated in the rats that were administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>-induced increase in HIF-1 protein level and activity exerts significant attenuation of BA vasospasm and reduction of brainstem blood flow in the rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> may be a promising agent for treating clinical SAH </plain></SENT>
