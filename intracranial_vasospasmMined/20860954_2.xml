<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is hampered by lack of an accurate, noninvasive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) may be useful but the correlation between arterial diameters determined from catheter digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and CTA over a range of artery sizes would need to be determined to show this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between artery diameters measured on DSA and multidetector CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred forty artery diameters were measured in DSA and CTA from 46 patients who underwent both studies within 12 hours of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Axial cross section, maximum intensity projection, and volume-rendered images were measured and compared by linear correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two independent readers measured CTA diameters to determine interobserver variability by linear correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Values also were categorized and compared by χ(2) and κ statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis was repeated with unmeasurable arteries assigned a value of 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant correlations between arterial diameters measured on DSA and those from CTA measured by any method (R(2) ranging from 0.45 to 0.76, P &lt; .0001), although there was a tendency for the slope of this relationship to be less than 1, indicating underestimation of diameter of large and overestimation of diameter of small arteries with CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic angiography diameters also correlated significantly between the 2 reviewers with higher values often when unmeasureable arteries were assigned a value of 0 (κ = 0.23-0.55, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arterial diameters measured on multidetector CTA correlate well with those determined from DSA and should permit use of CTA for quantitative study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and other conditions requiring accurate measurement of arterial diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The limitation of CTA remains the inability to measure some arteries due to artifact </plain></SENT>
