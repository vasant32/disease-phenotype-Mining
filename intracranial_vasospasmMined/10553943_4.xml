<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HC, methionine and cysteine did not produce any changes in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lowering [Mg2+]o to 0.3 mM resulted in elevation of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and loss of [Mg2+]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of [Mg2+]i, induced by HC, was potentiated by low Mg2+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of these cells with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, alone, did not alter [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i or [Mg2+]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, concomitant addition of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, together with HC (1 mM) did not change the reduction in [Mg2+]i induced by HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, concomitant addition of HC and the three vitamins inhibited completely the loss of [Mg2+]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of these cells to each vitamin, alone, or combination of the three vitamins failed to interfere with reduction in [Mg2+]i induced by low [Mg2+]i, but it did suppress the rise in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in the presence of low [Mg2+]o, the vitamin combination did not retard <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of [Mg2+]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present findings are compatible with the hypothesis that an increased serum HC concentration causes <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>abnormal metabolism</z:mp> of Mg2+ in cerebral VSMC, thus priming these cells for HC-induced atherogenesis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
