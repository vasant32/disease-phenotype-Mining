<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The key role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is increasingly assigned to endothelin (ET)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Constriction of the cerebrovasculature by ET-1 is mainly mediated by the ET(A) receptor but is putatively altered during the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim in the present study was to characterize these alterations, with the emphasis on the ET(A) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was induced using the rat double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model and proven by perfusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed on Day 5 after SAH, and immunohistochemical staining for ET(A), receptors was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The isometric force of basilar artery ring segments with (E+, control group) and without (E-, SAH group) endothelial function was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentration effect curves (CECs) for ET-1 were constructed by cumulative application in the absence and presence of the selective ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> clazosentan (10(-8) or 10(-7) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CEC for E+ segments was significantly shifted to the left after SAH by a factor of 3.7, whereas maximum contraction was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In E- segments, the CECs were not shifted during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> but the maximum contraction was significantly enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory potency of clazosentan yielded a pA2 value of 8.6 +/- 0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of the smooth-muscle layer showed no significant increase of ET(A) receptor expression, but positive staining occurred in the endothelial space after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate an enhanced contractile effect of the smooth-muscle ET(A) receptors in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory potency of clazosentan on this contraction is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some evidence for an ET(A) receptor and an endothelium-dependent vasoactive effect after SAH is provided </plain></SENT>
