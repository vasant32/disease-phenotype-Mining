<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes of systemic parameters following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> conditions created by intracisternal injection of fresh autologous blood in a rabbit model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was carried out at the Neurosurgery Clinic, Izmir Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey between April 2002 and March 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two male rabbits were divided into the following 4 groups: group one with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> received 0.5 cc of blood, group 2 with moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> received 0.7 cc of blood, group 3 with severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> received 1 cc of blood, and the sham-operated group 4 with no blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical parameters of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were monitored 2 hours after the operation, and blood analysis was performed just after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A series of systemic parameters such as rectal temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and blood gas analysis were measured before and after administration of blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were compared by analysis of variance and paired t-tests, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The systolic blood pressures were significantly different in groups 1, 2, and 3 before and after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diastolic blood pressures were also considerably different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the presence of a blood clot and different amounts of blood in the subarachnoid space can evoke a series of changes in both local and systemic states in experimental models </plain></SENT>
