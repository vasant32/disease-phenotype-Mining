<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, this study has investigated the mechanisms involved in <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>-induced relaxation of the canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the vasorelaxant effects of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> were evaluated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>- and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(₂α)-precontracted arterial rings in vitro in the absence or presence of several <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>/inhibitors/blockers; the effect of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> on the contractile responses to CaCl₂ was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> (10-180 μM) produced concentration-dependent relaxations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(₂α)-precontracted arterial rings which were: (i) unaffected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5132">flutamide</z:chebi> (10 μM), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2654">DL-aminoglutethimide</z:chebi> (10 μM), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> (10 μM), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (10 μM), SQ 22,536 (100 μM) or ODQ (30 μM); and (ii) significantly attenuated by the blockers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34385">4-aminopyridine</z:chebi> (K(V); 1 mM), BaCl₂ (K(IR); 30 μM), iberiotoxin (BK(Ca²+); 20 nM), but not by glybenclamide (K(ATP); 10 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (31, 56 and 180 μM) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> (0.01-1 μM) produced a concentration-dependent blockade of the contraction to CaCl₂ (10 μM to 10 mM) in arterial rings depolarized by 60mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results, taken together, show that <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> relaxes the canine basilar artery mainly by blockade of voltage-dependent Ca²+ channels and, to a lesser extent, by activation of K+ channels (K(IR), K(V) and BK(Ca²+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect does not involve genomic mechanisms, production of cAMP/cGMP or the conversion of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> to 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
