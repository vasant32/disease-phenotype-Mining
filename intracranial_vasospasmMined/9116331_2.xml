<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the changes in ANP secretion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SAH was induced by the injection of 100 microliters of unheparinized, autologous blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via a canule formerly inserted into the cisterna magna (CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the sham SAH group the SAH was imitated with 0.9% saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of ANP in the blood samples obtained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages of vasospasm were radioimmunoassayed with commercial RIA kits (Peninsula RIK 9103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that both SAH and sham SAH induced a significant increase in plasma ANP in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No such changes were observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This shows that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH considerably enhances the ANP secretion in SHRs, probably through the increased endothelin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These compensatory and regulatory mechanisms help prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> and the progression of vasopasm through secondary vasodilation </plain></SENT>
