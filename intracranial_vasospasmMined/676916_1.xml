<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence for vasospasm was radiological and pathological in 17 cases and pathological alone in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A histological examination of the large arteries in areas known formerly to be in spasm showed that in the 13 early cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before 3 weeks) there were relevant changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the arterial wall, the most significant being a degeneration of the media and elastica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 7 late cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after 3 weeks), in addition to the sequelae of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes, there was marked concentric intimal thickening; and the localization was again in the particular segments of arteries formerly in spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes found in the small arteries, capillaries, and veins in the early and the late cases were thought to be caused by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were also seen in control material </plain></SENT>
