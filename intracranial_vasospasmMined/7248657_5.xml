<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In situ experiments were therefore undertaken on pial terminal arterioles of rats to determine whether or not perivascular application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> exerts any action on such cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vessel size was assessed with an image-splitting television microscope recording system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vessels studied ranged in size from 25 to 30 micron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> was applied in artificial CSF in dosages of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 2.0 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant dose-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (i.e., 15.7-45.3% increases in lumen sizes) of the pial terminal arterioles was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed in light of current developments concerning the mechanism whereby <z:chebi fb="5" ids="36333">local anaesthetics</z:chebi> alleviate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
