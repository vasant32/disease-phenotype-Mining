<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to monitor cortical extracellular concentrations of energy metabolism markers, such as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, neurotransmitter amino acids, such as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> to identify any neurochemical patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A prospective clinical study was conducted on a group of 16 patients with non-severe SAH operated on within 72 hours after initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, an MD catheter was inserted in the cortical region where vasospasm could be expected to develop, and perfused with artificial CSF at 0.3 microl/min flow rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dialysate was collected every 6 hours and then analyzed on High Performance Liquid Cromatography (HPLC) for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean ECF <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> concentrations ranged from 1.4 + 0.7 to 12.3 + 7.8 micromol/l in single patients: global mean value was 5.8 + 3.8 micromol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this series, the highest absolute <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> value was 25.7 micromol/l, observed in a patient who developed clinical and radiological signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients presented clinical disturbances related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this setting, representing a mild-to-moderate hypoxic condition, MD data demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> is the most sensitive marker of cellular energy imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels positively correlated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.0001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.0001), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.0001) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that also in humans increased <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> levels reflect a condition of cellular stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that MD is a sensitive technique to reveal subtle <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> possibly resulting in cell damage </plain></SENT>
