<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on the previously suggested hypothesis that generation of free radicals leading to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation is involved in the genesis of vasospasm following SAH, the therapeutic effect of an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> on experimental vasospasm was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> suitable for this purpose, AVS(1,2-bis(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="32879">propane</z:chebi>) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH was induced in dogs by intracisternal injection of blood and subsequent changes in the basilar artery diameter was evaluated by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, intrathecal administration of AVS 3 days after SAH caused prompt resolution of pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm for 3-4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, the effect of continuous intravenous administration of saline (control) or AVS was started and continued for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group, early and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> spasm was observed on the daily angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the AVS-treated group, early spasm was only moderately inhibited, but the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> spasm was remarkably suppressed in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, no adverse effect of AVS on the neurological or systemic conditions was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that AVS may be beneficial in the treatment of vasospasm following SAH, thereby reinforcing the concept that generation of free radicals is involved in the genesis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
