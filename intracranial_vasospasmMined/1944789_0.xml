<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is expected to be used for cisternal drainage in subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, for dissolving of the residual <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> after stereotactic evacuation of a cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, and for regional intraarterial injection therapy for occlusion of the primary cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is because the drug exerts a very potent and immediate dissolving-effect on a <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> when it is locally administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the solubility of t-PA is rapidly decreased at pH 5 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At pH 7 or more, precipitation of crystals is observed when the concentration of t-PA exceeds 20 x 10(4) IU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pH of the t-PA general-purpose solution (for intravenous injection) is adjusted at 4.6 to 4.8 because of its solubility and stability, and the osmotic pressure is also increased with an increase in concentration of t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the concentration of t-PA is 750 x 10(4) IU/ml, the osmotic ratio is 30 and the pH is 4.82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These features suggest that a locally administered t-PA solution at high concentration may induce meningeal irritation leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and exacerbation of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> when it is used for cisternal drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the t-PA solution administered intraarterially at high concentration may induce adverse effects such as dessiocyte and echinocyte deformation of erythrocytes and the sludging phenomenon of leukocytes in the cerebral microcirculation, and a sensation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and pain upon injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the dose and method of administration of the t-PA for local intracranial use should be determined by taking into consideration its pH and osmotic pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
