<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present work aimed at examining the effect of tirilazad mesylate (U74006F), a newly developed <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation inhibitor, on the intraluminal narrowing of basilar artery subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in beagle dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 1, an intravenous bolus injection of either vehicle or U74006F (0.5, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg) was repeated every 8 hours after an induction of the first SAH until the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dose of 0.5 mg/kg of U74006F provided the greatest beneficial effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 2, an intravenous infusion of 100 ml of saline containing either vehicle or U74006F (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) was given in the same time schedule as in Experiment 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-SAH treatment of U74006F, at a dosage of approximately 0.5 mg/kg, showed a beneficial effect by infusion as well as by bolus administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that U74006F has an ability to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm in the canine SAH model </plain></SENT>
