<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbits symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> model was built though Endo method, among the 40 rabbits, 8 died or had severe <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system syndrome, the other 32 were randomly divided into 4 groups:group A, control group, injection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline to the cisterna magna;group B, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>;group C, injection of human urinary tissue kallikreins;group D, treated with Nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behavior scores, neurological scores and cerebral angiography changes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Food intake obviously decreased and neurological deficit were seen in group B, while which were attenuated in group C and group D, and group A was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing the diameter of basilar artery was (1.9 +/- 0.3) mm before SAH, the diameter of group B 4 d later was (1.5 +/- 0.3) mm, 7 d later (1.4 +/- 0.3) mm, the difference was significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing with group C on the day 4th and 7th, the diameters of basilar artery were significantly different (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing with group D on the day 4th, 7th and 14th, there was no obvious improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Urinary kallidinogenase and Nimodipine can obviously alleviate symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rabbits remarkably, but the former's effect of attenuating vasospasm is better than that of Nimodipine </plain></SENT>
