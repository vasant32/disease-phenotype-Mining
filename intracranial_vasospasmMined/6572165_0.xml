<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive research no explanation has been put forward to account for the fact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> complicates the course of disease of many but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients suffering from rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although vasoactive material in hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) most probably is of major importance in the pathophysiology of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, recent studies have failed to demonstrate a correlation between CSF vasoconstrictor activity and the development of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study the reactivity of isolated human pial arteries to various vasoactive agents [<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, human plasma and CSF from patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)] was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a very marked variability in the spectrum of responses between arteries from different individuals with regard to the contractile responses to plasma, hemorrhagic CSF and <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the contractions produced by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> were consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The markedly individual profile in terms of reactivity toward vasoactive substances emphasizes the importance of a human cerebral vessel wall factor and may explain the capricious occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
