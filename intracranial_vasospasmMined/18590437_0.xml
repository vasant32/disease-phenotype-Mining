<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER) subtypes ERalpha and -beta and their roles in the E2-mediated preservation of eNOS in SAH remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the effects of SAH on the expression of ERalpha and -beta in the cerebral arteries were clarified, and the receptor roles in the E2-mediated preservation of eNOS expression in SAH were differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> SAH model was induced by 2 autologous blood injections into the cisterna magna of adult male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of SAH on ERalpha and -beta expression was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other rats subcutaneously received implanted Silastic tubes containing corn oil with E2 and daily injections of various doses of an ERalpha- (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-piperidinopyrazole [<z:chebi fb="26" ids="34761">MPP</z:chebi>]) or ERbeta-selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (R,R-tetrahydrochrysene) after the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of ERalpha, ERbeta, eNOS, and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) from basilar arteries were examined using Western blot analysis, and their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ERalpha but not the ERbeta was upregulated in the basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="26" ids="34761">MPP</z:chebi> eliminated E2-mediated effects in SAH, relieved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, preserved eNOS expression, and suppressed iNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> receptor alpha is upregulated in the basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Note that E2 exerts its protective effects through ERalpha-dependent pathways to relieve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and preserve eNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A selective ERalpha <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> may be the drug of choice for the treatment of patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
