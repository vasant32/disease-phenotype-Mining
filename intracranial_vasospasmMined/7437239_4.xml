<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>1 Experiments were performed to determine the effects of fibrin(ogen) degradation products on the following in vitro vascular preparations: rabbit aortic strip, rat aortic strip and human basilar arterial strip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2 Citrated plasma and streptokinase were incubated at 37 degrees C to produce a crude preparation of fibrinogen degradation products and 0.1 ml aliquots were removed at various time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These samples were tested for intrinsic activity and possible interactions with EC50 and threshold concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine on the vascular preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 Enhancement of the responses obtained by both concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine was produced by samples taken throughout the streptokinase incubation period, the maximum effect being seen at 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 The 90 min incubate produced volume-dependent (25-400 microliters) potentiations of the responses developed in the three vascular preparations to the EC50 and threshold concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 It is suggested that fibrin(ogen) degradation products may be involved in the intense vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
