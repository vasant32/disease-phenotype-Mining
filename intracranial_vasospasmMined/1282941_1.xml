<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The responses to intraluminally applied substance P (SP) were examined in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries using the stainless-steel cannula inserting method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In control vessels with intact endothelium, this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> induced a monophasic dilation at lower doses, and a biphasic response, i.e., an initial dilation followed by a secondary constriction at higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After extraluminal treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, the dilation was attenuated and the constriction was augmented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After endothelial removal with intraluminal saponin, the dilation was reduced and the constriction was enhanced significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This potentiated constriction was significantly depressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35544">cyclooxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi>), OKY-046 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor), and nimodipine (a calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>), but not by AA-861 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SP has two distinct effects (an endothelium-dependent dilation and a direct constriction) and that the potentiated constriction in the absence of endothelium may be related to the action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi>, linked with calcium influx into the smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mechanism may be implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
