<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3, may attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> because of its antiplatelet and vasodilatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multicenter prospective randomized trial was conducted to investigate the effect of cilostazol on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods Patients admitted with SAH caused by a ruptured anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> who were in Hunt and Kosnik Grades I to IV and were treated by clipping within 72 hours of SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were enrolled at 7 neurosurgical sites in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were assigned to one of 2 groups: the usual therapy group (control group) or the add-on 100 mg cilostazol twice daily group (cilostazol group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group assignments were done by a computer-generated randomization sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary study end point was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of angiographic vasospasm and new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, clinical outcome as assessed by the modified Rankin scale, and length of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> end points were assessed for the intention-to-treat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results Between November 2009 and December 2010, 114 patients with SAH were treated by clipping within 72 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH and were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients were excluded because no consent was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, 109 patients were randomly assigned to the cilostazol group (n = 54) or the control group (n = 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 13% (n = 7) of the cilostazol group and in 40% (n = 22) of the control group (p = 0.0021, Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of angiographic vasospasm was significantly lower in the cilostazol group than in the control group (50% vs 77%; p = 0.0055, Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic analyses demonstrated that nonuse of cilostazol is an independent factor for symptomatic and angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The incidence of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> was also significantly lower in the cilostazol group than in the control group (11% vs 29%; p = 0.0304, Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes at 1, 3, and 6 months after SAH in the cilostazol group were better than those in the control group, although a significant difference was not shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant difference in the length of hospitalization between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse event occurred during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Oral administration of cilostazol is effective in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with a low risk of severe adverse events </plain></SENT>
