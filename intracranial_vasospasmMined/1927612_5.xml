<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (greater than 0.5 ml) was induced in adult rats via direct injection into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to other previously published models of experimental SAH in rats a much larger amount of blood was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was exposed 72 hours post <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and photographed under controlled conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the artery was assessed by an image analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 50% reduction in diameter was found in 25 rats subjected to SAH as compared to 9 control rats and 4 rats with intracisternal saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that when massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> is induced, and direct measurements of the basilar artery are made, the rat can be used as a reliable model for investigation of SAH induced arterial vasospasm </plain></SENT>
