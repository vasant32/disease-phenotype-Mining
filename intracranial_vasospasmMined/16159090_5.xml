<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety and feasibility of continuous high-dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi>) for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and ischemic cerebral injury has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients presenting to our center within 72 hours of aneurysmalSAH (confirmed by computed tomography [CT] scanning and cerebral angiography) between June 2001 and October 2002 were enrolled in a prospective pilot study in which they received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> as an adjunct to standard SAH management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study patients received an intravenous infusion of 12 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> in a 500-mL solution of 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> administered at a rate of 4.06 mM (or 0.5 g) every hour over a 24-hour period for 10 days to achieve a target predetermined serum Mg range of more than 1.5 to less than 4.0 mM/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> on clinical examination, heart rate, and blood pressure was measured every 2 hours; serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and phenytoin levels were monitored daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included evidence of vasospasm on clinical examination, transcranial Doppler study ((TCD); velocity &gt;or=100 cm/s), or repeat cerebral angiogram obtained within 10 days of SAH; and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score assessment and CT scan evidence of ischemic infarction at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients (mean age: 55 years; range: 39-84 years; 11 males, 8 females) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presenting Hunt Hess grade was II or higher; mean Fisher grade was 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was observed in nine patients (by clinical examination in two, TCD in five, and angiogram in nine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean serum Mg level was 2.7 mM/L (standard deviation: +/- 0.37) and was maintained during the infusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No clinical adverse effects, hemodynamic changes, or fluctuations in serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or phenytoin levels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the safety and feasibility of a continuous infusion of high-dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> in patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the promising results </plain></SENT>
