<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While basilar artery diameter after double experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in a series of untreated dogs (n = 34) averaged 65% of baseline diameter, arterial diameter in dogs treated prophylactically (n = 18) with 6 mg/kg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and adjunct low-dose steroid averaged 80% of baseline diameter, for a mean reduction in the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> arterial constriction of 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More important than the average effect, however, is the statistical observation that this mean improvement was obtained primarily by a dramatic reduction in the incidence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the situation most likely to account for morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
