<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of asymmetric dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), have been associated with the course and degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a primate model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors sought to determine if similar changes in CSF ADMA levels are observed in patients with SAH, and whether these changes are associated with NO and NOS metabolite levels in the CSF and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Asymmetric dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels were measured in CSF and serum samples collected during the 21-day period after a single aneurysmal SAH in 18 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were also obtained in a control group consisting of seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I and five patients with spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> without SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm, defined as a greater than 11% reduction in the anterior circulation vessel diameter ratio compared with the ratio calculated from the initial arteriogram, was assessed on cerebral arteriography performed around Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 13 patients with SAH, arteriographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid ADMA levels in patients with SAH were higher than in those in the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CSF ADMA level remained unchanged in the five patients with SAH without vasospasm, but was significantly increased in patients with vasospasm after Day 3 (6.2 +/- 1.7 microM) peaking during Days 7 through 9 (13.3 +/- 6.7 microM; p &lt; 0.001) and then gradually decreasing between Days 12 and 21 (8.8 +/- 3.2 microM; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi> levels in the CSF were lower in patients with vasospasm compared to patients without vasospasm (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid ADMA levels positively correlated with the degree of vasospasm (correlation coefficient [CC] = 0.88, p = 0.0001; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.95) and negatively correlated with CSF <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels (CC = -0.55; p = 0.017; 95% CI -0.81 to -0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that ADMA is involved in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> and its metabolizing enzymes may be a future target for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
