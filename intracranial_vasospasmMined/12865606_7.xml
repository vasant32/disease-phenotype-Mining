<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: We determined independent variables contributing to the development of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 114 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> within 72 h after SAH were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement (14 patients within 30 days and 25 patients more than 30 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess relationships among various variables and shunt placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three variables were found to be independently associated with VPS patients: (1) the rate of SAH clearance; (2) the duration of external cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and (3) presence of neurological deficits 2 weeks after surgery, which indicates brain damage mainly caused by intraoperative manipulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As in previous reports, intraoperative clot removal and duration of external CSF drainage were found to be closely related to the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain damage due to intraoperative manipulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is seemed to be involved in the occurrence of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in this study </plain></SENT>
