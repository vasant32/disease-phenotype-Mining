<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of five reported pedigrees, four presented as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265964" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">mutilating keratoderma</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008064'>ichthyosis</z:hpo> (variant Vohwinkel syndrome), and one as progressive symmetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0432330" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">erythrokeratoderma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a new Japanese pedigree of loricrin keratoderma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 14-year-old male and his 11-year-old female sibling had both been born as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007479'>collodion babies</z:hpo> and were initially diagnosed as having non-bullous <z:hpo ids='HP_0007431'>congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma</z:hpo>, but later developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000982'>palmoplantar keratoderma</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009775'>pseudoainhum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their father was similarly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a G residue insertion at codon 230-231 of the loricrin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibody studies confirmed the presence of mutant loricrin in the retained nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that loricrin gene mutation may present as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007431'>congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma</z:hpo>, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007479'>collodion baby</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
