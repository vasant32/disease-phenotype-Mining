<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, heterozygous loricrin gene mutations have been identified in two dominantly inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin diseases</z:e>, Vohwinkel syndrome with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008064'>ichthyosis</z:hpo> and progressive symmetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0432330" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">erythrokeratoderma</z:e>, collectively termed loricrin keratoderma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We generated stable HaCaT cell lines that express <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) loricrin and a mutant form found in Vohwinkel syndrome with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008064'>ichthyosis</z:hpo>, using an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16688">ecdysone</z:chebi>-inducible promoter system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells expressing the mutant loricrin grew more rapidly than those expressing WT loricrin after induction for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that phospho-Akt occurred in the nucleolus where the mutant loricrin was also located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of activity of Akt kinase was about nine times higher in cells with the mutant than in those with WT loricrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ERK1/2, the epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 and Stat3 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phosphorylated in cells with the mutant loricrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The docking proteins, Gab1 and c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>, were also tyrosine-phosphorylated in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Stat3 protein bound to the VEGF promoter in cells with the mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study suggests that VEGF release and the subsequent activation of VEGF receptor 2 link loricrin gene mutations to rapid cell proliferation in a cellular model of loricrin keratoderma </plain></SENT>
