<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently identified heterozygous loricrin gene mutations in two dominantly inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin diseases</z:e>, the ichthyotic variant of Vohwinkel syndrome and progressive symmetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0432330" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">erythrokeratoderma</z:e>, collectively termed loricrin keratoderma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to see whether the mutant loricrin molecules predicted by DNA sequencing are expressed in vivo and to define their pathologic effects, we raised antibodies against synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> corresponding to the mutated sequences of loricrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting of horny cell extracts from loricrin keratoderma patients showed specific bands for mutant loricrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of loricrin keratoderma skin biopsies showed positive immunoreactivity to the mutant loricrin antibodies in the nuclei of differentiated epidermal keratinocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunostaining was localized to the nucleoli of the lower granular cell layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As keratinocyte differentiation progressed the immunoreactivity moved gradually into the nucleoplasm leaving nucleoli mostly nonimmunoreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No substantial staining was observed along the cornified cell envelope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study confirmed that mutant loricrin was expressed in the loricrin keratoderma skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutant loricrin, as a dominant negative disrupter, is not likely to affect cornified cell envelope crosslinking directly, but seems to interfere with nuclear/nucleolar functions of differentiating keratinocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, detection of the mutant loricrin in scraped horny layer could provide a simple noninvasive screening test for loricrin keratoderma </plain></SENT>
