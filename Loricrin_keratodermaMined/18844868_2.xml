<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Loricrin keratoderma (LK) is a group of congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0002096'>skin abnormalities</z:mp> characterized by the common features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007465'>honeycomb palmoplantar keratoderma</z:hpo> and diffused ichthyosiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies have shown that LK is associated with genetic defects of the loricrin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the correlation between a loricrin mutation and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> phenotype of loricrin keratoderma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained DNA samples from a large family in which affected members showed more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000962'>hyperkeratosis</z:hpo> on the dorsal parts of their hands, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000982'>palmoplantar keratoderma</z:hpo> with no honeycomb-like manifestations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007503'>generalized ichthyosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening of the loricrin gene was performed by direct sequencing of the entire coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasmids encoding the green fluorescent protein-tagged human loricrin were constructed and transferred to 293A cells for subcellular localization analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Molecular analyses of the loricrin gene identified a novel insertion mutation c.545-546insG that resulted in a frameshift after codon 182 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mutation was predicted to produce a mutant protein with a frameshift of its C-terminal sequence of amino acids that embeds a newly generated nuclear localization signal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e>), and to be 22 amino acids longer than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein due to a delayed termination codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NLSs appear to result in an accumulation of mutant loricrin within nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results extend the repertoire of loricrin mutations underlying LK, provide further evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> phenotypes of LK may be the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of loricrin mutations, and demonstrate that nuclear accumulation of mutant loricrin is due to the nuclear targeting sequences in the mutant C-terminus </plain></SENT>
