<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, they were classified by clinical features and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result of the recent molecular biological revolution, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020757" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ichthyoses</z:e> are now recognized as comprising many diverse entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, identical phenotypes may be caused by mutations in multiple genes, while mutations in a single gene may result in multiple and sometimes widely divergent phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The considerable complexity of this clinically and genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of disorders has prompted the need for a new classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A classification that uses terminology based on a combination of the clinical and molecular genetic details, for instance loricrin keratoderma, is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this chapter we will use in principle the nosology adopted recently by an international group of experts at the First <z:hpo ids='HP_0008064'>Ichthyosis</z:hpo> Consensus Conference in Sor√®z, France </plain></SENT>
