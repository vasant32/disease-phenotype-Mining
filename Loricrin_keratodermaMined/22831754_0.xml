<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analyses have helped characterize the underlying genetic defects in an increasing number of hereditary PPKs over the past two decades, and thus a pathophysiological classificaiton seems more reasonable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Today PPK can be classified based on defects in keratins, loricrin, desmosomes, connexins and cathepsins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe a 22-year-old man who had been born a <z:hpo ids='HP_0007479'>collodion baby</z:hpo>, and later developed diffuse PPK with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009775'>pseudoainhum</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007503'>generalized ichthyosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His mother and grandmother had similar characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of genomic DNA identified a frameshift insertion mutation (730insG) in the loricrin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This family had the typical presentation of loricrin keratoderma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0007479'>collodion baby</z:hpo> may be the first presentation in patients with loricrin keratoderma </plain></SENT>
