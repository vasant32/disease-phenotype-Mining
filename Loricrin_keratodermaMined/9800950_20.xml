<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes from the granular to enucleated cornified layer involves drastic changes both in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and biochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Profilaggrin is a keratinocyte-specific phosphoprotein expressed in the granular layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although keratinization has been regarded as a specialized form of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the mechanism for this cellular transition at the molecular level is not yet well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry to investigate the localization of the profilaggrin domains during this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibodies specific for the amino-terminal domains of profilaggrin showed localization in keratohyalin granules in the granular cells, but stained the nucleus in transition cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an antibody to filaggrin domains stained the cytoplasm in the transition cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclei that were positive to amino-terminal profilaggrin contained fragmented DNA, characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the epidermis of patients with progressive symmetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0432330" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">erythrokeratoderma</z:e> carrying a mutation in the loricrin gene (loricrin keratoderma), the profilaggrin amino-terminal domains were packed within apoptotic nuclei together with loricrin aggregates and this persisted up to the parakeratotic superficial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that the amino-terminal profilaggrin domains are cleaved from the filaggrin repeats and transiently localized to the apoptotic nuclei just before the formation of enucleated stratum corneum in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epidermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests a significant role for the profilaggrin amino-terminus in nuclear events associated with keratinocyte terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disrupted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> found in loricrin keratoderma might explain the marked parakeratotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000962'>hyperkeratosis</z:hpo> characteristic of this disease </plain></SENT>
