Amongest nine cases of internal carotid artery thrombosis following blunt trauma, six showed a typical acute contrast termination several cm. beyond the carotid bifurcation. In the other cases, one was taken with an unusual projection, one had a high occlusion beyong the origin of the ophthalmic artery and the third showed a stenosis due to a mural thrombosis. Perforating carotid injuries should be examined angiographically because of the danger of late complications. Two functional occlusions were observed following acute vascular angulation. This type of occlusion is contrasted with the convex vascular margin in the internal carotid artery seen in atherosclerotic, embolic or "spontaneous" carotid occlusion.
