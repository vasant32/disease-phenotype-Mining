To evaluate the perioperative outcomes and the immediate increases in size after patch closure, 140 carotid endarterectomies were randomized into one of three groups: direct no-patch closure, saphenous vein patch closure, and polytetrafluoroethylene patch closure. Seven patients (4.4%) experienced signs of cerebral ischemia in the immediate postoperative period. In three cases this was transient and reversible. In the other four reexploration was undertaken and carotid thrombosis was corrected by thrombectomy. The condition of one of these patients deteriorated to a permanent stroke, whereas the other patients made a complete recovery. Neurologic complications were more frequent in the no-patch group, but the differences between the groups were not significant. The incidence of perioperative internal carotid stenosis, aneurysmal dilatation, and other morphologic abnormalities was assessed in 131 intravenous digital subtraction angiograms taken before the patient was discharged from the hospital. Eight (17.0%) of the endarterectomies in the no-patch group were narrowed by 30% to 50% diameter stenosis, whereas none of the patched arteries had more than 30% stenosis. In contrast, dilatation of the common or internal carotid artery to more than twice the measured diameter was absent in non-patched arteries but was present in seven (17.0%) saphenous patch closures and four (9.23%) polytetrafluoroethylene patch closures. We conclude that patch closure after carotid endarterectomy is less likely to cause stenosis in the perioperative period. Poly-tetrafluoroethylene patches resist dilatation better than do saphenous vein patches and are less likely to become aneurysmal.
