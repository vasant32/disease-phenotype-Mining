The effect of isosorbide dinitrate, a nitrovasodilator known to inhibit platelet function, was examined in a model of electrically induced carotid artery thrombosis in rats. In the dose range of 1-30 mg/kg isosorbide dinitrate, administered orally, significantly delayed carotid occlusion. These results demonstrate that isosorbide dinitrate has antithrombotic activity and it is suggested that this antithrombotic activity is due to the generation of nitric oxide.
