Sixty-seven patients (ages: 11-40 years) suffering from ischemic cerebral circulatory disturbances were investigated clinically and angiographically. In 34 cases, transient ischemic attacks or reversible ischemic neurological defects were diagnosed; 33 patients suffered from completed strokes. In most cases the completed stroke took place without previous transient ischemic attacks. A very good tendency toward recovery was observed in 60 of 67 cases. Stenoses or occlusions were found in only 21.5% of the clinically affected vessel regions. However, 50% of those patients, on whom panangiography was performed, were shown to have stenoses or occlusions. Stenotic vessel wall lesions are also obviously to be expected in clinically nonaffected vessel regions; consequently, in cases of cerebral circulatory disturbances, angiographic investigation of all craniocervical vessels is advisable.
