The effect of Y-20811, a selective thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor, was investigated on cerebral embolism using a new model of embolic cerebral infarction in rabbits. Most of cerebral infarctions were observed in the hemisphere, ipsilateral to the irradiated carotid artery. Cerebral infarction, ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mm in size, appeared only on the surface of the cortex. The platelet emboli were identified in the carotid artery and cortex arteriole by light microscopy. In our study, 83% of the control group had cerebral infarction. Y-20811 significantly suppressed the infarction number and the incidence at doses of 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (p.o.), respectively. Aspirin significantly inhibited the infarction number at a dose of 10 mg/kg, but its inhibitory effect decreased at 30 mg/kg. Ticlopidine showed no effect even at a dose of 300 mg/kg. These results indicate that Y-20811 may be useful in preventing embolic cerebral infarction and transient ischemic attacks.
