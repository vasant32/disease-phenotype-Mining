Is it reasonable and useful to perform surgery on carotid lesions after 75 years? ("old man" according to the W.H.O. classification). To answer this question, we re-examined 66 patients aged 75 to 87 years, who underwent 76 carotid thromboendarteriectomies with one post-operative death. The results study showed that morbidity and general complications were not more important than in younger patients. Late results from 2 to 94 months showed a very low percentage of secondary neurologic complications even if patients had a vascular or general surgical intervention in a second period: 13 cases. There were only 2 re-stenoses. Indications were defined, but it was above all the asymptomatic patients or patients who had a TIA who could benefit from them.
