The present study investigates whether cerebral infarction resulting from internal carotid artery occlusion by cervical dissection is due to emboli, released from a superimposed luminal thrombus, or is due to haemodynamic failure and hypoperfusion. Ten patients with a history of stroke and with a visible cerebral infarct on computed tomographic scan, due to cervical dissection and thrombosis of the internal carotid artery, were studied with positron emission tomography in order to assess the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), the regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) and the regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) in different regions of the brain. rCBF and rCMRO2 were only decreased in the infarct area but not in the peri-infarct zone or elsewhere in the brain. As rOEF was not increased in the affected cerebral hemisphere, the present study suggests artery-to-artery embolism rather than a haemodynamic event as the cause of the stroke. Use of anticoagulants thus appears to be the appropriate treatment in the acute stage.
