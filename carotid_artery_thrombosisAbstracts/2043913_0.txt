This study examined brain-stem auditory evoked potentials response (BAEP) changes in the gerbil after temporary occlusion of the left carotid artery. Fourteen adult gerbils were subjected to unilateral left carotid ligation for 30 min. BAEPs were registered before and 5 min after occlusion, then 5 min, 60 min, 120 min, 24 h, 7 days and 28 days after release of the clip. Waves I (cochlear nerve), III (superior olivary complex) and V (inferior colliculus) were examined. Results were analysed using paired Student's t-test. Transient ischaemia increased latencies of waves I, III and V and the changes were more severe 5 min after release of the clip. In the gerbil, BAEPs might be a suitable method to study cerebral ischaemia.
