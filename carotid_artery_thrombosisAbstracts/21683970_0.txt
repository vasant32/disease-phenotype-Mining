Floating carotid thrombi are a rare cause of stroke mostly associated with atheromatous plaques, cardiogenic emboli, arterial dissections and systemic diseases related to coagulopathic states or iron deficiency anaemia. We report the cases of two patients with stroke and carotid megabulb or suspended bulb associated with floating thrombus. These findings are rarely described probably related to a form of arterial dysplasia and seem to be responsible of local haemodynamic modifications.
