A comparative analysis of results of 70 operations fulfilled by the method of classical with autovein plasty of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and of 103 operations by the method of eversion carotid endarterectomy (CEAE) was made. The time of compression of the carotid artery during the eversion CEAE proved to be considerably less (22.5 +/- 6.5) min, than when using the "classical" method (32.5 +/- 5.3) min. In the nearest postoperative period no neurological complications of embologenic genesis or those associated with acute thrombosis of ICA after the eversion CEAE were noted while after the "classical" method they developed in 3 patients and 2 of them died. After the eversion CEAE 1 patients died of myocardial infarction. In remote periods after the "classical" CEAE the restenosis and reocclusions appeared in 6 patients, while after the eversion method--in 3 patients. CEAE fulfilled by the eversion technique is an effective operation reducing the amount of postoperative neurological complications as well as of late restenosis and reocclusions. It can be used without the applying of the internal bypass.
