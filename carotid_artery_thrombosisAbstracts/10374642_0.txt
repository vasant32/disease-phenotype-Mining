AIM: To study the inhibitory effects of nimodipine (Nim) on rat platelet aggregation and arterial thrombosis in vivo. METHODS: The aggregation rate of platelets induced by ADP and inhibition rate of Nim were measured by the change of light transmission. Effect of Nim on arterial occlusion time was measured by electric stimulation. Effect of Nim on the contents of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 in serum was measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Nim 4.5, 9, 18, and 36 mg.kg-1.d-1 ig for 4 d restrained the platelet aggregation. The IC50 (95% confidence limits) was 26 (9-44) mg.kg-1. Nim 4.5, 9, and 18 mg.kg-1.d-1 ig for 4 d markedly prolonged the time of thrombotic occlusion in carotid artery induced by electric stimulation. Nim 9 and 18 mg.kg-1.d-1 improved the imbalance of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TXB2 in serum after thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Nim was a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, which was partially concerned with the improved balance of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TXB2.
