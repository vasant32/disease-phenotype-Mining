Reconstruction of the carotid artery was performed in 41 patients (between 1967 and 1974). All had had signs of cerebrovascular insufficiency. There was angiographic evidence of obliterating arteriosclerotic lesions in the carotid artery of 32 patients, carotid aneurysm in two, kinking of the internal carotid artery in four, and acute thromboses of the carotid artery in three. Early and late results indicate that best chances of success exist for stage II and III a cases. The high mortality rate in stages III b and IV (five of twelve patients) clearly shows that in these reconstruction of the carotid artery should be embarked on with caution, especially in the early stages.
