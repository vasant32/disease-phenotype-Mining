Following resection of an angiographically demonstrated fibromuscular stenosis of the renal artery--the cause of long-standing arteria hypertension--there occurred a thrombotic occlusion of the fibromuscular-dysplastic internal carotid artery from which the 34-year-old woman died. The treatment of choice of fibromuscular stenosis of the renal artery with renovascular hypertension is resection of the stenosis with revascularisation or nephrectomy. Since fibromuscular dysplasia is a generalised vascular disease in which all arteries of the muscular type may participate, angiography of the extra-renal, in particular cervical, arteries should be performed preoperatively in addition to the renal artery angiograms.
