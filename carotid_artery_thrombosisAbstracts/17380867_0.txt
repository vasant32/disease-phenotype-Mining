20 elderly patients with average age of 64 +/- 0.1, who had had their atherosclerotic ischemic stroke within the period from one month till one year, have taken Simvatin for two months in the dose of 10 mg. per day. Analysis of the central hemodynamics and lipid metabolism before and after the treatment with Simvatin showed that the medication improves central hemodynamics (linear systolic velocity in common carotid and vertebral arteries increases and peripheral resistance in complicated internal carotid artery and two vertebral arteries decreases, dimension of atherosclerosis plaques and intima-media of common carotid artery decrease. Simvatin lowers the content of cholesterin, lipoprotein and fibrinogens. Positive effect of treatment with Simvatin on the cerebral hemodynamics, intensity of atherosclerotic process and lipid methabolism proves the medication to be recommended in treatment of patients with ischemic stroke in anamnesis.
