The assessment is presented of 160 patients with ischaemic stroke from the point of view of gender, selected risk factors, incidence of internal carotid thrombosis (ICT) and age. The material was divided into three age groups: up to 49 years, 50-69 years and 70 years and above. A significant prevalence of men was noted in both younger age groups. With progressing age atrial fibrillation was found significantly more frequently while the number of patients with ICT was decreasing. Similarly, the number of smokers and patients with raised hematocrit value was decreasing. The most frequent risk factor for ischaemic was hypertension. Obesity and diabetes were not significantly changing in relation to age in their prevalence in this material.
