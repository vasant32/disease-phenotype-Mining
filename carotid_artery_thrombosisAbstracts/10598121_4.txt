These studies were designed to examine the pharmacodynamic profile and antithrombotic efficacy of RPR120844, a competitive inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa, with a K(i) of 7 nM against human factor Xa. In vitro, RPR120844 doubled activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at concentrations of 1.54, 1.48, and 0.74 microM in plasma obtained from humans, dogs, and rats, respectively. Intravenous bolus administration of RPR 120844 at 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg to rats resulted in maximal increases in APTT of 1.8-, 2.6-, and 8.4-fold over baseline, respectively. The effect on prothrombin time (PT) was less pronounced, resulting in a 4.4-fold increase at 3 mg/kg. These effects were rapidly reversible; APTT and PT returned to control values by 30 min after dosing. Intragastric administration to rats at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg resulted in modest increases in APTT and PT of 1.5- and 1.3-fold over baseline at the highest dose. Plasma levels were estimated by anti-Xa activity by using an amidolytic, chromogenic assay. Plasma levels were 0.65, 1.29, and 2.45 microM at 30 min after dosing at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Intravenous administration to dogs at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg produced maximal increases in APTT of 1.7- and 2.4-fold over baseline, respectively. Intragastric administration to dogs at 50 mg/kg resulted in maximal increases in APTT and PT of 1.7- and 1.1-fold over baseline, with peak plasma levels of 3.9 microM observed at 15 min after dosing. In a rat model of FeCl2-induced carotid artery thrombosis, RPR120844 (3 mg/kg, i.v. bolus + 300 microg/kg/min constant infusion; n = 4) significantly increased time-to-occlusion from 18+/-1 min (vehicle, n = 4) to 60 min (maximal observation time) and reduced thrombus mass from 5.5 +/- 0.2 mg (vehicle) to 1.4 +/- 0.2 mg. These results indicate that RPR120844 is a potent, selective inhibitor of Xa that exhibits oral activity and is efficacious in a standard model of arterial thrombosis.
