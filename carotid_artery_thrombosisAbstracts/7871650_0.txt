Ophthalmologic examinations were carried out in 92 patients, mean age 55.4 years, with internal carotid artery abnormalities (stenoses and thromboses) confirmed by dopplerography. Various visual disturbances were diagnosed, the most prevalent ocular symptom being transitory homolateral blindness which was detected in 28 (30.4%) patients. Optic disk abnormalities were found in 9 (9.8%) patients, thrombosis (embolism) of the central retinal artery or its branch in 3 (3.3%); 6(6.5%) patients developed monolateral retinopathy which resulted from persistent retinal hypoxemia, and only 1 (1.1%) patient presented with ischemic oculopathy. Later developing neurologic and ophthalmologic complications may be prevented if visual disturbances of this type, particularly transitory ones, are not neglected during diagnosis of carotid diseases.
