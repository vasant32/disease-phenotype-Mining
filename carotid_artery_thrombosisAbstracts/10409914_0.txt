Bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt cervicofacial trauma. The diagnosis of a carotid injury is rarely suspected in trauma patients with neurological deficits. Neurological symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion. Angiography should be considered in trauma patients with hemiplegia and a normal mental status and in patients with blunt cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological examination. Initial heparinisation can prevent arterial thrombosis and neurological deterioration.
