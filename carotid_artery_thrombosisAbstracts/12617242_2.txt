This case report describes a 66-year-old woman who initially presented with features of hypopituitarism secondary to a giant intra-cavernous internal carotid aneurysm. She represented a year later with features suggestive of a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but repeat CT showed no change from the one performed previously. A repeat angiogram, however, showed complete spontaneous thrombosis of the aneurysm including the parent artery.
