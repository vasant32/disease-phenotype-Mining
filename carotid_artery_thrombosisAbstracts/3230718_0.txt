The effects of carotid artery ligation on choroidal blood flow were studied in 30 rabbits using a hydrogen clearance method. The choroidal blood flow (ChBF) decreased significantly to about 75% for 60 minutes after the ipsilateral ligation of the common carotid artery. In 11 of the rabbits ChBF was measured both one and six weeks after ligation. ChBF recovered to 88% of the resting level one week after the ligation, and returned to the resting values six weeks after the ligation. The left carotid artery was ligated six weeks after ligation of the right carotid artery, and there was not any significant change in the ChBF of the right eye. It seemed that the recovery of the ChBF of the right eye was not through the contralateral carotid artery.
