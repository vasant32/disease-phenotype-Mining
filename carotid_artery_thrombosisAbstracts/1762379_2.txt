Distribution and number of ischemic cerebrovascular events were studied in 57 patients who suffered from heart disorders with proven or highly probable source of cardiac embolism and compared to 39 patients with ulcerations of the craniocervical vessels. Patients with coexisting lesions were excluded from the present study. Out of the 57 patients with cardiac disorders, a single episode of cerebral embolism occurred in 33 patients. Of the 24 patients with recurrent ischemic episodes, different vascular territories were involved in only six cases. There was no evidence of a distinct distribution of vascular territories involved in cerebral embolism. The left middle cerebral artery was affected in 42.9%, the right middle cerebral artery in 23.8%, the vertebrobasilar territory in 19%, and the ophthalmic arteries in 14.2%. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in lesion localization between the group with a cardiac source of embolism and the group with ulcerations of the craniocervical vessels. There was a high frequency of patients with recurrent cardiogenic emboli in the ophthalmic (6 of 9 patients) as well as in the vertebrobasilar (6 of 12 patients) circulation who experienced a delayed initiation of cardiac assessment. The possibility of cardiac embolism should be considered in any patient with cerebral ischemia, independently of the vascular territory affected.
