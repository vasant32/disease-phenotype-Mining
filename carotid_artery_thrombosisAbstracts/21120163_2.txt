 BACKGROUND: Fucoidan is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, which has a molecular structure similar to that of heparin. The antithrombotic effects of fucoidan in vitro have been widely reported, but its antithrombotic effects in vivo as well as its other biological properties in vitro have not been well investigated. METHODS: This study investigated the effects and mechanism of fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus on thrombosis both in vitro and in vivo. A ferric chloride-induced mouse carotid artery thrombosis model was used to determine the antithrombotic effects of fucoidan in vivo. Additionally, changes in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were examined in vascular cells treated with fucoidan. RESULTS: In vivo studies employing a ferric chloride-induced mouse carotid artery thrombosis model indicated that fucoidan had a stronger antithrombotic activity than heparin. Further, vascular cells treated with fucoidan demonstrated a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production as well as inhibition of proliferation. CONCLUSION: The major findings of this study showed that fucoidan has a stronger antithrombotic effect than heparin in vivo and that fucoidan has an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine production and proliferation of vascular cells.
