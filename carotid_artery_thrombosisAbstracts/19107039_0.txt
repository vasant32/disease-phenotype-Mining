We report the case of a 59-year-old female presenting an ocular ischemic syndrome caused by occlusion of the internal carotid artery. MRI showed multiple previous episodes of stroke. Therapy consisted in stopping the antihypertensive medication in order to stabilize the residual cerebral perfusion pressure and initiating statin and antiaggregant therapy.
