Twenty-six patients under 20 years of age having cerebrovascular disease were studied from 1968 to 1972. Common risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and heart disease were not present. Angiographical study showed a variety of abnormalities. No consistent defect was present. There was a high incidence of pyrexia and convulsions in the early stages of stroke and it appears possible that some form of arteritis might have been important in the production of the cerebral infarction.
