OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of total flavone of Abelmoschl Manihot L. Medic (TFA) on the function of platelets and to explore its mechanism. METHODS: Rat models of artery-veins bypassing thrombus formation were used. The platelets of rabbits were collected. Platelet aggregation was induced by collagen and intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was assayed by Fura-2 method. RESULTS: TFA (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently reduced the weight of thrombus. TFA (0.025, 0.05, 0.1 mg/ml) possessed dose-dependant inhibitory effects on rabbits' platelet aggregation induced by collagen. TFA significantly reduced the resting and CaCl(2)-induced increase of free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in rabbit platelet in vitro. CONCLUSION: TFA has an antiplatelet effect via the inhibition on the influx of Ca(2+).
