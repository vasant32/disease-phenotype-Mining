A 71-year-old male presented with severe left cervical internal carotid artery stenosis manifesting as repeated transient ischemic attacks consisting of right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) under distal protection was performed to prevent further ischemic events. This procedure was uneventful. However, the patient exhibited progressive right hemiparesis and motor aphasia 3 days after CAS. Emergent angiography revealed carotid artery occlusion due to in-stent thrombosis. In-stent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed under distal protection. The carotid artery was recanalized with small residual thrombus. The neurological deficits almost completely disappeared after PTA. Follow-up angiography 9 months after stenting showed restenosis but no in-stent thrombosis. Carotid thrombosis after CAS can be resolved by in-stent PTA under distal protection and subsequent treatment with antithrombotic agents.
