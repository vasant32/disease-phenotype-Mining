We report on our experience with the intra-arterial administration of eptifibatide for thrombolysis during aneurysm-embolization procedures. In 4 cases (3 stent-assisted coiling procedures and 1 with posthemorrhagic vasospasm), we noted the formation of thrombus occluding a vessel. We administered eptifibatide (10-15 mg) through a microcatheter proximal to the thrombus. The thrombus rapidly dissolved, resulting in the recanalization of the occluded vessels with no rethrombosis or hemorrhagic complications.
