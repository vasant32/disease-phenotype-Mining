AIM: A fibrinolytic enzyme from Agkistrodon acutus venom, called FIIa, was tested for thrombolytic activity in animals. METHODS: Carotid thrombosis model in rats and rabbits and middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombosis model in rats were used. RESULTS: Intravenous administration of FIIa, at a dosage of 0.625 mg/kg, resulted in thrombolysis of carotid thrombi. However, in middle cerebral artery thrombosis, the effective thrombolysis dose was 1.25 mg/kg. When the dosage of FIIa increased, the thrombolytic effect was stronger. Histological examination of kidney, liver, heart, and lung tissue showed no hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: It shows that FIIa from Agkistrodon acutus venom is able to solubilize thrombus in vivo without hemorrhage at an effective dose for thrombolysis.
