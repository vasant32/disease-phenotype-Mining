Unilateral limb shaking has been described as brief, repetitive jerking movements of arm and leg, resembling seizures and attributed to transient cerebral ischemia. We report a patient with numerous episodes of whole body shaking in the setting of bilateral carotid occlusions as well as vertebral stenoocclusive disease. These episodes of whole body shaking occurred in the presence of bilateral intracranial blood flow steal phenomenon. After angioplasty of the vertebral artery and initiation of aggressive medical therapy and non-invasive ventilatory correction, intracranial blood flow improved and whole body shaking episodes were resolved during 6-months follow-up.
