We describe the case of a 62 years old woman with several transient isquemic attacks. The neuroradiological study demonstrated occlusion of the common carotid artery with revascularization of the internal carotid artery by anastomosis with the inferior thyroid artery and an aneurysm of internal carotid artery at the emergency of the anterior choroidal artery. The patient was treated with a bypass between the subclavian artery and the internal carotid artery with complete regression of the symptoms.
