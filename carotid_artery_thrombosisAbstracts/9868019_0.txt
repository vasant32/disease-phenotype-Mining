The therapeutic effect of Ganoderma japonicum(Fr.) Lloyd mixture on thrombosis and its mechanism were studied. The results showed that Ganoderma japonicum(Fr.) Lloyd mixture inhibited thrombus formation in vitro and in vivo, the thrombus weight and length formed in the rabbit common carotid artery and external jugular vein were significantly decreased in the experimental group compared with the control (P < 0.01). The results suggest that Ganoderma japonicum(Fr.) Lloyed mixture has anti-thrombotic effect, blood coagulation and platelet activation were inhibited, and the ability of vascular endothelial cells against the process of thrombosis was enhanced.
