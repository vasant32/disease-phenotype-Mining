Recent studies have shown that (1) monthly neutron activity (NA) (imp/min) correlates with monthly number of acute myocardial infarction (AMI); (2) NA is higher on days of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (AICD) discharges for VT, VF. Here we checked the level of NA in relation to timing and type of sudden cardiac death (SCD) patients [n=848 (579, 68.28% male)] obtained from the Kaunas registry for the years 2002-2004. All underwent Forensic Medicine post mortem examination and classification according to ICD10 by code 121-125. Daily NA data were obtained from Oulu U-ty, Finland and Moscow Monitoring Station of the Russian Academy of Sciences. No difference in NA was found on days with or without SCD. In men < 65, SCD occurred on days with higher NA than in women of the same age (p = 0.01) or in > 65 y old men (p = 0.045). Days of SCD with myocardial ruptures showed the highest level of NA, significantly higher than on all days (n = 669) of SCD (p = 0.037) and all 1096 days of the study (p = 0.0048). Three groups were accompanied by significantly higher NA: repeated AMI, myocardial ruptures (codes122, 123), and coronary atherothrombosis without AMI, related to electrical heart instability. The mechanism of possible neutron role in pathophysiology needs special studies.
