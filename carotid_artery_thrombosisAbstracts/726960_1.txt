A case of bilateral internal carotid artery thrombosis after blunt injury to the head in a 54 years old male is described. The literature is reviewed and comment is made on the causes. Unilateral thrombosis of the internal carotid artery after closed or blunt injury to the head and neck is well known but not common. There is only one previously recorded case of bilateral internal carotid artery thrombosis after such an injury (Yashon et al. 1964).
