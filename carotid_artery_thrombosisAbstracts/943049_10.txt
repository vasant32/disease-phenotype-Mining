During a 36-month period, seven cases of Horner's syndrome were encountered in a general pediatric hospital. The most common site of involvement was the ipsilateral sympathetic chain, although multiple sites were involved. Several causes of Horner's syndrome in childhood that have received little previous attention are reported-internal carotid artery thrombosis, subclavian artery aneurysm, and nasopharyngeal tumor. Suggestions for routine evaluation are given. Angiography and x-rays of the temporal and sphenoid bones are valuable in the diagnosis of intracranial lesions causing Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome is not rare in childhood and is associated with serious underlying disease.
