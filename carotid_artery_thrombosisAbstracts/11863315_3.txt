The use of oral contraceptives is a potential cause of ischemic stroke in young women. The risk of stroke is higher when contraceptives contain high levels of estrogens. A thrombotic occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, seen on ultrasound, developed in a patient who was taking high-dose estrogen contraception. Recanalization occurred several months later by spontaneous thrombolysis and was confirmed by cerebral angiography. This case suggests that the activation of endothelial spontaneous antithrombotic mechanisms may allow the dissolution of a thrombus, once the cause of the thrombosis has been identified and removed and when the endothelium has maintained its functional integrity.
