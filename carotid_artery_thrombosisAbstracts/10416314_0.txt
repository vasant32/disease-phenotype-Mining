BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is often carried out to prevent cerebrovascular strokes. It is obviously important that neurological morbidity of the procedure is contained within acceptable limits (< 2%). METHODS: Between January 1991 and December 1997 a total of 239 CEA were performed in 216 patients (169 males and 47 females, mean age 66.6 +/- 14.2 years; range 43-81). Angioplasty was carried out using a precoagulated Dacron patch, except in cases in which the residual diameter of the internal carotid artery was greater than 5 mm. A Javid shunt was used selectively if stump pressure < 50 mmHg. RESULTS: No major neurological complications were observed. A reversible focal neurological deficit was reported in 3 cases (1.2%). Neurological morbidity correlated to peripheral arterial occlusive disease appears to be correlated mainly with technical reasons or cerebral ischemia following clamping. CONCLUSIONS: The extensive use of angioplasty with patch and the selective use of a protective shunt improve the technical success rate of surgery, significantly helping to limit morbidity.
