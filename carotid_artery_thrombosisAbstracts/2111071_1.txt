Mucormycosis is a very serious fungal infection caused by habitual saprophytes of the human organism, in many cases concomitant with various pathological conditions marked by immunodepression. The rhinocerebral variant habitually accompanies ketoacidotic diabetes. We report a case of rhinocerebral mucormycosis in a subject free from immunodepression and non-diabetic, in apparently normal health. Following treatment with amphotericin B combined with 5-fluorocytosine and surgery, remission of the disease was finally secured and about one year after the last operation there are no sign of resumption.
