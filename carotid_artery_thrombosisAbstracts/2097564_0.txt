There is no consensus of opinion regarding the type of suture to be used followed carotid TEA. The paper reports a study carried out in 123 operated patients who were followed for a variable period ranging from 6 months to 4 years with six-monthly controls using B-mode echotomography, supplemented by digital angiography via a venous route if necessary. A direct suture was used in 92 of the patients, while a venous patch was applied in the remaining 31. Subsequent controls revealed a relative frequency of restenosis of a fundamentally benign nature at a point which was proximal or distal to TEA. In addition, the study showed that continuous suture may be valid in male patients but doubts continue to exist regarding its use in female patients. In the latter, it is therefore preferable to encourage a more widespread use of the venous patch.
