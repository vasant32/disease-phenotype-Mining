In vivo markers that allow for detection of ferritin within atheromatous plaque may be useful for identifying iron-catalyzed hydroxyl-radical formation and subsequent lipid peroxidation. Recently, a positive contrast MR technique--GRadient echo Acquisition for Superparamagnetic particles/suscePtibility (GRASP)--was used to identify the presence of magnetic entities in phantom models. The aim of the current study was to determine the feasibility of using GRASP in conjunction with conventional T(2) (*)-weighted (T(2) (*)W) gradient-echo (GRE) sequences for identifying ferritin/hemosiderin deposition using in vitro and in vivo models of thrombus. In vitro thrombi were prepared by incubating blood with ferritin. MRI was performed using conventional GRE sequences and GRASP. The results indicate that GRASP was able to verify ferritin deposition in in vitro thrombi. In vivo thrombi were created using a crush injury model in rabbits. The signal enhancement obtained using conventional GRE sequences and GRASP was compared with the location of iron deposition by histology. In all of the animals the GRASP signal correlated with signal loss by conventional GRE, and ferritin/hemosiderin deposition by histology. GRASP sequences in combination with conventional GRE sequences may be used to detect the presence of ferritin deposition in in vitro thrombi and in vivo crush-injured rabbit carotid arteries.
