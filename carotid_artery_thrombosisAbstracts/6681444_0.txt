The Authors present a case of bilateral internal carotid artery thrombosis (BICAT) with a minimal symptomatology and whose neurological examination was consistently negative. The angiographic investigation revealed that the major supratentorial vessels were bilaterally filled via the vertebro-basilar system. Although it is now generally accepted that there are occasional cases where bilateral occlusion may be compatible with adequate vital functions, the Authors think that it is extremely rare to find a case as neurologically intact as theirs.
