From 1964 through 1991 we performed primary closure of the arteriotomy in 1173 patients and patch angioplasty in 506 patients after carotid endarterectomy. The decision to patch was made at the surgeon's discretion. In general a patch was used for small arteries. In the primary closure group 32 patients (2.7%) had a perioperative stroke and in the patch angioplasty group 17 (3.4%) had a stroke. The difference (2.7% vs. 3.4%) was not significant (p < 0.5275, Fisher's exact two-tailed test). A total of 240 arteries were closed with a vein patch and 11 (4.6%) of these patients had a stroke; 266 were closed with a synthetic patch (Dacron, 211; polytetrafluoroethylene, 55) and six of the patients had a stroke (2.3%). The difference in stroke rate between the vein and synthetic patch groups (4.6% vs. 2.3%) was not significant (p < 0.2159). Patch angioplasty cannot be shown to reduce the incidence of perioperative stroke. Late carotid patency was not studied. This study supports a policy of selective patch angioplasty based on arterial size rather than patching all carotid arteries. When a patch is used, we prefer filamentous Dacron as the patch material.
