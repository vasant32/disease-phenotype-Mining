Successful percutaneous transluminal dilatation of an anonyma stenosis is reported. The patient was a 40 year-old male with the aortic arch syndrome. Five years before an occlusion of the central carotid artery, as well as anonyma and left subclavian stenoses were treated by means of vascular grafts. On recurrence of the neurological symptoms, reocclusion of the right graft to the anonyma artery and subtotal stenosis of the left carotid bifurcation was noted. The anonyma stenosis was dilated by means of PTD. Haemodynamic success was demonstrated by Doppler sonography.
