A case of carotid-cavernous fistula is described associated with extradural haematoma, temporal lobe contusion, ophthalmoplegia, optic nerve injury by fracture, rhinorrhoea, orbital encephalocoele, and traumatic carotid thrombosis. The fistula was occluded by clipping of the carotid artery intracranially and also of the ophthalmic artery.
