This study was purposed to explore the effect of troxerotin and cerebroproptein hydrolysate injection (TCHI) on platelet aggregation in vitro and thrombosis in vivo. The inhibitory rate of TCHI at different concentrations on platelet aggregation was determined by platelet aggregometer. The relationship between dose and effect was established. The effect of troxerutin and cerebroproptein hydrolysate injection on thrombosis was determined by the carotid thrombosis model of rats. The results showed that the TCHI could inhibit thrombosis and platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent way. When the concentration of TCHI total nitrogen was 5 µg/ml, the inhibition rate of platelet aggregation reached to the highest value of 28.61 ± 22.07%, which is 2.5 times as much as that with 100 µg/ml aspirin. It is concluded that the TCHI has antiaggregative and antithrombotic activity effects against platelet aggregation and thrombosis.
