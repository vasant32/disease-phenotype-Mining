A case of false aneurysm of the common carotid artery after blunt trauma is described. We found seven other such cases in the literature. The literature is reviewed and it is concluded that this rare injury should be operated on as soon as the diagnosis has been made. Lateral excision and arteriorrhaphy, or aneurysm resection in larger lesions, are recommended.
