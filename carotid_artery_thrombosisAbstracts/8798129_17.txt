PURPOSE: To report the results of balloon angioplasty in recurrent carotid occlusive disease and evaluate the potential for stent implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between April 1991 and September 1995, 15 patients with carotid restenosis underwent 17 endoluminal procedures in 3 common carotid and 14 internal carotid arteries. Two postdilation complications (dissection and acute occlusion) required prompt stenting; one common carotid artery was stented for postdilation residual stenosis. One recurrent lesion was also stented 6 months after initial angioplasty. One stroke, 1 silent cerebral infarction, and 3 transient ischemic attacks occurred in the balloon angioplasty patients (33% neurological complication rate). The common carotid stent patient died 3 days postoperatively due to hyperperfusion syndrome. Long-term follow-up in two stent patients showed no restenosis at 18 and 48 months, respectively. The 11 balloon angioplasty patients likewise have not demonstrated restenosis. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon angioplasty alone appears too risky for treating recurrent carotid disease. Stents may offer a safer alternative, particularly when implanted primarily.
