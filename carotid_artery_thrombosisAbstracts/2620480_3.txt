A 60-year-old man with massive subarachnoid hemorrhage is reported. Radiologically, bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid arteries and multiple cerebral aneurysms of the saccular type were detected. Postmortem examination revealed that the internal carotid arteries were markedly diminutive and completely occluded by mesenchymal fibrous tissue. The pathogenesis of the diminutive internal carotid arteries and the cerebral aneurysms were briefly discussed.
