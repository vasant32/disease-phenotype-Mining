BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of a direct factor (F)Xa inhibitor, ZK-807834, was compared with indirect inhibition by enoxaparin for inhibition and deaggregation of acute platelet-rich thrombi in a well-characterized porcine carotid injury model. METHODS: A crush injury was performed on a randomly chosen carotid artery and the thrombus allowed to propagate for 30 min. Pigs then received intravenous drug for 35 min: ZK-807834-Dose 1 (40 microg kg(-1) bolus + 1.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) infusion, n=6); ZK-807834-Dose 2 (20 microg kg(-1) bolus + 0.75 microg kg(-1) min(-1) infusion; n=6); enoxaparin (1 mg kg(-1) bolus; n=6); or saline (n=6). Five minutes after drug initiation, the contralateral artery was injured. Thrombus size was monitored by scintillation detection of autologous 111In-platelets. RESULTS: The prothrombin time ratio was 2.2 +/- 0.1; 1.4 +/- 0.3; 1.2 +/- 0.9 and 1.1 +/- 0.2, respectively. ZK-807834-Dose 1 significantly inhibited carotid platelet deposition (525 +/- 226 x 10(6) cm(-2); P = 0.008), whereas ZK-807834-Dose 2 (2325 +/- 768) and enoxaparin (1236 +/- 383) were not different from saline (2776 +/- 642). Thrombus deaggregation was greatest for animals receiving ZK-807834-Dose 1 (473 +/- 185). Neither ZK-807834-Dose 2 (1588 +/- 480) nor enoxaparin (1618 +/- 686) was different from saline control (2222 +/- 598). CONCLUSIONS: Direct FXa inhibition with ZK-807834, at a prothrombin time ratio of 2.2, effectively inhibits thrombosis and promptly deaggregates thrombi induced by arterial injury. In contrast, indirect FXa inhibition with enoxaparin was ineffective.
