Removal of thrombus from a totally occluded internal carotid artery with a patent siphon by means of a balloon-tipped Fogarty catheter has been an acceptable technique. There have, however, been five reported cases of carotid-cavernous fistula following this procedure (Barker et al., 1968; Davie and Richardson, 1967; Motarjeme and Keifer, 1973; Newton and Potts, 1974). The purpose of this report is to add a sixth case to the literature and to suggest that this surgical method be abandoned.
