Three cases of traumatic thrombosis of the internal carotid artery due to head injury with basal skull fracture were reported. The mechanism of thrombosis, the symptomatologic characteristics and the prognosis were discussed with reference to the data in the literature. Four mechanisms by which the condition may be produced include; injury to the intrapetrous or cevernous portion of the carotid artery during basal skull fracture, injury to the point of emergence of the carotid artery from the cavernous sinus as a result of shearing strains suffered at the time of injury, a direct blow to the neck or trauma to the paratonsillar area by a foreign object carried in the mouth, and stretching of the carotid artery by heperextension and lateral flexion of the neck. Secondary symptoms due to thrombosis of the carotid artery after an interval develop most commonly from twelve to twenty four hours. The prognosis in these patients is mostly poor. Therefore, angiography should be performed immediately on any patient suspected of having this lesion and treatment should be considered.
