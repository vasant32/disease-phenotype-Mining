Intracranial dissection of the internal carotid artery after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a serious complication with a potentially fatal outcome. We report on a 67 male with a symptomatic high grad stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Intraoperative completion angiography showed a thrombotic occlusion and the internal carotid artery (ICA) was resected with interposition of a Dacron graft. Completion angiography then revealed a dissection of the petreous ICA, which was corrected by insertion of a coronary artery stent.Stenting of the ICA is a useful tool to restore cerebral perfusion without time delay and completion imaging is extremely helpful for early detection of dissection during CEA.
