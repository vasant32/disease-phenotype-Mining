We present a case of a male patient who was admitted to the cardiology department with a diagnosis of NSTEMI (deep negative T waves in all precordial leads). Two weeks earlier he was hospitalised because of a stroke caused by thrombosis of the left carotid artery. He had no angina. An ECHO showed a normal myocardial contractility of the left ventricle. The concentration of troponin I was also normal. No coronary artery stenosis was revealed in coronary angiography. We present a review of studies devoted to ECG changes in patients with stroke.
