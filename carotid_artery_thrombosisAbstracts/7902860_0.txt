Over a 5 year period (1988-1992), 6 patients were treated by combined carotid and subclavian artery surgery, representing 0.7% of carotid interventions practised during this period. The carotid lesion clinical stage was 0 (2 cases), 1 (2 cases) and 3 (2 cases). While for the subclavian artery 4 patients were asymptomatic and 2 had vertebrobasilar syndromes, one associated with ischemia of upper limb. Only one patient was globally asymptomatic but the diagnosis was a prethrombotic carotid restenosis. Radiographs showed that the atheromatous lesion of the cervical trunks was equivalent to 2.83 stenoses per patient. The decision to use the combined interventions was based on either the clinical condition (combined carotid and vertebrobasilar symptomatology) or hemodynamic data (improvement in subclavian flow during carotid surgery). This hemodynamic component could be determined by transcranial Doppler. Operation consisted always of initial subclavian revascularization (1 reimplantation, 5 bypasses), followed by carotid surgery (2 grafts, 4 endarterectomies). The postoperative course was uneventful in 5 patients, the 6th patient requiring recovery surgery for early carotid thrombosis without worsening of the neurologic state. Mean follow up was 9 months (range 1 to 27 months). Combining these two interventions in this small series did not appear to increase carotid surgery complication. Initial revascularization of the subclavian artery in the patient with multiple trunk lesions corrected the posterior hemodynamic supply to the circle of Willis.
