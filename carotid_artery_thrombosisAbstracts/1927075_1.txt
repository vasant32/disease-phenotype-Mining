The experience with the use of monofilament absorbable suture (5/0 USP) in supraaortal vessels shows the same results related to neurological complication. The postoperative technical complications (bleeding, occlusion, restenosis) could be significantly reduced (p less than or equal to 0.05). Suture ruptures of aneurysms were not observed after resorbable vascular suture. The resorbable monofilament suture material is useful in high pressure vessel system.
