The authors report a patient with an aneurysm of the right cerebral posterior communicating artery (PCoA) developing after thrombotic pseudo-occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA). The aneurysm regressed spontaneously subsequent to ipsilateral ICA endarterectomy and reversal of blood flow in the PCoA. The formation and regression of the aneurysm was well documented by repeat cerebral digital subtraction angiography studies, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The authors conclude that the formation and regression of this 'flow-related' aneurysm was associated with hemodynamic changes in blood flow of the right PCoA and the right ICA.
