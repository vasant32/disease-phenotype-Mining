In this study, 40 patients who underwent surgery for cerebro-vascular insufficiency were considered. Carotid endarterectomy was the procedure of choice in all of the patients; the arteriotomy was always closed using a PUR patch, a new material that, for its chemical and physical characteristics seems to be a good alternative to PTFE. All of the patients underwent surgery under loco-regional anesthesia, allowing a perioperative monitoring of the neurological status through the patient's active collaboration. During the postoperative period, non local or systemic pathology related to the use of the patch has been observed. During the short and half term follow-up, the patients underwent echo-Doppler of the supra-aortic trunks that didn't show either false aneurysms or thrombosis on the patch surface.
