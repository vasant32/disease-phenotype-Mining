A case of lingual necrosis in a patient irradiated 3 years earlier for a tonsillar tumor is presented. Imputability to a post-radiology bilateral external carotid thrombosis is evoked, where the diagnosis of tumoral recurrence and Horton's disease have been ruled out. Cervical peridural nerve block allowed successful treatment of this lesion.
