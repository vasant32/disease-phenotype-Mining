The clinical test was carried out in extracranial carotid occlusions and acute peripheral paralysis with sympathetic lesions. The measurements obtained were compared with those of the infrared thermovision. Both in the technical and in the clinical tests, the device proved to be very suitable. The practical procedure of temperature measurement (cerebral ischemia and lesions of the sympathetic trunk) is described.
