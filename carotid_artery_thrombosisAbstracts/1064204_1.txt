Because extracranial atheromatous disease of the carotid arterial system is a common cause of 'stroke', ophthalmologists may be the first to see patients at risk who present with early signs of this condition. I. The history of previous observations of these signs and the anatomy and physiology of the structures involved are described. The physical and subjective signs and the significance of transient ischaemic attacks are discussed. Methods of diagnosis are reviewed with special reference to ophthalmodynamometry. II. A series of patients personally investigated and treated is analysed: (1)Endarterectomy was performed in seventy cases of internal carotid artery stenosis during a 15-year period (1959-73). (2) 36 cases from the years 1970-73 were studied in detail. (3) 50 per cent. of these presented with ocular symptoms, which were the only complaint in 22 per cent. (4) 95 per cent. of all patients with ocular symptoms experienced recurrent transient visual loss. (5) 61 per cent. of all patients with ocular symptoms showed significant fundus changes. (6) ODM enabled the haemodynamics of the carotid arterial systems to be evaluated in 79 per cent. of the patients studied. (7) The results of surgery suggest that patients who present with ocular symptoms have a better prognosis than those who present with neurological symptoms only.
