A young man with cerebral infarction and circulating lupus anticoagulants was found to have a partially occluding intraluminal thrombosis in the left internal carotid artery. Immediate thrombectomy and medical therapy was followed by gradual partial clinical improvement. Pathologic examination revealed an organized thrombus with diffuse hypersensitivity vasculitis of the small arteries in a skin and muscle biopsy specimen. Increased physician awareness may lead to more prompt diagnosis and treatment of this unusual clinical syndrome.
