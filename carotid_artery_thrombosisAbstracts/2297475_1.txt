Two types of microporous polyurethanes have been evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro polyurethane disks have been seeded by endothelial cells from bovine aortic origin and from fresh human greater omentum. Various pretreatments permit comparison of six different experimental groups. The benefit of poly L lysine, laminin, fibronectin and previous astrocyte cell seeding is shown. The cell proliferation was assessed daily, using trypan blue in Malassez cells. Cell identification was performed by class I MHC antigen characterization and factor VIII staining. In vivo, 4 mm polyurethane arterial prostheses were implanted as carotid interpositions. Evaluation of polyurethane, both in vitro and in vivo, failed to demonstrate a satisfactory hemocompatibility of the material. However, previous treatment of polyurethane with laminin, fibronectin, and astrocyte cell seeding improves the biologic characteristics of the raw material.
