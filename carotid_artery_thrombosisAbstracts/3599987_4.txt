Variations in plaque composition, particularly an increased lipid concentration, could make carotid plaques unstable and prone to embolization. To investigate this hypothesis, 35 carotid bifurcation plaques from 31 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (20 symptomatic, 11 asymptomatic) were prospectively analyzed. Plaque total lipid, cholesterol, collagen, and Ca2+ content were determined, and the plaque collagen was fractionated into pepsin-soluble collagen (PSC) (indicative of less crosslinked, more recently synthesized collagen) and pepsin-insoluble collagen. Preoperative serum lipid and plasma lipoprotein levels were also obtained in all patients. Results revealed that plaques removed from symptomatic patients contained significantly more total lipid and cholesterol (P less than 0.001) than those removed from asymptomatic patients. There was also an increased amount of pepsin-soluble collagen in symptomatic plaques, potentially indicating increased metabolic activity (P less than 0.05). In addition, mean plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher in symptomatic patients than in asymptomatic patients (P less than 0.05). Since lipid-laden plaques can potentially be identified by B-mode ultrasound, it may be important to remove these plaques in asymptomatic patients or, alternatively, to attempt to lower the plaque cholesterol by lipid-lowering maneuvers.
