Necrosis of the tongue is an atypic process, because it has a high irrigation that depends of the right and left lingual arteries. But, there isn't a good anastomosis between both arteries except in the tip and the tongue base. We focus on an exceptional case report about a patient that presented a great necrotic lesion in the middle of the tongue due to a bilateral external carotid thrombosis, because of a radiation therapy some years before.
