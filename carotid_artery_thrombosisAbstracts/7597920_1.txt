AIM: To study the effect of 3,4',5-trihydroxystibene-3-beta-mono-D-glucoside (Polydatin, Pol) on rabbit arterial thrombosis. METHODS: Rabbit arterial thrombosis was induced by vascular endothelial damage with trypsin. RESULTS: It was showed that the moist weights of the thrombus were 6.6 +/- 1.8 and 4.8 +/- 1.6 mg in Pol 5 and 10 mg.kg-1 groups, respectively, which was lighter than that in control (10.9 +/- 1.9 mg, P < 0.05, P < 0.01); the platelet aggregation was inhibited simultaneously. In vitro, Pol 0.30-1.15 mmol.L-1 reduced TXA2 produced in platelets. It did not affect the production of PGI2 in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Thrombosis was abated by Pol. The selective inhibition of production of TXA2 rather than PGI2, is one of the mechanisms involved.
