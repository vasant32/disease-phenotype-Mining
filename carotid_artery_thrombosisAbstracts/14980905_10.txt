Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) have been developed primarily for their oxygenating function and possible use as an alternative to red blood cells during surgery or after major trauma. However, their effect on hemostasis has not been studied extensively. We compared the effects on hemostasis of bovine-derived hemoglobin solution (HBOC-201) with gelatin solution and saline infusion in an experimental model of arterial thrombosis and bleeding. After anesthesia, the Folts model was constructed in 30 rabbits. The common carotid artery was exposed, and a 60% stenosis was induced. A compression injury of the artery was then produced, which triggered a series of cyclic episodes of thrombosis (cyclic flow reductions [CFRs]). After the number of baseline CFRs was counted, animals were assigned randomly to one of three groups (n = 10 each): saline (control), gelatin, or HBOC-201 solution. The effect of studied solutions was observed by recording the number of CFRs during another period and was compared with that of saline. Ear immersion bleeding time was recorded after each CFR period. Gelatin and HBOC-201 had similar effects, manifested by significantly decreased CFRs (from median of 7 to 1 and 6 to 1, respectively) and significantly lengthened bleeding time (from 88 to 98 s and 81 to 102 s, respectively; P < 0.05). Saline infusion had no significant effect on CFRs or bleeding time. HBOC-201 and gelatin had similar effects marked by a reduction in the arterial thrombosis rate and increased bleeding time in rabbits. IMPLICATIONS: In a rabbit thrombosis and hemorrhagic model, a polymerized bovine-derived hemoglobin solution and a gelatin solution infusion decreased arterial thrombosis and lengthened bleeding time.
