A large asymptomatic aneurysm of the internal carotid artery containing a free floating thrombus was detected in a 90-year-old woman. The alteration was documented by duplex sonography of the extracranial carotid arteries. At a second examination 4 days later the thrombus was observed to be fixed to the dorsal and distal aneurysm wall. With regard to the age and reduced general state of health of the patient, invasive diagnostic examinations and reconstructive surgery were not indicated and the patient was released in a good condition.
