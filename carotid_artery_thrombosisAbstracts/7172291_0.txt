Necrosis of adenohypophysis can be quite often detected by systematic histology in some violent and non-violent deaths at the departments of forensic medicine. Necrosis of adenohypophysis occurs with craniocerebral injuries either as a result of contusion, especially with sella fractures, or by a vascular impairment of adenohypophysis due to compression of pituitary stalk. The compression will be caused by increased intracranial pressure, the most often due to brain edema or leptomeningeal haemorrhage. Five cases of this sort are presented. Other cases of adenohypophyseal necrosis were found among decreased from developed shock, heart syncope lasting several minutes, 8-day survival after CO and Theadryl intoxication, bilateral internal carotid thrombosis and permanent controlled ventilation. There was not any clinical diagnosis of adenohypophyseal necrosis in spite of its extend or longer survival.
