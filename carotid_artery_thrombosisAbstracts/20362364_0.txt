Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic vasculitis. Its etiopathogeny remains unknown. Vascular involvement in BD is frequent and venous thrombosis is the most common manifestation (30% of cases). Arterial involvement is rare (2.7 to 7%). The latter is often severe and considered as a life threatening complication. Pathogenesis of thrombosis occurring in BD remains unclear. We report a 45-year-old man, from south of Tunisia, who presented a BD with a bifocal arterial involvement: right internal carotid thrombosis and bilateral proximal thrombosis of the two pulmonary arteries. Therapeutic strategies to address this multiple arterial involvement and the pathogenesis of thrombosis raise many questions.
