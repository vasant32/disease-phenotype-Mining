A case is presented of cerebral infarction secondary to carotid artery thrombosis in a patient with hemolysis, elevated liver function, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. The patient's rebound thrombocytosis may have contributed to a hypercoagulable state. Severe preeclamptic patients with HELLP syndrome who experience a reactive thrombocytosis may represent a subset of women who have postpartum thrombosis.
