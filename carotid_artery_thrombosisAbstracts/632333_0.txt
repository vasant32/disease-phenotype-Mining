103 venous shunts were performed between the common carotid and the internal carotid arteries. Apart from the usual indications analogous to those of arterial disease in other sites (aneurysms, dissecting aneurysms, trauma), insufficient blood supply to the brain justified 92 grafts out of 496 reconstructive operations carried out between 1960 to 1976: atheromatous stenosis with subjacent loop, diffuse stenosing lesions of the common carotid or rising high up on the internal carotid, acute thrombosis and reoperations are the main indications. There was only one complication of the method, a venous graft of small calibre required replacement by a dacron prosthesis.
