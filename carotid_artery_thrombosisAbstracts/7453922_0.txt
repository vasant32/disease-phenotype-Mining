The aim of this work was evaluation of the usefulness of the Doppler ultrasound method for detection of blood flow disturbances in carotid arteries. The investigations were done in 110 patients with symptoms of cerebral circulatory disorders. In 45 patients carotid arteriography was done. In 30 cases arterial reconstructive operations were performed. The curves of blood flow velocity in the common carotid arteries were recorded with a UDP-10 ultrasound blood flow detector. The obtained curves were subjected to morphological analysis and the mean momentary velocity of the systolic and diastolic flow wave was calculated. In 80% of cases with impaired patency of the carotid arteries demonstrated by angiography abnormal curves of blood flow velocity in the common carotid arteries were obtained. The method of ultrasound recording of blood flow velocity is non-invasive and safe and it is very useful for establishing indications to angiography and for postoperative control.
