The authors report their experience with intraoperative Doppler spectrum analysis of carotid flow after thromboendoarterectomy. The method seems to be useful in the early localisation of technical defects potentially responsible for postoperative stroke. In 22 patients operated on consecutively, three major abnormalities were detected, one of the internal and two of the external carotid. This enabled immediate reexploration of the involved artery with restoration of normal flow. This kind of examination is also safe, quick and highly accurate. The authors propose it as a substitute to intraoperative arteriography which is routinely performed by some surgeons after carotid thromboendoarterectomy.
