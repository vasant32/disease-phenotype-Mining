A patient had transient ischemic attacks and venous stasis retinopathy due to an occlusion of the common carotid artery. Medical therapy controlled the cerebral symptoms but the venous stasis retinopathy progressed over ten months until neovascularization of disc and iris were present. Panretinal photocoagulation resulted in resolution of ocular ischemic changes over six months. Panretinal photocoagulation may be an effective therapy in patients with ocular neovascularization secondary to carotid occlusive disease which is not amenable to endarterectomy or extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass.
