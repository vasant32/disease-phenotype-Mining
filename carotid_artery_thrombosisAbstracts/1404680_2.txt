Polytetrafluoroethylene interposition grafts were used for carotid reconstruction in 26 operations performed in 23 patients during a 7-year period. There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 66 years. The indication for interposition graft placement was recurrent stenosis with inability to perform endarterectomy in nine operations, a severe kink or technical problem during endarterectomy in nine, aneurysmal changes of the artery in six, and thrombosis of the endarterectomy site segment with stroke in two. There were no perioperative deaths and no further perioperative neurologic complications. Follow-up with performance of yearly duplex scans was obtained in all patients, and the mean duration of follow-up was 36 months. One patient (4%) died of end-stage pulmonary disease during the study interval. Occlusion of the polytetrafluoroethylene graft occurred at 12 months in one patient (4%). Hemodynamically significant restenosis developed in two patients (8%), and two patients (8%) had mild restenosis. Evidence of a second restenosis developed in three of the nine patients who underwent polytetrafluoroethylene interposition graft placement for carotid restenosis. On the basis of our study results, we conclude that polytetrafluoroethylene can be used effectively for carotid reconstruction when an interposition graft is required. However, recurrent stenosis occurs. Patients who undergo polytetrafluoroethylene interposition graft placement for carotid restenosis appear to be at high risk for a second restenosis.
