INTRODUCTION: Atherothrombotic disease such as coronary artery disease and stroke is one of major causes of death. Platelets play important role in these arterial diseases. Suppression of platelet activity by materials may decrease incidence of the disease. The present study aimed to examine the peptides from pork meat with antithrombotic activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peptide fraction or hydrolyzate of defatted pork meat by papain was used as the starting material. Antithrombotic activity of the fraction was assessed by a share-induced platelet function test in vitro (haemostatometry) using non-anticoagulated rat blood, followed by a helium-neon laser-induced mouse carotid artery thrombosis test in vivo. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The starting peptide fraction with mean molecular weight 2500 showed antithrombotic activity in vivo after oral administration to mice at 210 mg/kg body weight. The fraction with mean molecular weight 2517 further purified by cation exchange chromatography showed antithrombotic activity after oral administration at 70 mg/kg body weight. Antithrombotic activity of the purified peptide fraction was equivalent to that of aspirin at 50 mg/kg body weight. It is possible this pork peptide could be beneficial to prevent atherothrombosis.
