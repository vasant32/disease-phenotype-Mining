By means of colour-coded Doppler sonography we studied retrospectively the incidence of postoperative changes in 54 patients following 58 carotid endarterectomies. The interval between operation and ultrasound varied from one to 41 months. The overall incidence of recurrent carotid disease was 50% with a 31% (18 of 58) of hemodynamically insignificant restenoses, a 13.8% (8 of 58) incidence of haemodynamically significant restenoses, and a 5.2% (3 of 58) of occlusions. The segment that had been endarterectomized showed a bulbous dilatation in 24.1% (14 of 58). In all of these cases extensive flow reversal zones could be demonstrated, the possible importance of which is discussed. Examinations in 9 patients with reimplantation of subclavian artery to the common carotid artery and grafting technique between these arteries and in 11 patients with reimplantation of vertebral artery to the common carotid artery demonstrated one occlusion of the ipsilateral vertebral artery.
