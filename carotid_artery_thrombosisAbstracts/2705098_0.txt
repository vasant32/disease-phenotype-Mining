A 15-year experience with 98 patients who underwent extracranial artery reconstruction for symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion is reviewed. Thromboendarterectomy of the occluded carotid artery resulted in unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates, and long-term patency of the internal carotid artery was rarely achieved. Carotid endarterectomy on the side opposite the occlusion proved to be successful in relieving nonlateralizing symptoms of cerebral ischemia, whereas results were less encouraging in patients with focal symptoms in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion. External carotid artery reconstruction on the side of the occlusion was successful in relieving focal symptoms. Surgical treatment in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion should be planned in each patient on the basis of symptoms and anatomic pattern.
