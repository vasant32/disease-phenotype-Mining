A comparison was made between pre- and postoperative cerebral blood flow measurements in 20 patients who underwent endarterectomy. Most patients showed no difference between both studies. However in 4 of the series an increase in blood flow was observed while in another 4 patients a decrease occurred. Especially patients with a low preoperative flow seemed to have profited from the endarterectomy.
