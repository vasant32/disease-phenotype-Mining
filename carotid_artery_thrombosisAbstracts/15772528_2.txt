Acute coronary syndromes are caused by platelet-mediated thrombosis following rupture of a plaque. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce the incidence of events early after acute coronary syndromes, which are independent of its cholesterol-lowering effect. Accordingly, we investigated whether statins inhibit platelet-mediated arterial thrombus formation in vivo and, if so, the underlying mechanisms. Rats were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 was treated with the vehicle, whereas groups 2, 3, and 4 were treated with cerivastatin for 7 days (1, 2, and 5 mg/kg i.p., respectively). Cerivatatin did not change serum cholesterol levels. Carotid arterial thrombosis was created by perivascular FeCl3 delivery. Cerivastatin significantly prolonged the time to thrombotic occlusion of carotid artery. Cerivastatin significantly dose-dependently inhibited both ex vivo platelet P-selectin expression, a marker of platelet activation, and platelet aggregation. Cerivastatin significantly augmented platelet-derived nitric oxide (NO) release, and up-regulated platelet and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA expressions. N-nitro-L-arginine methylester abolished the effects of cerivastatin. This study demonstrates that in vivo administration of statin protects against platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis, possibly by augmenting platelet- and endothelium-derived NO releases via up-regulation of platelet and endothelial NOS.
