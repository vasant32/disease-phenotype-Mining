Carotid infiltration by a cervical metastatic node, although uncommon, has a poor prognosis and controversial treatment. We report the case of a 59-year-old male patient with a metastatic node of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown origin and a clinical onset in the form of ischemic cerebrovascular accident caused by ipsilateral occlusion of the internal carotid. Radical neck dissection was performed, sparing the carotid artery, which was not infiltrated by the tumor. The pathogenesis of carotid occlusion is discussed and the literature reviewed.
