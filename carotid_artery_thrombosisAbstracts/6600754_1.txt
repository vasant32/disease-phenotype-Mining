Selective arteriographic infusion of krypton-81m was used to obtain cerebral single photon emission computed tomograms. These were then superimposed on X-ray computed tomograms to assess topographically the perfusion of the entire brain. This method enhances the detecting capability for abnormal perfusion areas and has been used in 21 patients with various brain diseases.
