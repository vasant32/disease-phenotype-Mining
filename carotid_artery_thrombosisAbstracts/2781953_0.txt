The use of transcranial Doppler sonography (TDS) in combined ultrasound diagnosis was the first to allow a noninvasive assessment of cerebral circulation. Altogether 50 patients in acute stroke period were examined. The results obtained were verified at surgery, cerebral angiography or autopsy. Changes in the velocity of the blood flow, its reversal, different Doppler sonogram pattern appeared controversial for cerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhages caused by the occlusion of the internal carotid artery or other factors of encephalomalacia. TDS employment promotes the improvement in the diagnosis of the cause underlying the acute impairment of cerebral circulation and in the prognosis of cerebral coma. The findings are correlated with routine echo-pulsography and Doppler sonography.
