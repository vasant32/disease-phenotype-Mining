 OBJECTIVE: To screen the main component of Dahuangzhechong pill's anti-arterial thrombosis with the orthogonal design and refine Dahuangzhechong pills. METHODS: In accordance with the orthogonal design table (L(16)2(15)), divided herbs into 16 groups and made the appropriate liquid. The liquid was gave to SD rats by intragastric administration,the model group, normal control group received the same volume of physiological saline. Isolated rats' carotid artery after intragastric administration a week,modeled according to ferric chloride inducement the carotid artery thrombosis method, then collected blood, detected content of platelet, thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto-PGF1alpha), sheared and measured dry weight of the modeling artery, then placed arteries in 10% formalin fixation, observed morphological changes in vascular tissue by HE staining. RESULTS: Pathological examination revealed: each experimental group had thrombosis, softening, dissolution, absorption, and intimal injury, but the severity of thrombosis were diferent. Orthogonal analysis showed: 1, influence on dry weight of thrombus: rhubarb, ground beetle, leeches, peach seed, dry paint, except dry paint P<0.05, the others P<0.01.2, influence on plasma 6- keto-PGF1alpha level: peach seed, dry paint, ground beetle, gadfly, grubs, leeches, rhubarb, except rhubarb P<0.05, the others P<0.01.3, influence on plasma TXB2: ground beetle, peach seed, dried paint, rhubarb, leeches, except leech P<0.05, the others P<0.01.4, influence on platelet count: peach seed, dry paint, rhubarb, ground beetle, gadfly, leeches, except gadfly, leeches P<0.05, the others P<0.01. CONCLUSION: Anti-artery thrombosis of Dahuangzhechong Pill is most closely related with rhubarb, ground beetle, leeches, peach seed, dry paint and gadfly.
