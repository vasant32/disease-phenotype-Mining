In the occlusion of the internal carotid artery, the change occurring in the internal-external carotid pressure gradient may cause flow reversal within the ophthalmic artery and its branches. Ophthalmodynamographic, Doppler directional sonographic and angiographic investigations were performed in 21 cases (11 total occlusions, 6 severe and 4 moderate stenoses of the internal carotid artery). The authors compare the results of these investigations and discuss the practical importance of Doppler directional sonography and the significance of flow reversal in the ophthalmic artery.
