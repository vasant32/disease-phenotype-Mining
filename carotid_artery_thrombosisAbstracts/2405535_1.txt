Duplex imaging has been widely embraced as a safe and an accurate means of interrogating the extracranial carotid vessels. One reason for this is its appearance as a risk-free diagnostic tool. We report the cases of two patients in whom transient ischemic attacks developed during duplex imaging--attacks that began soon after application of the ultrasound transducer to the cervical region, were identical to prior attacks, and ceased within seconds of removal of the transducer from the neck. The underlying cause of this complication is discussed as is its proper management.
