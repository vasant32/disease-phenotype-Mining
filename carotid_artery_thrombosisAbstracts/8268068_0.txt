In an attempt to eliminate the morbidity, mortality, and cost associated with arteriography, surgeons are relying increasingly on duplex scanning of the extracranial arteries as the primary preoperative evaluation prior to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This study was initiated to evaluate the need for cerebral arteriography in the preoperative evaluation of patients for CEA. One hundred five patients undergoing 114 CEA procedures are included in a retrospective review to determine whether the addition of cerebral arteriography changed the operative management of these patients. In 58 of 105 patients (55%), color-flow duplex scanning and cerebral arteriography were performed in the workup prior to CEA. In four patients a discrepancy was found between the duplex results and the arteriogram, leading to a change in the operative approach in two. The remaining 47 patients (45%) underwent color-flow duplex scanning as the definitive preoperative study; the surgical management was altered because of the operative findings in one patient. Although color-flow duplex scanning does not provide absolute concordance with cerebral arteriography, in most instances it can be used as the definitive preoperative study prior to CEA. We define the indications for cerebral arteriography in patients undergoing CEA.
