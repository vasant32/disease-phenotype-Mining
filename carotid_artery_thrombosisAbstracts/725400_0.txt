The authors report 76 cases of carotid obstruction, mainly localized at the origin of the carotid artery, that have been operated upon in emergency. Two types of lesions are considered: occlusion and very tight stenosis. The principle of early surgery in cases of acute occlusion is very controverse. According to the facts reported (38 cases) results are rewarding when operative decision is taken under precise conditions judged as favorable: short lapse of time since occlusive onset, absence of intracranial hypertension, absence of comatose state and no sign of brain oedema. Some patients under go surgery in the priviledged condition of being already in a medico-surgical unit (post operative, post angiographic, embolic occlusions). Majority present the most common hemiplegic attack. However difficulty resides in the inefficient mode of transport to hospital and lack of highly specialized units on admission. A very tight stenosis (at extreme a pseudo-occlusive stenosis) with clinical recurrent deficit, modified Loppler's recording and hemodynamic repercussion at angiography is an operative emergency. When results of early surgery on 38 cases of stenosis are compared to those of late operation in 14 similar cases early decision becomes compulsory once tight stenosis of the carotid artery is identified and operative criteria respected. In the light of this report that "wait and see attitude" needs be somewhat revised when confronted to the dramatic ictal hemiplegia.
