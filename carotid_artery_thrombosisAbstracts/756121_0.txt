Percutaneous measurements by Doppler ultrasound techniques over the supratrochlear, supraorbital, common carotid and internal carotid arteries may detect the presence of a stenosis in the internal carotid artery between the bifurcation and the branching of the ophthalmic artery. Out of 550 patients examined by Doppler ultrasound 111 patients underwent carotid angiography and the angiographic data were compared with the noninvasive results. The diagnostic accuracy was 91% in cases with stenoses greater than 50% and occlusion; in cases with stenoses of greater than 50% it was 86%. Occlusions could always be verified. Doppler ultrasound is very valuable for follow-up examinations after reconstructive procedures of the internal carotid artery. In 70 patients we were able to document objectively cases by pre- and postoperative examinations.
