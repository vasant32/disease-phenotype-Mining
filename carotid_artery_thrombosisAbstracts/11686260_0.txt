We report upon a patient with multiple, progressive episodes of temporary monocular blindness associated with acute thrombosis and a critical internal carotid artery stenosis. Carotid angiography demonstrated an anatomically compelling situation consisting of a critical reduction of flow distal to a preocclusive internal carotid artery stenosis accompanied by intraluminal thrombus. The patient was managed successfully by urgent thrombectomy and carotid endarterectomy. This case report highlights principles in management of patients with the unstable neurologic condition of temporary monocular blindness associated with an anatomically compelling situation demonstrated on angiography.
