The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral prostaglandin E(1)(PGE(1)) on the patency of the microvascular anastomosis of the carotid artery in rat. A total of 48 rats were used, and divided into three groups. The first group (A) was used as a control with no medical agent being used after anastomosis, the second group (B) was medicated with aspirin, and the third group (C) was medicated with oral PGE(1). In each group, four rats were sacrificed serially on every post-operative 3, 5, 10 and 15 days after arterial anastomosis. Patency and histologic evaluations at the anastomotic site were observed. The results revealed that the PGE(1) therapied group showed highest patency rate (100%), lesser formation of mural thrombosis, and also minimal changes in the intimal hyperplasia and medial fibrosis. From these findings, we could conclude that PGE(1) has superior effect on maintaining the patency after microvascular surgery.
