A 59-year-old man with a previous left frontal lobe infarction sustained an infarction of the right frontal lobe. The patient manifested a bilateral symmetrical blepharoptosis that resolved in two months. Eyelid movements seem to be bilaterally represented in the frontal lobes. Bilateral cortical disease can produce supranuclear eyelid abnormalities such as blepharoptosis, difficulty maintaining eyelid position, and difficulty initiating eyelid movement.
