The role of plasminogen (Plg) and alpha2-antiplasmin (alpha2-AP) in vascular thrombolysis in vivo was investigated in mice deficient in plasminogen (Plg-/-) or a2-AP (alpha2-AP-/-) or their wild type (PAI-1+/+, alpha2-AP+/+). A thrombus was induced in the murine carotid artery or the internal jugular vein by endothelial injury. Blood flow was continuously monitored for 90 min and for 6 h 30 min after the initiation of endothelial injury. The times to occlusion by the developing thrombus in the carotid artery and the jugular vein of wild type mice were 12+/-1.8 and 7.2+/-1.9 min, respectively. The arterial thrombus formation in alpha2-AP-/- mice was indistinguishable from the one in wild type mice, whereas the time to occlusion in Plg-/- was significantly shortened to 5.9+/-1.7 min. Vascular patency after spontaneous reperfusion was markedly improved in alpha2-AP-/- mice. On the contrary, arteriarpatency in Plg-/- mice was aggravated. In venous thrombus formation, the time to occlusion in alpha2-AP-/- mice was significantly prolonged (27.1+/-5.2 min), whereas in Plg-/- it was slightly shortened to 6.5+/-2.5 min. Vascular patency after spontaneous reperfusion was also improved in alpha2-AP-/- mice, but not in Plg-/- mice. Histological observations using SEM indicated that fibrin nets were firmly fixed on the injured area in Plg-/- mice, but not in alpha2-AP-/- mice. The tail bleeding time was not different in any type of mice. However, re-bleeding time using a template bleeding device was significantly prolonged in alpha2-AP-/- as compared with that of wild type mice. In conclusion, lack of plasminogen markedly reduces the antithrombotic activities in vivo, whereas alpha2-AP plays a more important role in the formation and removal of venous thrombus in mice. Consequently, the inhibition of alpha2-AP could be a useful tool for the therapy of venous thrombosis and the prevention of re-thrombus formation.
