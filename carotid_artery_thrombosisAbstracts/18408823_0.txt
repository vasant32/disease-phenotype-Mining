In the management of penetrating carotid injuries, the surgeon must act in an emergency way to prevent active bleeding and to restore cerebral blood flow. Preservation of the carotid circulation decreases morby-mortality in these patients. Controversial diagnostic and therapeutic approach remain when no signs of bleeding or neurological ischemia are evident. The authors report the case of a male patient submitted to an emergency operation to repair a internal carotid thrombosis consequence of a penetrating gunshot injury at the area II of the neck. We reviewed the literature related to this condition and the different methods of treatment that can be employed.
