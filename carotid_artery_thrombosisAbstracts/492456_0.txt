Three cases of brain abscess following an occlusion of the internal carotid artery were reported. Case 1: A 6-year-old girl with congenital heart disease was admitted with headache, disturbance of consciousness and left hemiparesis. Right carotid angiography revealed an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. After 6 months, she was readmitted with high fever. CT scan revealed a low density area and a ring-like shadow at the same site of cerebral infarction. Case 2: A 69-year-old man was admitted in semicoma and with right hemiplegia. Left angiography revealed an occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. After 2 months, a brain abscess was noted in the infarcted area. Case 3: A 20-year-old man with congenital heart disease, was admitted due to headache, vomiting and high fever. CT scan revealed a brain abscess in the right frontal lobe. Carotid angiography showed bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. We concluded that diminution of cerebral oxygen and encephalomalacia are predisposing factors to the evolution of brain abscess.
