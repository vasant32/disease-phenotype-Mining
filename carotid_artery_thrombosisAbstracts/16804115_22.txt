Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for thrombosis, but the mechanisms are not well defined. We tested the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia accelerates arterial thrombosis in mice. Mice heterozygous for a targeted disruption of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (Cbs+/-) and wild-type littermates (Cbs+/+) were fed either a control diet or a high methionine/low folate (HM/LF) diet for 6 to 8 months to produce graded hyperhomocysteinemia. The time to occlusion of the carotid artery after photochemical injury was shortened by more than 50% in Cbs+/+ or Cbs+/- mice fed the HM/LF diet (P < .001 versus control diet). Carotid artery thrombosis was not accelerated in mice deficient in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Nos3), which suggests that decreased endothelium-derived nitric oxide is not a sufficient mechanism for enhancement of thrombosis. Cbs+/+ and Cbs+/- mice fed the HM/LF diet had elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in the carotid artery, increased aortic expression of the NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit, Nox4, and decreased activation of anticoagulant protein C in the aorta (P < .05 versus control diet). We conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia enhances susceptibility to arterial thrombosis through a mechanism that is not caused by loss of endothelium-derived nitric oxide but may involve oxidative stress and impairment of the protein C anticoagulant pathway.
