The problem of asymptomatic stenoses of the internal carotid artery (ICA) has become a matter of great concern especially after ultrasonography of the great arteries of the head and, first of all, duplex scanning were introduced on a wide-scale basis into practice of the physicians of varying specialties. The growing population of patients with asymptomatic stenoses raises the problem of their further management with the purpose of preventing ischemic stroke. In connection with significant advances in vascular surgery carotid endarterectomy (CEE) has assumed an increasing role in the treatment of carotid stenoses. In spite of the fact that the efficacy of CEE for hemodynamically significant stenoses has already been proven, nevertheless at present there is no final decision concerning the problem of the indications for surgical treatment of patients with asymptomatic stenoses. The aim of this study was to assess in detail the vascular system of the brain in patients presenting with stenosis greater than 60% and ICA thrombosis, to distinguish the groups at a high risk for stroke and to delineate the treatment measures for its prevention.
