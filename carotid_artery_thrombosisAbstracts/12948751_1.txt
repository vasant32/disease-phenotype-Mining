Antithrombotic activity of catalase (CAT) and chondroitin sulfate (CHS) preparations was studied in a rat model of arterial injury induced by ferrous chloride. Equal doses (according to catalytically active CAT) were used to examine the effect of native CAT, CAT-CHS covalent conjugate and mixture of native CAT and free CHS in a ratio corresponding to their contents in the conjugate. The antithrombotic activity of the derivatives was determined by the time during which arterial occlusion developed (occlusion time) and by the mass of the formed thrombus. The antithrombotic activities of the conjugate and mixture were similar and markedly higher than that of native CAT. The conjugate was more effective with respect to deceleration and prevention of arterial occlusion. Small doses of the preparations altered the structure of the formed thrombus, promoting sustained blood flow. Further investigations of the antithrombotic activity of CAT, superoxide dismutase and CHS derivatives have been outlined.
