 OBJECTIVE: The association between cancer and venous thrombosis is well established, however, that between malignancy and arterial thrombosis is less well described. Isolated cases have been reported and chemotherapy has been implicated as a cause though its significance compared with the malignant disease process itself is not known. This study examines the outcome of patients with malignant disease who present with arterial thrombosis. METHOD: Details of patients with malignant disease who presented with arterial thrombosis were analysed. RESULTS: Twenty patients presented with malignancy and arterial thrombosis, 16 presented in the last four years. The most common malignancy was metastatic breast cancer. Thrombosis involved the leg in 19 cases and the arm in one. Four patients also had venous thromboembolic events and one had a carotid artery thrombosis. Eight patients underwent operative treatment for their thrombosis. Five out of six thromboembolectomies and two out of three bypass procedures failed. Twelve had conservative or palliative treatment. Outcome was generally poor, two patients had major amputations and seventeen died at median follow-up of eight weeks. Survival rate from the time of presentation of arterial thrombosis was 50% at three months and 17% at one year. CONCLUSION: Patients with critical limb ischaemia due to atherosclerotic disease have an expected survival of approximately 80% at one year. The outcome of patients with arterial thrombosis associated with malignant disease is far worse. Arterial thrombosis is an agonal event in many of these patients. Conservative or palliative treatment may be the most appropriate management.
