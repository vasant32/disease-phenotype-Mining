Carotid T occlusion (intracranial carotid bifurcation occlusion with involvement of A1 and M1 segments) is associated with poor outcome. In most cases, treatment with intraarterial thrombolysis within a 6-hour window has been unsuccessful. We describe the case of a 26-year-old woman who presented with severe neurologic deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 23) secondary to angiographically proved right carotid T occlusion. She was treated with intraarterial infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator that was started less than 3 hours after symptom onset (26 mg administered during 2 hours 15 minutes). Thrombolysis resulted in recanalization of all major intracranial vessels and complete neurologic recovery. Early intraarterial thrombolysis may be effective in the treatment of patients with carotid T occlusion and should be considered for appropriate candidates.
