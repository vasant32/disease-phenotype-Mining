Thrombosed intracranial aneurysms are always large aneurysms with a diameter superior to 25 mm. They are easily detected by computed tomography, but their diagnosis when they are located in the sphenoidosellar region may cause problems. Three cases of giant aneurysms have been discovered by CT scan over a period of 27 months.
