Over the last few years, many authors have described the possibility of using transcranial Doppler to demonstrate the passage of microemboli in the cerebral arteries. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with thrombotic diathesis and thrombocytosis who was admitted twice within a short period of time (one and a half months) to a neurological department because of multiple cerebral infarctions. On the occasion of the second admission, a colour-Doppler examination of the epiaortic vessels, which had previously been negative, showed a carotid lesion due to a mural thrombus and, on the same side as the carotid lesion, transcranial Doppler detected short-duration, high-intensity signals in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, an expression of the passage of microemboli. As already described by other authors in similar clinical situations, our case confirms that transcranial Doppler can identify the passage of microemboli in the circle of Willis.
