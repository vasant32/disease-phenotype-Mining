The hospital records and head CT scans of 44 patients with hemorrhagic infarction were retrospectively analyzed. The majority of cases (73%) were embolic or possibly embolic in etiology, and 55% were not associated with anticoagulant therapy. Adverse prognosis was most clearly related to infarct size, underlying systemic illness, and symptomatic hemorrhage. Of the nineteen patients in whom serial CT scans documented conversion from bland to hemorrhagic infarction, 12 exhibited no clinical worsening at the time that hemorrhagic infarction was observed; the remaining seven, all of whom worsened, were receiving anticoagulant therapy at the time of documented conversion. Fourteen patients in whom anticoagulant therapy was used despite the findings of hemorrhagic infarction remained stable or improved during hospitalization.
