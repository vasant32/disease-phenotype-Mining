A case of left common carotid artery occlusion, which was treated by a saphenous vein graft, is reported. A 49-year-old right handed male was admitted to the hospital because of right hemiparesis and aphasia. These symptoms disappeared spontaneously two weeks after admission. However, visual acuity remained impaired on the left side due to occlusion of the central retinal artery. Angiography revealed complete occlusion of the common carotid arteries as well as patency of the internal carotid arteries on both sides. PET and 123I-IMP-SPECT studies showed hypoperfusion in the left cerebral hemisphere. To restore the blood flow as well as to remove the source of the emboli, endarterectomy was performed on the left internal carotid artery. This was followed by a saphenous vein graft between the left subclavian and the internal carotid artery. Postoperative angiography revealed patency of the bypass, and a SPECT study revealed increased blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere. The patient has remained in stable condition during the following 30 months with no neurological problems. We conclude that in the treatment of complete occlusion of the common carotid artery and subsequent cerebral hypoperfusion, a bypass graft between the internal carotid and the subclavian artery is quite effective, and that the site of the bypass graft should carefully be sought for by using preoperative angiographic studies.
