The article deals with diagnostic and clinical examination conducted before and in different periods after operation for formation of extra- and intracranial microvascular anastomoses (EICMA) in 57 patients with occlusive lesions of the cerebral vessels. Preoperative angiography was undertaken to identify the character of the vascular lesion, study the collateral circulation, and appraise the condition of the other channels. Control angiography was performed in the early (the first 2 weeks) and late-term postoperative periods (from 3 to 48 months). Functioning EICMA were demonstrated in the first 1-2 days in 11%, at the end of the 2nd week in 70%, and in the late-term postoperative period in 92% of cases. Comparative analysis of the character of EICMA functioning depending on the collateral circulation showed them to be functioning in 80% of patients despite satisfactory development of collateral circulation along the parts of the circle of Willis through the orbital anastomosis.
