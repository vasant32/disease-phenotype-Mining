We report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery. A 33-year-old woman suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after treatment with FSH/HCG for in-vitro fertilization. She developed a transient left hemiparesis. This was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery. Open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms.
