Stroke is the third leading cause of death in many countries worldwide. The vast majority of acute strokes is ischaemic, caused often by embolisation from the large arteries of the head and neck, less frequently by cardiogenic embolisation. A case report of a patient with mobile thrombus at the origin of the internal carotid artery diagnosed by duplex sonography is presented. The patient refused surgery, two days later a recurrent severe stroke occurred caused by embolisation of the found thrombus.
