Chronic "fixed" neurological deficits do not appear to be entirely beyond amelioration by surgical operation even in the presence of considerable intracranial disease. Improvement in the particularly important spheres of verbal communication and mental dexterity may be anticipated in some patients. The presence of multiple vessel involvement is additional stimulus to operative intervention. Failure to carry out arteriographic examination in cases of "chronic" stroke, or relying too much on the results of such an examination as an indication of local inoperability may lead to errors in treatment. Likewise, exploration of the "occluded" carotid artery in patients with multiple vessel disease may show patent distal vessels in a worthwhile number of cases.
