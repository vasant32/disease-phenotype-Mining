PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral simultaneous central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) following head injury in a young 29-year-old man. METHODS: A 29-year-old man presented with head injury following road traffic accident. Posterior segment evaluation revealed CRAO in both eyes. RESULTS: The patient was treated for CRAO in the form of immediate ocular massage, paracentesis, intravenous mannitol and transdermal isosorbide dinitrate patch. Despite treatment the vision continued to be no perception of light. Systemic investigations were unremarkable. Color Doppler of carotid arteries showed plaque in left carotid bulb and thrombus in right internal carotid artery. CONCLUSION: Bilateral simultaneous CRAO following head trauma has not been reported earlier. Thorough ocular examination is recommended in all cases of head injury.
