Strokes are rarely secondary to spontaneous carotid artery thrombosis. The objectives of this retrospective analysis were to define characteristic features and the clinical course. The study population included eight patients (6 females/2 males) seen at six university neurological centers. Age of onset was 46.5 years (range 38-52). Half of the patients had no vascular risk factor. Symptoms were TIA (n=1), strokes (n=7). Echotomography revealed intraluminal thrombus, with occlusion in 2 cases. Thrombi were found in common carotid artery (n=3), carotid bifurcation (n=2) and internal carotid artery (n=3). The thrombus was mobile in 4 cases. Seven patients were treated by anticoagulation therapy, one by surgery because of recurrent TIA. Further echotomographic exams revealed total resolution (3 cases) or decrease of the thrombus (3 cases). Occlusion was definitive in one patient. A cause was identified in six patients: acute leukemia (n=1), thrombocytopenic purpura (n=1), iron deficiency anemia (n=4).
