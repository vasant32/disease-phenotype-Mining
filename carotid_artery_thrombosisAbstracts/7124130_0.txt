The status of the large vessels of the neck was determined after emergency intubation in 65 primary atraumatic casualties in the endeavor to provide accident surgeons working under extreme conditions with a check on results to optimize their therapy. Besides the findings in the vertebral artery (shown in 35 cases), which was traumatized in one case, the main attention was dedicated to the injury pattern of the common carotid artery. In this artery, intimal ruptures within the bifurcation were found in three cases, combined in one case with a subintimal hemorrhage on the contralateral side. As compared to other forms of force leading to an injury of the common carotid artery, reanimation causing traction and hyperextension of the neck is also considered an injurious stress. The unconscious patient is especially endangered as he has no possibility of pain-elicited defense if a helper hyperextends the neck under pressure from below in the vertex of the lordosis.
