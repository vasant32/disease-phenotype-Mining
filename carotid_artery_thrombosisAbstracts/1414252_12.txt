We have tested the feasibility of local intraarterial thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke in the carotid artery territories observed within 5 h of the onset of symptoms. Only 5 of 615 consecutive patients were enrolled. They were 1 man and 4 women aged 50 to 75 years. Angiography disclosed occlusion of the M2 tract in one, of the M3 tract in one, of the carotid siphon in one of M4 tract in two. Intraarterial urokinase was infused at a mean dosage of 560,000 units close to the site of occlusion. Four of them had partial or complete recanalisation at early angiographic control and were independent at 6th month control. The one who did not demonstrate recanalisation was confined to a wheelchair. One patient, who had recanalisation, sustained a hemorrhagic transformation of the brain ischemia not interfering with outcome. Our experience, at the light of the low rate of enrollment, despite the results, suggest that intraarterial thrombolysis may be a therapeutic tool for selected patients with stroke in the carotid artery territories and not a routinary treatment for them.
