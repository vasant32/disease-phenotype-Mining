OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of anti-thrombus of different extracts from Semen Persicae and provide experimental basis for finding and defining effective fraction of Semen Persicae. METHODS: The effects of different extracts from Semen Persicae on clotting time in mice, pulmonary embolism in mice and electro-irritate thrombosis in rats were observed. RESULT: Ethyl acetate extract from Semen Persicae could prolong clotting time in mice, markedly relieve respiratory difficult due to pulmonary embolism in mice induced by ADP-Na, obviously retard the generation of thrombosis induced by electrical injury of carotid artery in rats. CONCLUSION: Ethyl acetate extract from Semen Persicae possesses evidently anti-thrombotic effect.
