In a patient with acute cardioembolic stroke, ultrasonographic studies demonstrated the disappearance of an oscillating intraluminal thrombus lodged at the carotid bifurcation. Following the commencement of immediate anticoagulation, the thrombus completely dissolved over two weeks without further deterioration in the patient's symptoms. Neurosonographic studies are useful for the detection and follow-up of an intraluminal thrombus in acute stroke patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy.
