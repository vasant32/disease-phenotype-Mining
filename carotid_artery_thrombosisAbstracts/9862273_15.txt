PTCA is a well-established intervention to reduce the severity of atherosclerotic coronary stenosis. Its primary success rate is seriously handicapped by the high incidence of late restenosis. Given the clinical and social importance of this proliferative process, new strategies are needed to prevent or reduce restenosis. Several animal models as well as different arteries have been used to study neointimal proliferation after arterial injury. A number of agents have shown to reduce neointimal proliferation after arterial injury in the carotids and iliac arteries of rodent models. Unfortunately, these results have not been replicated in humans. We have compared the acute and late response to vascular injury of the carotid and coronary arteries in the pig. Arterial injury was induced by performing balloon angioplasty of the carotid (elastic) and coronary (muscular) arteries in swine. Acute platelet-thrombus formation was evaluated by quantitation of Indium-labeled platelets deposited on the injured segments 1 h after procedure. Measurement of intimal area was performed by morphometry of the most stenotic cross-section at 28 days after balloon angioplasty. Platelet deposition after mild and severe injury in carotids (4 +/- 1 and 56 +/- 13 x 10(6) platelets/cm2, respectively) and coronaries (15 +/- 5 and 141 +/- 20 x 10(6) platelets/cm2, respectively) are significantly greater in deep, than in mild injury (P < 0.005), and significantly greater in coronary than in carotid arteries after deep injury (P < 0.05). Likewise, late neointima formation was significantly greater (P < 0.05) after mild and severe injury in coronary (17 +/- 0.5 and 56 +/- 2%, respectively) than in carotid arteries (5 +/- 0.5 and 12 +/- 1%, respectively). Acute platelet-thrombus formation and late neointimal thickening are modulated by the degree of injury induced during the interventions; and after disruption of the internal elastic lamina, coronary arteries always had significantly more acute thrombus and neointimal thickening. This study emphasizes the importance of the animal species, the type of injury and the artery chosen for studies on restenosis post interventions.
