 BACKGROUND: The efficacy of emergency carotid thromboendarterectomy (CTEA) for acute internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombosis has been questioned. We evaluated the use of CTEA in patients with recent ICA occlusion. METHODS: From August 1989 to December 1999 patients who underwent urgent CTEA for recent ICA thrombosis were retrospectively evaluated. Patient data analyzed included age, sex, comorbid risk factors, diagnostic evaluation, operative procedure, and long-term follow-up with clinical assessment and carotid duplex scan. Neurologic status was evaluated with the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) before the operation, immediately after the operation, and at 3- to 6-months' follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent emergency ipsilateral CTEA for acute ICA thrombosis over the last 10 years. The average age of the patients was 69.9 +/- 1.7 years, and 66% were men. Patient risk factors included diabetes (7 [24%]), hypertension (21 [72%]), coronary artery disease (8 [29%]), and history of tobacco abuse (20 [69%]). Presenting symptoms included cerebrovascular accident (7 [24%]), transient ischemic attack (nonamaurosis) (10 [34%]), crescendo transient ischemic attack (7 [24%]), stroke in evolution (2 [7%]), and amaurosis fugax (3 [10%]). Diagnostic evaluation included computed tomographic scan (29 [100%]), magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (4 [14%]), duplex scan evaluation of the carotid arteries (23 [79%]), and cerebral angiography (18 [64%]). Antegrade flow in the ICA was successfully established in 24 (83%) of 29 patients and confirmed with intraoperative angiography or duplex sonography. Postoperative morbidity included 2 hematomas (7%), 4 transient cranial nerve deficits (14%), and 1 conversion to hemorrhagic stroke (3.6%), which resulted in the only death (3.6%). MRS scores averaged 3.4 +/- 0.2 preoperatively. Follow-up averaging 74.1 +/- 21 months (range, 3-140 months) was obtained in 27 (93%) patients. Improvement or deterioration was defined as a change in MRS +/- 1. Immediately postoperatively, 14 (48%) patients were improved, 2 (7%) deteriorated, and 13 (45%) had no change. At 3 to 6 months, 20 (74%) of 27 patients were improved, seven (26%) had no change, and none deteriorated. Of patients with successful CTEA, 23 (96%) of 24 had a patent ICA on follow-up duplex scan evaluation, and there was no evidence of recurrent ipsilateral neurologic events at an average of 49 months. CONCLUSION: These data support an aggressive early surgical intervention for acute ICA thrombosis in carefully selected patients. In the previous decade we reported a 46% success rate for establishing antegrade flow in the ICA long term. Data from this decade show a 79% (P =.0114) success rate for establishing antegrade flow long term in all patients undergoing emergency CTEA. New and improved imaging modalities have allowed better patient selection, resulting in improved outcomes.
