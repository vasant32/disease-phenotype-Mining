Intracranial endovascular procedures are less invasive and relatively safe; however, these procedures do carry a risk of complications, such as thromboembolization, arterial injury, and vessel occlusion. We present a case of carotid-cavernous fistula development secondary to injury of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) during stent angioplasty and its treatment by transarterial coil embolization. Probable causes of this complication and its treatment method are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such a case.
