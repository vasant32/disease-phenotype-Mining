Thirty-one carotid artery stenoses were produced in thirty dogs by three different techniques. Twenty-three of these could be cured by transfemoral percutaneous catheter dilatation. High grade tight stenoses may present resistance which cannot be overcome by the catheter. Histological examination of the dilated vessels showed circumscribed changes in the vessel wall, with destruction of elastic membranes. From our experience of catheter dilatation of pelvic and lower limb arteries and of renal arteries, we consider it feasible to use this technique in selected patients with carotid stenosis.
