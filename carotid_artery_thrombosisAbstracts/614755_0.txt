The thrombolytic effect of "ocrase", a protease isolated from Aspergillus ochraceus, was investigated in animal experiments. To prevent general hyperproteolysis a protease dose was used which was was neutralized by the inhibitors in the blood of the animals. Experimentally produced deposition and clotting thrombi in peripheral venous or arterial vessels of mice, rats, dwarf pigs and dogs were lysed by regional and systemic administration, and the therapeutic result was estimated by vital microscopy, rheography or angiography. Coronary thrombosis induced in dwarf pigs was treated semilocally with ocrase, and the therapeutic result was followed by ECG and angiography.
