Carotid artery stenting is gaining wider acceptance as an alternative option in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. Conventional complications such as stroke and recurrent in-stent restenosis are well documented in the literature. However, we believe that carotid stent complications are underreported. The carotid artery segment has features that are relatively smilar to the femoropopliteal segment with respect to forces affecting the stented segment, which can contribute to stent complications such as fracture. In this article, we present a case of internal carotid artery stent fracture and thrombus formation after the patient was exposed to direct trauma to the chest and neck.
