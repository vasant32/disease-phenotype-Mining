Non-invasive ultrasonic imaging of the carotid bifurcation by duplex scanning and ultrasonic arteriography combined with pulsed Doppler spectrum analysis demonstrated patency of the external and internal carotid arteries distal to a common carotid occlusion in 3 patients. Common carotid occlusion is not invariably associated with thrombosis of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. Identification of internal carotid patency by the use of ultrasonic techniques will permit surgical treatment in selected cases.
