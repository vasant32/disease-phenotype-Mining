Patients with carotid artery occlusive disease (CAOD) may be at increased risk of iatrogenic cerebral hypoperfusion. Using the 133xenon-inhalation technique, we evaluated the effects of enalapril on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 14 patients with chronic hypertension, 7 with CAOD and 7 without CAOD (no CAOD). Regional CBF and blood pressure were measured before and 60 minutes after a single dose of enalapril. Changes in mean arterial pressure after enalapril were not significantly different between the two groups: CAOD -4.67 +/- 8.7 mm Hg, no CAOD -6.18 +/- 8.2 mm Hg. Changes in mean CBF after enalapril were also not statistically different: CAOD -1.0 +/- 3.9, no CAOD 1.0 +/- 2.8. In the CAOD group only, however, changes in CBF were significantly related to increasing age (r = -0.9253, p less than 0.01), such that in patients 65 years or older CBF tended to decrease, whereas in younger patients it increased. Elderly patients with CAOD may be at increased risk of iatrogenic cerebral hypoperfusion, and it may be appropriate to evaluate prospectively the effects of antihypertensive medications on CBF.
