OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of FA-I, a novel fibrinolytic enzyme isolated from the metabolite of Arthrobacter sp. DR-536, on thrombosis and thrombolysis in vivo. METHODS: The anticoagulated blood model of mise were administered with FA-I orally. The venous thrombogenesis inhibition model of rats were administered with FA-I by intestinal route. The carotid thrombosis model of rabbits were given FA-I intravenously. The clotting time (CT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), Euglobulin lysis time (ELT), fibrinogen (FIG) and hemorheology condition were analyzed. RESULTS: FA-I prolonged the CT, PT, APTT and TT, and decreased ELT and FIG significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). FA-I also improved the hemorheology conditions in the rabbits. CONCLUSION: Both intravenous injection and oral administration of FA-I are effective in thrombosis and thrombolysis. FA-I could become a pragmatic venoclysis thrombolytic drug or a peroral thrombolytic drug.
