Thrombosis of the internal carotid artery is a rare complication of soft palate injury, only 16 cases having been previously documented. We present the case of a 5 1/2 year-old-boy who sustained an apparently trivial laceration to the right aspect of the soft palate. However, 48 hours after injury, a right cerebral infarct occurred with subsequent left hemiparesis. On supportive and rehabilitative management he made a good recovery over a period of one year.
