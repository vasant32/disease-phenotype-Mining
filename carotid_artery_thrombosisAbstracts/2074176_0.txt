Intraluminal clot of the internal cervical carotid artery is commonly thought to require emergency surgery: 7 intraluminal clots specially threatening (6 of whom had a long defect--15 mm and more) are demonstrated by intraarterial digital angiography--4 patients experienced mild stroke, 3 major stroke. 3 of whom had previous recurrent T.I.A. (3 transient blindness, 1 hemispheric TIA). Carotid angiography identified 3 severe atherosclerotic stenosis, 3 ulcerated plaques and 1 dissection. One patient with coma carus died quickly. Anticoagulation therapy (6 cases) was made, 4 weeks along, without neurologic complications. Follow-up angiograms showed total resolution (4 cases), partial lysis (1 case) and mild extension (1 case). Delayed endarterectomy was made only for severe carotid atherosclerosis (5 cases). In our experience, intraluminal clot of the carotid artery may not be a surgical emergency but require anticoagulant therapy and delayed surgery if major underlying lesions.
