Forty-eight hours after undergoing a successful right carotid endarectomy a patient complained of headache in and behind the right eye radiating to the temple and forehead. The onset of headache was sudden, and the pain was severe and throbbing. After three weeks of regular four- to eight-hour attacks each day the headaches gradually became less frequent. Two months after operation they had disappeared completely. Headache as a complication of endarterectomy is rare, but typically it is vascular and subsides spontaneously in one to six months. If a predisposition to migraine were a precipitating factor many more cases would be expected. No possible explanation for for headache after carotid prearterectomy can account adequately for its apparent rarity.
