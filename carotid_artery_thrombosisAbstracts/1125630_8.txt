The results of angiographic investigation of 211 patients suffering from transient cerebral ischaemic attacks in the carotid territory have been reviewed. The greatest proportion of patients with carotid stenosis and who were referred for endarterectomy were those with a neck bruit ipsilateral to the affected hemisphere. Ocular involvement (amaurosis fugax) was associated with a still higher prevalence of angiographic abnormality, and carotid occlusion was commonest in this group. The implications for the management of patients with transient ischaemic attacks are discussed.
