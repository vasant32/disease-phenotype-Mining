A case of internal carotid artery thrombosis with cerebral infarction occurring in a patient with a massive hand injury is presented. In this case it can be postulated that the mechanism of injury was that of traction of the carotid during the patient's attempts at release of an immobilized extremity. Although the diagnosis of such an injury is difficult, the knowledge that such injuries occur and a suspicion of the examining physician at the time of the initial examination may help avoid such problems in the future.
