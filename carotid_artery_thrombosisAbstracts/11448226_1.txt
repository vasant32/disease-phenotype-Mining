A series of 2-oxopiperazine derivatives, possessing basic moieties at the 3- and the 4-positions, were synthesized and evaluated for their abilities to inhibit platelet aggregation and for their effects on bleeding time. Among the compounds, 2-[(3S)-4-[2-[(4-guanidinobenzoyl)amino]acetyl]-3-[3-[(4-guanidinobenzoyl)amino]propyl]-2-oxopiperazinyl]acetic acid (12c) showed a potent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation and good dissociation between the efficacy and the bleeding side effect. Intravenous infusion of compound 12c at 1.6 microg/mL/min completely prevented arterial thrombus formation induced by endothelial injury in guinea pigs. The dose of 12c that prolonged the bleeding time to three times the control value was 5.8 microg/mL/min. These results suggest that compound 12c might be useful in the clinical treatment of thrombotic diseases, and we selected 12c (TAK-024) as a candidate for the clinical trials.
