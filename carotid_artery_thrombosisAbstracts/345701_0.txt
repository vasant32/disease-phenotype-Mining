The action of 2 topic agents on the thrombosis of the carotid artery after microsuture was studied in rats. These drugs were magnesium sulfate whose antithrombotic effect has been demonstrated in vitro, and Ringer lactate considered inactive on coagulation. Twenty-two randomized rats underwent an end-to-end microsuture of the primitive carotid artery, the solutions being used to wash the lumen of the vessel and to irrigate the operative field. Arterial patency was controlled after one hour and after 10 days. No statistically significant difference was found between the two series.
