In order to investigate whether the increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR during carotid endarterectomy are due to a systemic, sympathicotonic stress response and to compare two anesthetic regimens for this operation, 20 patients were randomly allocated to the following groups: (1) modified neuroleptanesthesia with midazolam, fentanyl, and vecuronium: and (2) isoflurane anesthesia with vecuronium relaxation. Premedication (pethidine, promethazine) and induction of anesthesia were similar in both groups. The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine (by HPLC/ECD), ADH, ACTH, and cortisol (by RIA), glucose, lactate, and free glycerol were determined before and after induction of anesthesia, 7 times during the operation, and 30 min after extubation. MAP and HR were measured continuously. Statistical evaluation was undertaken by analysis of variance with repeated measures on 1 factor, considering P values of less than 0.05 as significant. The endocrine parameters failed to show any remarkable increase during the entire operation period. After the end of the operation all hormones rose significantly (P less than 0.001). No correlation was found between plasma catecholamines and increases in MAP and HR. Group levels of norepinephrine and ADH were higher in the isoflurane group (P less than 0.04). It is concluded that cardiovascular reactions during carotid endarterectomy are not caused by systemic stress. Neuroleptanesthesia leads to better stress protection in the postoperative period, while isoflurane anesthesia has some advantages for the intraoperative control of arterial pressure.
