 PURPOSE: After carotid endarterectomy, intraoperative findings and outcome of immediate reoperation of patients who had an intraoperative stroke were compared with those of patients who had an early postoperative stroke. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 2250 carotid endarterectomies performed between 1980 and 1997. Intraoperative stroke (group A) was detected after 41 of the 2250 operations (1.8%), whereas early postoperative stroke (group B) developed after 18 of the 2250 operations (0.8%). Patients from both groups were reoperated on within 1 hour after neurological examination. RESULTS: Positive intraoperative findings that could be corrected during immediate reoperation were: (1) thrombotic occlusion of the carotid artery that was operated on caused by technical error, which was found in nine of 41 patients (22%) in group A and in 11 of 18 patients (61%) in group B (P =.009); (2) mural thrombus caused by technical error without occlusion, which was detected in seven of 41 patients (17%) in group A and in two of 18 patients (11%) in group B (P >.05); and (3) technical error without a thrombus, which was found in eight of 41 patients (20%) in group A and in three of 18 patients (17%) in group B (P >.05). A patent carotid artery was found in 17 of 41 patients (42%) in group A and in two of 18 patients (11%) in group B (P =.046). Twenty of the 41 patients (49%) in group A died, and four of 18 patients (22%) in group B died (P > 0.05). Major neurological deficit remained in nine of 41 patients (22%) in group A and four of 18 patients (22%) in group B (P > 0.05). Total recovery occurred in seven of 41 patients (17%) in group A and in eight of 18 patients (45%) in group B (P = 0.058). CONCLUSION: Carotid artery thrombosis during immediate reoperation was more frequent in patients who had an early postoperative stroke than in patients who had an intraoperative stroke. It appears that patients who had an intraoperative stroke have a higher incidence of uncorrectable lesions.
