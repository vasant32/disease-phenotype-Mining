Thrombus formation in the rabbit carotid artery has been studied kinetically in vivo using a minimally invasive technique utilising radioisotopes. Clamping of the carotid artery for 5 min resulted in the simultaneous accumulation of platelets and fibrin at the site of injury over the next 45 min. Under the electron microscope the response was seen to range from platelet monolayer adhesion to mural thrombus formation with fibrin deposition. In animals rendered thrombocytopenic, fibrin deposition was impaired during the first 15-20 minutes after injury. Basic coagulation times and fibrinogen concentration were within normal limits. In addition the injured vessels in these animals accumulated more radiolabelled albumin, but not erythrocytes, than injured vessels in control animals. The results may imply a role for platelets in the enhancement of fibrin deposition during the early part of the response to injury and in contributing to the maintenance of normal permeability following vessel injury.
