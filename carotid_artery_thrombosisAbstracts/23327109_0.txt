There is an ongoing effort to develop better methods for noninvasive detection and characterization of thrombus. Here we describe the synthesis and evaluation of three new fibrin-targeted PET probes (FBP1, FBP2, FBP3). Three fibrin-specific peptides were conjugated as DOTA-monoamides at the C- and N- termini, and chelated with 64CuCl2. Probes were prepared with a specific activity ranging from 10 - 130 ÂµCi/nmol. Both the peptides and the probes exhibited nanomolar dissociation constants (Kd) for the soluble fibrin fragment DD(E), although the Cu-DOTA derivatization resulted in a 2-3 fold loss in affinity relative to the parent peptide. Biodistribution and imaging studies were performed in a rat model of carotid artery thrombosis. For FBP1 and FBP2 at 120 min post injection, the vessel containing thrombus showed the highest concentration of radioactivity after the excretory organs liver and kidneys. This was confirmed ex vivo by autoradiography which showed > 4-fold activity in the thrombus containing artery compared to the contralateral artery. FBP3 showed much lower thrombus uptake and the difference was traced to greater metabolism of this probe. Hybrid MR-PET imaging with FBP1 or FBP2 confirmed that these probes were effective for detection of arterial thrombus in this rat model. Thrombus was visible on PET images as a region of high activity that corresponded to a region of arterial occlusion identified by simultaneous MR angiography. FBP1 and FBP2 represent promising new probes for the molecular imaging of thrombus.
