This study examined the microglial reaction in a simulated thrombo-embolus ischaemia in rats given an intracarotid injection of a suspension of homologous blood clot. All rats including the controls receiving vehicle injection were perfused at 5 hours, and 1, 3 and 7 days post-operation. The brains were removed and processed for immunohistochemistry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies: OX-42, OX-18 and OX-6 for labeling of microglia. In rats given saline injection OX-42 immunoreactive microglial cells were observed to be distributed quite evenly throughout the whole brain. When injection of clot suspension was given, microglial cells responded vigorously, particularly in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Microglial reaction was also detected in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex, caudate as well as septal nuclei. The majority of the detected reactive microglial cells were hypertrophied showing thick or stout processes. Some rod-like and amoeboid microglia were also observed. Rarely did the reactive microglia express OX-6 immunoreactivity. All microglial cells were unreactive for OX-18. The actual mechanisms leading to the microglial activation as well as functions of reactive microglia in focal cerebral ischaemia remain speculative. In the absence of direct evidence, it could only be suggested that they may act as sensor cells for detection of subtle alterations in the microenvironment, probably in response to focal ischaemia and/or leakage of serum-derived factors induced by thrombo-embolus stroke.
