Late (up to 15 years) results of surgical and conservative treatment were compared in patients with stenosis or occlusion of the extracranial brain-supplying arteries. The results of surgical treatment were better in patients with transient brain ischaemia as well as in those with completed stroke. In the surgically treated group the per cent of patients improved was greater (especially in cases with transient ischaemia), the survival time was longer, and the number of deaths caused by cerebral diseases was lower.
