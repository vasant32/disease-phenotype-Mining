Fatal traumatic thrombosis of the left internal carotid artery occurred in a 38-year-old man following minor blunt cervical trauma during an altercation. There was no external injury observed on the head, face, or neck. Neurologic deficit developed soon after the injury, which progressed to right hemiplegia. His condition deteriorated and he expired on the sixth hospital day. The gross and microscopic findings of the internal carotid artery are presented and the significance of minor cervical blunt trauma and the possible mechanism for the vascular lesion are discussed.
