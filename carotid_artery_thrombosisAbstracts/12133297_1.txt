OBJECTIVE: To assess the embolic effects and biocompatibility of Eudragit mixture, a new liquid embolic agent. METHODS: In vitro, the viscosity and precipitation time of Eudragit mixtures at several concentrations were measured to study the best proportion of components of the mixture. In vivo, a branch of the right external carotid artery was embolized with Eudragit mixture in 12 rabbits, and with n-butyl cyanoacrylate in another 12 rabbits for a comparative study of the general, angiographic and histopathologic changes between the two groups. RESULTS: Eudragit mixture containing 7.5 g Eudragit, 50 ml absolute ethanol and 50 ml iopromide was shown in vitro to have good properties including rapid precipitation and soft elastic sponge formation upon contact with blood; in vivo, to be nontoxic, nonadherent to the microcatheter and able to embolize the vascular lumen completely without later recanalisation. CONCLUSION: Eudragit mixture is an effective, nontoxic, safe and promising liquid embolic agent.
