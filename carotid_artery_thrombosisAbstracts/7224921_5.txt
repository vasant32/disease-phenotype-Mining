Ectopic origin of the ophthalmic artery from the middle meningeal artery was found in a patient with amaurosis fugax. The origin of the external carotid artery on the symptomatic side was markedly stenotic. The patient's symptoms disappeared after external carotid endarterectomy. We review the ectopic sites of the ophthalmic artery and discuss atheromatous disease of the external carotid system as a cause of transient ischemic attacks.
