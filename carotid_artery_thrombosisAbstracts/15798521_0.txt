INTRODUCTION: Mucormycosis is a rare and acute fungal infection which is frequently lethal. The rhinocerebral form is usually seen in diabetics, but other localizations may occur in severely immunocompromised subjects. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a sphenoidal sinusitis associated with a probable cavernous sinus thrombosis and carotid artery thrombosis with middle cerebral artery territory infarction. Diagnosis was made on histological examination following sphenoidotomy. Early medical and surgical treatment led to a good outcome. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of rhinocerebral mucormycosis should be considered in the clinical setting of necrotic sinusitis and acute neurologic deficit in diabetic patients. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial factors leading to a good outcome.
