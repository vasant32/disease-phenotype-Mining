Sixty-six patients (72 carotid arteries) were examined after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) using Doppler colour flow imaging (DCFI). Examinations were performed 4-18 days (mean: 7 days) after surgery (32 patients, 34 arteries) or between 2 and 100 months (mean: 39 months) after CEA (34 patients, 38 arteries). Minor vessel wall abnormalities were found in 36% in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and in 55% in the common carotid artery (CCA) or bifurcation. One patient had a minor residual ICA stenosis after surgery; two low-grade stenoses and three ICA-occlusions were diagnosed at follow-up. Altered flow patterns occurred most in CCA (90%) and were predominantly located adjacent to the vessel wall and in dilated vascular segments of the CCA. Disturbed haemodynamics in the ICA were less marked (57%) and frequently found in the central vessel lumen or diffusely distributed. We conclude that surgically induced changes of the vessel geometry and residual or recurrent vascular wall abnormalities are often associated with distinct haemodynamic disturbances, which can reliably be detected by DCFI.
