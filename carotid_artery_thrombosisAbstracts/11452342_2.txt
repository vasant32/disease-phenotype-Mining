The use of patch angioplasty after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to have superior results to CEA with primary closure. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patches have been shown to have comparable results to autogenous vein patching; however, PTFE has the disadvantage of prolonged hemostasis time. Therefore, many surgeons are using collagen-impregnated Dacron patches (Hemashield[HP]). We believe this is the first prospective controlled study of the use of HP in carotid endarterectomy. This study included 144 consecutive patients who had 151 CEAs with HP. Postoperative duplex ultrasounds were done at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter. The mean follow-up was 12 months (range: 1-30 months). Indications for CEA included symptomatic (64%) and asymptomatic (36%) stenoses. The overall incidence of ipsilateral stroke was 5% (4% perioperative), with a combined TIA and stroke rate of 12%. Incidence of > or =50% recurrent stenosis was 21% (7% symptomatic TIA/stroke) and > or =80% recurrent stenosis was 9%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that at 1 year and 2.5 years freedom from > or =50% recurrent stenosis was 78% and 57%, respectively, freedom from > or =80% recurrent stenosis was 92% and 77%, respectively, and a stroke-free survival rate of 94% and 72%, respectively. Women had a 22% and men a 14% recurrent stenosis rate (p=0.04). There was no correlation between other specific risk factors and recurrent stenosis except for hypertension (33% vs 12%, p=0.003). The authors concluded that CEA with HP had a higher incidence of recurrent stenosis (21%), and a higher perioperative stroke rate (4%) after a mean follow-up of 12 months than previously reported using PTFE or saphenous vein patching (2% and 9% recurrent stenosis rates, respectively, and 1% and 0% perioperative stroke rates, respectively after a mean follow-up of 30 months). This raises the question as to whether this patch is thrombogenic in this location. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial comparing this patch with other patches (PTFE or vein) is warranted.
