Thirty-eight patients with amaurosis fugax were examined ophthalmologically. In 12 of these cases carotid occlusion was diagnosed by ophthalmodynamography and Doppler ultrasonography of the orbital vessels. Angiographic substantiation was possible in nine of these patients. The pathognomonic importance of amaurosis fugax for occlusive carotid disease is clearly shown by these findings. The plasma concentration of platelet specific proteins was examined in 32 patients and found to be pathologically increased in 13 cases. Spontaneous aggregation of platelets and circulating platelet aggregates were only found in a few patients. Due to the lack of coincidence between the event of amaurosis fugax and the time when platelet function tests were made no definite conclusions may be drawn from these results. Yet disturbances of platelet function must be taken into consideration in the pathogenesis of amaurosis fugax.
