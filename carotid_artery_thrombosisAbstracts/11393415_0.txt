A 48 years-old Japanese man suffered from marked xanthomas on ankles, knees, hand fingers, and foot joints due to insufficient control of serum hypercholesterolemia despite low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) absorptive therapy followed by treatment with potent anti-hypercholesterolemic agents. He had undergone surgical resection of xanthoma on the knee, foot and hand finger joints. Treatment with simvastatin returned the serum total cholesterol levels to nearly normal levels, followed by marked fluctuations. He subsequently experienced transient right-visual disturbance, and roentogenographic examination was performed. The patient was diagnosed as right-common carotid artery thrombosis. After the thrombotectomy of the right-common carotid artery, his visual power was markedly improved.
