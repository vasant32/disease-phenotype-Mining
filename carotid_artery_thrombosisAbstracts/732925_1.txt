Percutaneous measurements by Doppler ultrasound techniques over the supratrochlear, supraorbital and common carotid arteries may detect the presence of a stenosis in the internal carotid artery between the bifurction and the branching of ophthalmic artery. Out of 200 patients examined by Doppler ultrasound 60 patients underwent carotid angiography and the angiographic data were compared with the noninvasive results. The diagnostic accuracy was 85% in cases with stenoses greater than 50% and occlusions; in cases with stenoses of greater than 50% it was 78%. Occlusions could always be verified. Doppler ultrasound is very valuable for follow-up examinations after reconstructive procedures of the internal carotid artery. In 30 patients we were able to objectively document the normalisation of circulation in successfully operated cases by pre- and post-operative examinations.
