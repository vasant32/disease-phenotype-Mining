OBJECTIVE: To differentiate between gaseous and particular microemboli in carotid surgery one clinical approach is the interpretation of the effective sample volume length (SVL). We investigated whether such a clinical interpretation is based on reproducible measurements. METHODS: Microembolic signals (MES) recorded during carotid endarterectomy by a bigated transcranial Doppler device were analyzed off-line. In the two sample volumes, the duration and the velocity of the MES were measured by two observers independently from each other twice within 2 weeks. The SVL of the MES were calculated by multiplying duration with velocity. RESULTS: In the anatomical proximal sample volume 215 MES were recorded of which 203 (94.5%) were also present in the distal. The SVL medians of the MES were 2.2-4.1 mm lower in the distal than in the proximal sample volume as a result of lower velocity and shorter duration of the MES in the distal sample volume. The median of the paired differences of the SVL was 0.2 mm (interquartile range: 0.0-1.2) in the proximal sample volume and 0.8 mm (0.2-1.8) in the distal sample volume for observer 1, and 0.6 mm (0.4-2.2) and 0.9 mm (0.5-1.6) for observer 2. The median of the paired differences of the SVL between the observers was 1.4 mm (1.2-2.9) in the proximal sample volume and 1.6 mm (1.3-3.0) in the distal. CONCLUSION: The intra- and interobserver agreement on calculating SVL is good. However, the depth of insonation influences some features of embolic signals.
