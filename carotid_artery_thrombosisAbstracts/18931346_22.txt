Tissue factor (TF) initiates coagulation, regulates hemostasis, and plays a critical role in mediating arterial thrombosis. TF is up-regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerosis and arterial injury. To examine the biologic role of VSMC-derived TF, we crossed TF(flox/flox) mice with SM22alphaCre(+/-) mice. TF mRNA and activity were decreased in the aortic media of TF-deficient mice by 96% and 94.8%, respectively. There were no differences in TF activity measured in plasma or concentrated microparticles. TF-deficient mice were generated with the expected frequency, showed no evidence of bleeding or increased mortality, and had similar activated partial thromboplastin and tail vein bleeding times. Thrombus-mediated flow reduction in response to ferric chloride injury of the carotid arteries was significantly attenuated in VSMC-specific TF-deficient. Stable occlusion was seen in 11 of 12 wild-type mice, but in only 6 of 16 VSMC-specific TF-deficient mice (P = .001). These data suggest that VSMC-derived TF is critical in a macrovascular model of arterial thrombosis. This mouse model should be valuable in determining the contribution of VSMC-derived TF in other TF-mediated phenomena, such as restenosis.
