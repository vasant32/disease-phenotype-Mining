A randomized placebo-controlled study has been carried out in 3 Moscow hospitals. A sample included 90 patients who survived hemispheric ischemic stroke caused by pathology in the internal carotid artery 72 h before the treatment. Forty-five patients were given standard (basic) therapy and 45 patients received adjuvant batroxobin intravenously by 1,0 ml (10BU) drops on day 1, 3 and 5 and by 0,5 ml (5BU) drops on day 7 and 9 after admitting in a hospital. Assessment of the patients' state was conducted before the treatment, on day 3, 6 and 15. The European Stroke Scale was used to measure severity of clinical symptoms. The results suggest efficacy of batroxobin the use of which provides rapid good results, especially improvement in movement disorders. The use of this drug is accompanied by defibrinating effect. The drug is well tolerated.
