The case of a 68 year old woman with a sudden onset of visual loss in the left eye is reported. Carotid duplex scanning revealed a 50-75% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, with a floating tail of clot extending into the lumen of the artery. Emergency carotid endarterectomy, removing the plaque with the attached thrombus, was performed.
