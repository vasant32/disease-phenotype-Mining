The authors describe 2 patients with multiple cerebral infarcts and hemorrhagic transformation caused by artery-to-artery emboli. Ulcerated plaques with free-floating thrombus adherent to the plaque were detected at the carotid bifurcation by duplex sonography. No other embolic source could be found. One patient developed an occipital infarction due to carotid emboli passing through a fetal-type posterior communicating artery. Both patients recovered well without recurrence of stroke or transient ischemic attack with antiplatelet treatment only. Follow-up carotid duplex sonography showed disappearance of floating thrombus in 1 patient and consolidation of the lesion in the other.
