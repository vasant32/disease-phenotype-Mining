The natural history of amaurosis fugax with hemodynamically insignificant degrees of internal carotid artery stenosis is uncertain. Seventy-three patients over age 40 who presented with amaurosis fugax without obvious cause and had ipsilateral stenoses of 50% or less with carotid duplex scanning were followed for a mean period of 35.5 months (range 3-110) without surgical intervention. At the initial vascular laboratory duplex evaluation, 35 patients had normal arteries (47.9%), 29 had minor (0-19%) stenoses of the ipsilateral internal carotid arteries (39.7%), and 11 had 20-50% stenosis (15.1%). Four patients with 0-19% stenosis and one patient with 20-50% stenosis experienced a subsequent stroke or permanent ipsilateral blindness. When analyzed by life-table format, stroke, blindness, and early death were more frequent in patients with minor degrees of stenosis than in those with normal arteries. Investigations in all patients with amaurosis fugax should be aimed at identifying whether the symptoms are explained by arteriosclerotic, systemic, collagen, cardiac, hematologic, or ophthalmologic disease. When no other etiology is found, and localized carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis of even modest degrees is identified, an atheroembolic etiology should be considered.
