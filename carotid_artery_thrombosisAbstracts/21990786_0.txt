 OBJECTIVES: Acute, simultaneous, concomitant internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral arteries (MCA) occlusions almost invariably lead to significant neurological disability if left untreated. Endovascular therapy is frequently the method of treatment in such situations but there remains a chance of incomplete recanalization. Successful recanalization of the proximal aspect of the occlusion may allow for endogenous thrombolysis and facilitate further endogenous recanalization of any residual MCA occlusion. METHODS: Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular therapy for tandem extracranial ICA-MCA or contiguous intracranial ICA-MCA occlusions were retrospectively analyzed. Rates of facilitated endogenous recanalization at 24 h (FER(24)) were compared by imaging within the immediate post-intervention 5-24 h period in those with proximal recanalization and in those without. RESULTS: 17 patients were included in the analysis. 12 patients had good initial proximal recanalization but a residual partial or total occlusion of the MCA while five patients failed any recanalization. Seven patients (58.3%) in the first group and none in the second had FER(24) on interval imaging after intervention (p=0.04). The probability of death and disability at discharge was less in patients with FER(24) than those without (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of all patients who present with both ICA and MCA occlusions who are only partially recanalized will undergo facilitated endogenous recanalization within the subsequent 24 h following intervention.
