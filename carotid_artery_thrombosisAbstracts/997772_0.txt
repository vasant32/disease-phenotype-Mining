The incidence of mural thrombosis following three types of experimental intimal injuries at common carotid arteries, was investigated in a series of 12 dogs. Mural thrombosis was obtained at each of the intimal lesions. Moreover, obstructive thrombosis occurred in three instances. Further investigation of thrombi revealed that partial fragmentation occurred when exposed to hydrodynamic forces. These results suggest that mural thrombosis following carotid endarterectomy in humans, is possibly more frequent and significant than it is generally appreciated, thus leading to the consideration of postoperative anticoagulation after endarterectomy, as a means to minimize the incidence of postoperative embolic cerebrovascular accidents.
