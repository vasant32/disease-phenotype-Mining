Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), a non-invasive monitoring technique, has potential for detecting microemboli caused by the extracranial internal carotid artery. Many previous reports have shown that TCD-detected microemboli may be a risk factor for stroke. The main purpose of this study is to verify whether microemboli cease after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). TCD monitoring was performed in 43 cases before and after CEA. TCD monitoring was carried out for an hour at the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of each case using a 2-MHz pulse-wave transcranial Doppler device, and high intensity transient signals were counted as microemboli. Microemboli were detected preoperatively in 10 cases (23.3%). Microemboli were not detected in any case immediately after CEA, in either the subacute stage (from 14 to 21 days after CEA) or in the chronic stage (more than 3 months after CEA). In the acute stage (from 3 to 7 days after CEA), microemboli were detected in three cases (7.0%). The rate of TCD-detected microembolic was always significantly reduced after CEA. TCD monitoring can be helpful in assessing the effect of CEA for prevention of stroke by removing the suspected source of microemboli.
