 PURPOSE: To describe experience with 500 temporary balloon occlusions of the internal carotid artery, with particular emphasis on the techniques and complications. METHODS: Temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery was accomplished endovascularly using various balloon-catheter combinations. These temporary balloon occlusions were combined, when possible, with cerebral blood flow analysis with stable xenon-enhanced CT. RESULTS: Complications related to this procedure occurred in 16 (3.2%) patients. Eight (1.6%) patients had asymptomatic complications. There were 8 who experienced neurologic changes. Six (1.2%) of these were transient; two (0.4%) were permanent. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery, believed helpful in identifying patients at risk of stroke during abrupt carotid artery sacrifice, can be performed with an acceptably low complication rate.
