Argon laser irradiation via a transfemorally introduced catheter successfully vapourized both fresh thrombi and stenosing plaques in the carotid artery of seven cadavers and two patients. Fresh thrombi were recanalized throughout their length, while the arteriosclerotic plaques were partially reduced. No particles larger than 7 micron were demonstrated in the eluant flushing fluid, indicating that peripheral emboli need not be feared with this technique.
