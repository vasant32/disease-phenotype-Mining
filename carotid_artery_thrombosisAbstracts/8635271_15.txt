BACKGROUND: Tissue factor (TF)-dependent activation of the coagulation is important in the pathophysiology of intravascular thrombus formation. We tested the effects of a monoclonal antibody against TF (AP-1) on lysis time induced by tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) and on reocclusion rate in a rabbit model of carotid artery thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Intravascular thrombosis was obtained by placing an external constrictor around carotid arteries with endothelial injury. Carotid blood flow velocity ws measured continuously with a Doppler flow probe. Thirty minutes after thrombus formation, the rabbits received either AP-1 (0.15 mg/kg IV, n=8) or placebo (n=8). All rabbits also received TPA (80 microg/kg bolus plus 8 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) infusion for up to 90 minutes or until reperfusion was achieved) and heparin (200 U/kg IV as a bolus). At reperfusion, TPA was discontinued, and the rabbits were followed for an additional 90 minutes. AP-1 shortened lysis time from 44+/-8 minutes (mean+/-SEM) in control rabbits to 26+/-7 minutes in AP-1 rabbits (P<.01). Reocclusion occurred in all control rabbits in 10+/-3 minutes, whereas it occurred in only two of eight AP-1 treated rabbits in 72 and 55 minutes (P<.01). No changes in prothrombin time and ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to various agonists were observed after AP-1 administration, indicating the absence of systemic effects by this antibody. CONCLUSIONS: TF exposure and activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway play an important role in prolonging lysis time and mediating reocclusion after thrombolysis in this model. AP-1, a monoclonal antibody against TF, might be suitable as adjunctive therapy to TPA.
