On the basis of a survey of the pertinent literature and own experiences the authors discuss briefly the indications and contraindications to surgical treatment of stenosis or occlusion of the extracranial arteries supplying the brain. They stress that reconstructive operations on the extracranial cerebral arteries are primarily of prophylactic importance preventing stroke development, they should be carried out in transient brain ischaemia and imminent stroke, severe completed strokes are not treated in this way. Stenosis of the internal carotid artery lends itself in the first place to this reconstructive operation which should be done possibly early when the artery is not yet completely occluded. The best time for the operation is 3-4 weeks after development of brain symptoms after abating of the acute stage of the disease.
