 PURPOSE: A recent overview indicated that although routine patching is safer than routine primary closure after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), there is no systematic evidence that patch type influences outcome. However, most surgeons still believe that prosthetic patches are probably more thrombogenic than vein patches. This study tested the hypothesis that there was no difference in thrombogenicity between the different patch types. METHODS: A total of 274 patients undergoing 276 CEAs were randomized to either Dacron-patch closure (n = 137) or vein-patch closure (n = 139). All patients with an accessible cranial window were monitored for 3 hours postoperatively with transcranial Doppler scanning (TCD). The number of emboli and rate of embolization were quantified with the requirement for selective dextran therapy to control high rates of postoperative embolization. All patients were assessed postoperatively and again at 30 days by a neurologist, and all patients underwent a duplex examination at 30 days. RESULTS: The 30-day death/any stroke rate was 2.2% for patients in the Dacron-patch group and 3.6% for patients in the vein-patch group (P =.72). Patients in the Dacron-patch group had a higher incidence of postoperative emboli (median, 5; interquartile range, 0-10.5) than patients in the vein-patch group (median, 3; interquartile range, 1-17; P =.028). However, the incidence of detecting more than 50 emboli was virtually identical, and patch type had no effect on the incidence of high-rate, sustained embolization that required dextran therapy (5.3% for Dacron, 3.7% for vein). No patient had a carotid thrombosis at 30 days. CONCLUSION: Sustained, high-rate embolization, previously shown to be highly predictive of progression to carotid thrombosis, appears to be patient dependent, rather than related to patch type.
