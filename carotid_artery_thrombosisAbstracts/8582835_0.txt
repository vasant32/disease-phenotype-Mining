A large atraumatic aneurysm of the common carotid artery is reported that was initially believed clinically to be a malignant tumor of the thyroid. Surgical removal and patch plasty were successful. Subtotal thrombosis of an aneurysm with lack of pulsation may make the diagnosis difficult. In any patient with a rapidly increasing mass in the neck, an aneurysm should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
