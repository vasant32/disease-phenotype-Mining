The authors evaluated the indices of Doppler power frequency spectrum analysis in 106 patients with suspected extracranial carotid occlusive disease. Blackshear, Norrving and Knox indices appeared to be most sensitive for identification of the grade of stenosis of the arteria carotis interna. Sensitivity of ultrasound examination was correlated with angiography. The highest sensitivity (90%), specificity (100%), and overal accuracy (97%) were recorded in the group of hemodynamic significances disturbances of ACI, i.e. high stenoses with occlusions. Calculation of indices of spectral analysis has been performed routinely in all non-invasive ultrasound examinations of carotid arteries by means of Echoflow method.
