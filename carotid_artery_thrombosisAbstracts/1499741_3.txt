Post-endarterectomy platelet deposition may play an important role not only in vessel wall healing, but also in the development of progressive stenosis. Using a canine model, we investigated the effect of endothelial cell seeding on platelet deposition on endarterectomised arteries. Thirteen dogs underwent bilateral carotid intimectomy (5 cm long) and one side was seeded with an average of 2 x 10(6) viable freshly harvested endothelial cells. Blood flow was restored 20 min after seeding. On the contralateral side, a sham-seeding was performed. Deposition of 111indium-labelled autologous platelets was studied with sequential gamma camera images 3-5 h, 1, 2, 3, 4 days and 4 weeks after surgery. Platelet uptake was statistically reduced on the seeded side. Animals were killed at 4 weeks (nine dogs) and 5 weeks (four dogs) after surgery. Seven arteries for each group were found to be occluded. We conclude that endothelial cell seeding on endarterectomised arteries is feasible and reduces platelet uptake. Improvement in the efficiency of seeding and reduction of endothelial cell loss might permit clinical application of this technique.
