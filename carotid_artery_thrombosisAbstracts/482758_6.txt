Two cases of crossed aphasia in right-handed patients are reported. The oral language of these two patients was characterized by a reduction in its lexical and grammatical content. Their written language, however, was a veritable jargon with anosognosia. The jargon aphasia of the first patient consisted mainly of neologisms. The written language of the second patient was slightly less disorganized and corresponded to an asemantic jargon. The existence of this jargon aphasia gives these two observations an exceptional character in relation to other cases of crossed aphasia in right-handed patients. It supplies new information which can be the basis for discussion on the relations between cerebral laterlization of language functions and manual preference.
