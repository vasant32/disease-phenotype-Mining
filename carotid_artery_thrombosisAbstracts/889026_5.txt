Doppler ultrasound and supraorbital photoplethysmography were 95 per cent accurate in identifying or excluding significant carotid obstruction in 156 vessels of seventy-six consecutive patients undergoing arteriography. Plethysmography was more sensitive but less specific than Doppler ultrasound. These technics provide simple, rapid, and accurate detection of significant carotid occlusive disease.
