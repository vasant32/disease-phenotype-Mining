 OBJECTIVE: To observe the pharmaceutical effect of Chinese drugs for activating blood circulation (Xiongshao Capsule, XSC, ) and for activating blood circulation and detoxification (Xiongshao Capsule and Huanglian Capsule, XSHLC, ) in terms of the indices of thrombosis, inflammatory reaction and tissue damage related factors in experimental carotid artery thrombosis rats. METHODS: Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into the sham operation group, the model group, the Simvastatin group (SG), the activating blood circulation (ABC) group, and the activating blood circulation and detoxifying (ABCD) group, with 10 rats in each group. Simvastatin (1.8 mg/kg), XSC (0.135 g/kg) and XSHLC (0.135 g/kg) were administered to Simvastatin, ABC and ABCD group by gastrogavage, and an equal volume of normal saline was given to the sham operation group and the model group. After 2 weeks of successive medication, the rats in the model and all drug therapy groups were made into experimental carotid artery thrombosis model. The serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9), tissue inhibitors to metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), granule membrane protein-140 (GMP-140), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were detected with enzyme-linked immunoassay 24 h later. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the levels of serum GMP-140, hs-CRP, IL-6 and MMP-9 were significantly decreased, and the level of t-PA was significantly increased in the ABC and ABCD group ( P<0.05), while the level of serum hs-CRP in ABCD group decreased significantly compared with that in the ABC group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Chinese drugs both for activating blood circulation and for activating blood circulation and detoxifying have good effects on regulating indices of thrombosis, inflammatory reaction and tissue damage in experimental carotid artery thrombosis rats. The effect of activating blood circulation and detoxifying drugs on regulating the level of serum hs-CRP is superior to that of activating blood circulation drug alone.
