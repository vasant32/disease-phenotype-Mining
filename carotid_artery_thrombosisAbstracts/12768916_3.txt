Disruption of a high risk plaque is known as the primary cause of cardiovascular events. Characterization of arterial wall components has become an essential adjunct in the identification of patients with plaques prone to rupture. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been revealed as one of the noninvasive tools possibly capable of identifying and characterizing high risk atherosclerotic plaque. MRI may facilitate diagnosis, and guide and serially monitor interventional and pharmacological treatment of atherosclerotic disease. In addition, it permits the simultaneous assessment of the anatomy, morphology, and hemodynamics for the study of flow-induced atherogenesis. It possibly will identify asymptomatic patients with subclinical atherosclerosis. This has potential significance for the improvement of strategies in primary and secondary prevention.
