Aortic regurgitation due to nonpenetrating trauma of the chest is an extremely rare disease and only 12 cases have been reported in this country. We report a case we treated and present additional of retrospective discussions. The patient was a 59-year-old man who lost consciousness due to a heavy blow to the chest during work. He was diagnosed as having acute aortic regurgitation. A close examination on the 3rd day after the injury revealed cerebral embolism and heart failure could not be controlled by physical treatment. Surgery was performed on the 5th day after the injury. The aorta was incised under cardiopulmonary bypass to examine aortic valves. Commissures between the RCC and the NCC and between the NCC and the LCC had been torn from the aortic wall and injured and thrombus adhesion was observed in a part of the NCC. After repairing the aortic wall, the valve was replaced by SJM valve. Postoperative course is satisfactory.
