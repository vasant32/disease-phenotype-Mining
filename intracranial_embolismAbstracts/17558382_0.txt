Within a cohort of 606 cases of infective endocarditis, 263 were complicated and 99 embolizing, of them 32 to the central nervous system (CNS). Significant predictors of CNS embolisation were inappropriate therapy (p<0.01) and enterococcal etiology (p<0.01). Mortality in patients with CNS emboli was 65% what was significantly higher than in cases without embolisation - 15% (p<0.01).
