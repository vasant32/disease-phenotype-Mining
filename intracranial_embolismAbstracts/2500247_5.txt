The low osmolar nonionic contrast medium Omnipaque was used in 5,339 consecutive coronary angiographies and serious complications were registered. Myocardial infarction occurred in 4 patients, of whom 2 died, and ventricular fibrillation in 1. Cerebral embolism occurred in 11 patients, all of whom survived. The results are compared with those of previous series of coronary angiography with high osmolar ionic media. It is concluded that use of the nonionic medium Omnipaque resulted in a significant reduction of the frequency of serious complications.
