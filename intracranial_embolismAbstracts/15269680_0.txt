Calcified aortic stenosis (CAS) is an unusual cause of cerebral infarct. The presence of cerebral intra-vascular or intra-parenchymatous calcifications, symptomatic or not, is suggestive of the diagnosis of CAS. We report two patients who experienced stroke induced by spontaneous calcic emboli from a calcified aortic valve and underline the importance of brain CT scan.
