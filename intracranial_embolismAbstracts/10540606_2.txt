Simultaneous monitoring of emboli in extracranial and intracranial arteries recorded with identical probes, in a patient with an artificial cardiac valve, allowed the identification and characterization of pairs of signals, which most likely represent single emboli flowing through the common carotid artery into the middle cerebral artery. This technique offers new insight into emboligenesis with obvious therapeutic implications.
