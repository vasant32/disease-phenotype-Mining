The clinical presentation, diagnostic and radiological aspects and the probable aetiology in 20 consecutively studied patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are described. In this retrospective analysis patients were evaluated extensively according to a stroke investigative protocol. Computed tomography signs for CVT may be identified in the majority of cases and frequently obviate the need for angiography. In those patients in whom no satisfactory precipitating factor was recognised further haematological tests revealed abnormalities that are known causes of thrombosis in 7 patients. Eighty-five per cent of the patients made an excellent recovery. It is concluded that CVT can often be diagnosed non-invasively, the presumptive cause can be found in the majority of patients and the prognosis is excellent.
