BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac surgery carries a high risk of neurological complications; therefore, these patients would be an appropriate target population for neuroprotective strategies. In this study, we evaluated postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as a potential surrogate marker for brain embolism and its relationship to neurobiochemical markers of brain injury. METHODS: Of a total of 45 consecutive patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, 37 completed preoperative and postoperative MRI. At the time of the MRI studies, serum S100beta and neuron-specific enolase concentrations were determined. Preexisting T2 and postoperative DWI lesion volumes were quantified. All patients had a blinded neurological examination before and after operation. RESULTS: New perioperative DWI lesions were present in 14 patients (38%), of whom only 3 developed focal neurological deficits. Eighteen small lesions were found in the white matter or vascular border zones in all but 2 patients with territorial stroke. The appearance of new DWI lesions correlated with age, pre-existing T2 lesion volume, and postoperative S100beta concentrations on days 2 to 4 after surgery. In a forward stepwise canonical discrimination model, only T2 lesion volume was selected as a relevant variable. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative DWI lesions in aortic valve replacement is high, and a suitable marker for neuroprotective trials would be a reduction in the number of such lesions. The volume of preexisting T2 lesions is related to the development of perioperative DWI lesions.
