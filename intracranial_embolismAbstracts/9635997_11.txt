OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between coffee consumption and the development of stroke in men at high risk for cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Coffee intake was observed from 1965 to 1968 in a cohort of men enrolled in the Honolulu Heart Program with follow-up for incident stroke over a 25-year period. Subjects were 499 hypertensive men (having systolic or diastolic blood pressures at or above 140 and 90 mm Hg, respectively) in older middle-age (55 to 68 years) when follow-up began. Past and current cigarette smokers were excluded from follow-up. RESULTS: In the course of follow-up, 76 men developed a stroke. After age-adjustment, risk of thromboembolic stroke increased significantly with increases in coffee consumption (P = 0.002). No relationships were observed with hemorrhagic stroke. When adjusted for other factors, the risk of thromboembolic stroke was more than doubled for men who consumed three cups of coffee per day as compared to nondrinkers of coffee (RR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.2-3.7). CONCLUSIONS: Although in need of further confirmation, consumption of coffee appears to be positively associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic stroke in hypertensive men in older middle-age. Findings suggest that it may be prudent to advise older middle-aged men with hypertension who consume large amounts of coffee to consider reducing their coffee intake.
