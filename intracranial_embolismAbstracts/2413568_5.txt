Neurologic complications continue to plague aortocoronary bypass operations. All patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass procedures over a four-year period at the Upstate Medical Center were reviewed. Eight of 893 patients sustained a cerebrovascular accident following operation (0.9%). In 5 patients, the etiology was felt to be calcific and atherosclerotic debris from the ascending aorta. Air embolism occurred in one patient, and the etiology was unknown in 2 patients. Various methods to deal with the diffusely atherosclerotic aorta are discussed.
