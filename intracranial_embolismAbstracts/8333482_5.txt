We describe a case in which twin-twin transfusion with fetal death of the donor at 23 weeks was complicated by suspected intracranial embolic insult of the surviving recipient twin. Dynamic transient intracranial ultrasonographic findings were noted with complete resolution by 28 weeks. Subsequent severe microcephaly of the survivor with no further growth of any of the cranial parameters beyond 25 weeks was thought to be a result of this very unusual pathophysiologic mechanism.
