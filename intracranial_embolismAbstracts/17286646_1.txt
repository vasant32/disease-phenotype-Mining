BACKGROUND: Interatrial block (IAB; P wave > or = 110 ms) is highly prevalent and is strongly associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias and left atrial dysfunction, making it a potential embolic risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 293 neurological admissions over 2 years, 85 patients were diagnosed with embolic strokes and 208 with nonembolic strokes. Patients were then matched for stroke risk factors and evaluated for IAB. Eighty-eight percent of probable embolic stroke patients showed sinus rhythm, demonstrating a 61% IAB prevalence. Only hypertension (P < 0.001; r = 0.3) and IAB (P < 0.006; r = 0.2) were significant and directly correlated. CONCLUSION: IAB could indeed be a novel risk for embolic strokes and further investigation is warranted.
