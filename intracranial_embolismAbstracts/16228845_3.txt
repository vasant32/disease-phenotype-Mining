In patients with an occluded internal carotid artery, the carotid stump syndrome is a potential source of microemboli that pass through the ipsilateral external carotid artery and the ophthalmic artery to the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Thus, the syndrome is associated with carotid territory symptoms although the internal carotid artery is occluded. Surgical exclusion of the internal carotid artery associated with endarterectomy of the external carotid artery has been described as the gold standard of treatment by many authors. This report is the second case, to our knowledge, of endovascular treatment of the carotid stump syndrome with the use of a stent-graft.
