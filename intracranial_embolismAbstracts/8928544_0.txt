Mitral atresia is an extremely rare congenital anomaly in which survival into adulthood is an exception. Without treatment most patients with this anomaly will die in early childhood and only few reach adolescence or early adulthood. The here described patient with mitral atresia, atrial septal defect, single ventricle and transposition of the great arteries survived to age 24 years. She died as consequence of massive cerebral embolism of a thrombus in her left atrium.
