Medical elimination/reduction of a more or less acute functional disorder may be something considerably different from restoration to good health, or the ability to lead an independent life. The form this discrepancy may take; what it can mean to the patient, not least in terms of time consumed; which possibilities there are in view of a new beginning, a re-orientation; which ways and means there exist on the part of the patient as on that of the therapeutic personnel involved, or in the light of the legislative provisions; which role is played by society through the employer; how difficult it is to give a prognosis; these are the issues the authors intend to illustrate by describing the rehabilitation process a young woman of 26 years of age underwent following successful re-canalization of a previously thrombosed basilar artery by urokinetic fibrinolysis. It is also underlined that any rehabilitative measure taken should be oriented towards attainable goals, and be based on consultation (but not necessarily general agreement) among the rehabilitative team. This approach will help the patient comprehend the purpose of the measures taken, and serve to prevent hard feelings that may develop.
