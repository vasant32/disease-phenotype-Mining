This paper presents the results of intraoperative median nerve SEP monitoring in 205 successive patients undergoing isolated carotid endarterectomy (CE) (N = 172) or CE followed by coronary bypass (CBP) and/or vascular replacement (VR) (N = 33). The left and right median nerves were alternately stimulated and recordings performed on 4 channels: cervical, ipsi- and contralateral parietal, and frontal. SEPs were qualitatively rated in terms of mild, moderate, or severe ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral abnormalities. The SEP abnormalities were subdivided into 5 categories as a function of their relationships with intraoperative events: no alterations (67.3%), early or late SEP alterations after carotid cross-clamping (15.6%), SEP alterations after a drop in blood pressure (occurring outside of or within the cross-clamping period) (15.1%), SEP alterations of a most likely embolic origin (2.4%), SEP changes after head positioning (1%), and SEP changes after a modification of the anesthetic regimen (1.5%). Only moderate to severe SEP alterations occurring soon after carotid cross-clamping justified shunt installation in 16% of the cases. SEP alterations after a drop in blood pressure were reversed merely by restoring blood pressure. The neurological outcome was uneventful in 94.2% of cases. Of the 12 patients who developed neurological sequellae, only one case presented transient sequellae after isolated CE without SEP changes while most cases either had undergone combined CE and CBP and/or VR (6 cases) or had presented SEP alterations of embolic origin (3 cases). We conclude that our system of qualitative rating of SEPs proved very sensitive to intraoperative hemodynamic disturbances or macroembolisms.
