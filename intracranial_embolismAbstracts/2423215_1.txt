A 61-year-old woman presented with a superior papillary branch artery obstruction occurring secondary to an intra-arterial embolus. Thirteen months later she developed neovascularization of the optic disc and retina in the same eye. Although the situation is unusual, this case suggests that retinal branch artery obstruction may rarely predispose to ocular neovascularization.
