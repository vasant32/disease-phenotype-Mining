Effects of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthase inhibitors (CV-4151 and ozagrel) on cerebral thrombosis and cerebral damage were examined in a rat middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombosis model and their potencies were compared with the conventional antithrombotic agents, aspirin and ticlopidine. CV-4151 significantly inhibited photochemically induced MCA thrombosis by oral (1 and 10 mg/kg) and intravenous (1 mg/kg) administration. Ozagrel (10 mg/kg, p.o.) also inhibited it. The potency of CV-4151 was about 10 times stronger than that of ozagrel, being comparable with the inhibition of blood TXA2 generation. Aspirin (100 mg/kg, p.o.) and ticlopidine (300 mg/kg, p.o.) showed an inhibitory tendency on MCA thrombosis. Twenty-four h after photochemical stimulation, cerebral edema and cerebral infarction were observed, and the lactate content in the brain increased. CV-4151 and ozagrel prevented this edema, and the antiedema effects of the drugs were correlated with the antithrombotic effect on thrombotic MCA occlusion. CV-4151 (10 mg/kg, p.o.), furthermore, significantly reduced the infarct size and inhibited the increase in lactate content. These results indicate that TXA2 synthase inhibitors inhibit cerebral damage by inhibition of MCA occlusion with thrombosis, probably resulting from the inhibition of TXA2 generation, and their effects are superior to those of aspirin and ticlopidine. TXA2 might play an important role in cerebral damage in the MCA thrombosis model. CV-4151 might be a useful drug for the treatment of cerebral thrombosis and for the prevention of cerebral infarction.
