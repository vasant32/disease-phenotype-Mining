This article describes the clinical application of the 80-lens optical camera in the diagnosis of cerebral infarction, subdural hematoma, intracranial tumor, and hydrocephalus. The 80-lens camera is a simple noncomputerized addition to the Anger scintillation camera that permits an estimation of the cerebral blood flow. The study is noninvasive and quick, minimizing the effect of movement artifact and showing areas of either increased or decreased blood flow. Abnormal tumor vessels appear, and subdural hematomas show brain displacement away from the skull edge. Interpretation of blood flow pattern is not affected by scalp or skull trauma, eliminating a source of error incurred with static scans.
