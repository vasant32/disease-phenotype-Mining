Stroke and myocardial infarction are not commonly seen in children; the occurrence of both conditions in the same well child is unusual. Undifferentiated cardiac tumors are rarely encountered in the pediatric population. We present a case of stroke and myocardial infarction as a consequence of an undifferentiated valvular tumor in a previously healthy child. This case emphasizes the critical importance of serial clinical examinations as part of a complete stroke workup. It suggests the need for additional research on the use of thrombolytic therapy for pediatric cerebral and myocardial infarction and stresses individualization of cardiac tumor treatment plans.
