Two-hundred seventy consecutive patients with "unexplained cerebral ischemia" were studied with transesophageal echocardiography to determine the value of this test in identifying potential cardiac sources of cerebral embolism. The findings of this group were compared with those of 772 consecutive patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation for indications other than cerebral ischemia. This study also examined this group of patients with unexplained cerebral ischemia to determine differences in relation to underlying cardiac rhythm and patient age. Intracardiac thrombus, atrial septal aneurysm, patent foramen ovale, spontaneous left atrial contrast and protruding debris in the thoracic aorta were found more often in patients with unexplained cerebral ischemia. Wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle, as well as mild to moderate valvular lesions including mitral valve prolapse, were found to be similar in both groups. Spontaneous left atrial contrast, as well as mild to moderate valvular abnormalities, were found more often in patients with atrial fibrillation (22% of the group with unexplained cerebral ischemia). However, the presence of intracardiac thrombus was no more frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation than in those with normal sinus rhythm. Patients aged > 50 years were found to have atrial fibrillation and larger left atrial size more often than their younger cohorts, as well as a greater incidence of valvular abnormalities and left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. Mitral valve prolapse was seen more frequently in the younger cohort of patients.
