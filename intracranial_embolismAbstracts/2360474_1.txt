Fifty six patients aged 17 to 45 years who had Ischemic Cerebral Infarction (I.C.I.) were studied. The following etiologies were established: 1. Juvenile atherosclerosis (21 patients); 2. Cerebral embolism either from cardiac (10 patients) and from unknown source (3 patients); 3. Secondary coagulopathies (4 patients); 4. Non atherosclerotic vasculopathies (6 patients); 5. Traumas of skull and neck (3 patients); 6. Migraine (2 patients); 7. Oral contraceptives use (1 patient). In 6 cases the etiology remained unknown. Young subjects with I.C.I. are a heterogeneous group: however in most of them a reasonable cause can be found. The occurrence of acute death (14%) was high, while recurrent stroke (5%) and non acute death (3%) were rare when compared to older patients. At the follow-up 80% had a very little residual motor deficit but only 43% were able to return to previous work.
