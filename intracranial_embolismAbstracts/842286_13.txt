Sixty-four young adults (aged 16 to 40 years) with ischemic stroke were analyzed in retrospect with regard to possible pathogenetic mechanisms. In older patients various predisposing factors emerge (arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia etc.) which are rare among younger age groups. In patients lacking predisposing causes the stroke incidence exhibits a seasonal variation. It is suggested that infection may be important for the development of ischemic stroke.
