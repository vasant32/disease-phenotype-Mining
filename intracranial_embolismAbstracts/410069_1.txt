The characteristic serial CT scan appearance of cerebral infarction created by embolization of the middle cerebral artery in the nonhuman primate (10 baboons) is defined. The earliest CT changes are noted by 12 to 24 hours and include generalized ventricular enlargement and a focal region of decreased absorption in the opercula-basal ganglia region. The area of diminished brain absorption is better circumscribed and of lower attenuation coefficient with increasing chronicity. Distinct hydrocephalus, unilateral exophthalmos and ventricular displacement occurred with increased intracranial pressure. Little additional diagnostic information was obtained via intravenous enhancement and care should be taken as mild enhancement may obscure an area of abnormality.
