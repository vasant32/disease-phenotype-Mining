Assessment of possible cardiac sources of cerebral embolism is a frequent indication for transesophageal echocardiography. We report the case of a patient with a previous left upper pulmonary lobe resection who presented with an ischemic stroke suggestive of cardioembolic origin. A dense spontaneous echo contrast was found in the left upper pulmonary vein stump, which, in the absence of other potential causes of stroke, was considered to be related to the embolic event. We discuss the clinical significance of this finding as a possibly underappreciated source of systemic embolization. Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Ultrasound, 2012.
