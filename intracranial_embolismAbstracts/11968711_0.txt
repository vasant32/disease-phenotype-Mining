Prior selective cerebral perfusion is the method whereby selective cerebral perfusion and systemic perfusion start almost simultaneously, and the arch vessels are clamped. Cerebral circulation is isolated from systemic circulation to avoid cerebral embolization owing to detachment of atherosclerotic material from the aorta, caused by the "sandblasting" effect of high-velocity jets of blood exiting the aortic canula. Twenty-seven consecutive patients underwent total arch replacement for degenerative aortic arch aneurysm using prior selective cerebral perfusion from 1992 to 2001. Surgical death (within 1 month after operation) was 2 cases (7.4%), in-hospital death was 5 cases (18.5%). Systemic circulatory arrest time is almost equal to the time which distal anastomosis takes. The time was 81.4 +/- 24.3 minutes. Selective cerebral perfusion time was 194.9 +/- 30.9 minutes. Extracorporeal circulation time was 280.6 +/- 55.3 minutes. The time for emergence from anesthesia was 6.0 +/- 2.7 hours. Permanent neurologic dysfunction which was thought to occurred within 48 hours after surgery was noted in 1 case (3.7%). Postoperative survival at 8 years was 73.3%. There was 1 arch aneurismal related accident. Prior selective cerebral perfusion may be useful for avoiding cerebral embolization.
