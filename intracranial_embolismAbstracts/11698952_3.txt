Severe atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta is one of the risk factors of dissection of the ascending aorta and cerebral embolism during cardiac operations with cardiopulmonary bypass. Aortic dissection is rare, but once it happens, the mortality rate is high. For the patient with severely atherosclerotic or strongly calcified aorta, we should avoid cannulation into the aorta or clamping of it. In this case, we experienced aortic dissection although we chose the arterial cannulations into the axillary arteries because of the strong calcification of the ascending aorta and the abdominal aorta. The dissection was caused by the cannulation into the axillary artery. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed the dissection during the operation and the ascending aorta was replaced soon. Early diagnosis and treatment saved the patient. This case showed the following points: 1) cannulation into an axillary artery is not always safe; 2) TEE is very useful to detect the complicated dissection during operation; 3) replacement of the ascending aorta alone can be one of the choices for the treatment of aortic dissection caused by cannulation into an axillary artery.
