Five cases of giant thrombosed saccular aneurysms of the cerebral vessels were studied. Three patients had an aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery, one--of the internal carotid artery and one--of the basilar artery. Three patients were operated on. The removal of the aneurysm had a good result in one case, a preoperative neurological defect remained in 2 cases. The clinical picture, diagnosis and the possibilities of surgical intervention in aneurysms of this type are discussed.
