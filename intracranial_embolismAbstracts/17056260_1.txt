Hunter syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis type II, is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting from iduronate sulfatase deficiency. Typical manifestations include short stature, mental retardation, hydrocephalus, macroglossia and cardiac valvulopathy. We describe a 21-year-old patient who presented with acute ischemic stroke and evidence of cerebral embolization. The echocardiogram demonstrated thickened mitral and aortic valves as potential sources of emboli. We conclude that ischemic stroke secondary to cardioembolization is a potential complication of Hunter syndrome.
