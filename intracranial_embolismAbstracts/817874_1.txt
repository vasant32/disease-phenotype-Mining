A syndrome consisting of an apical systolic click and late systolic murmur appeared over a period of three months in a patient with acromegaly. Levels of growth hormone were highest during this interval. As a result of group D streptococcal endocarditis three months later, the patient sustained cerebral embolism and acquired free mitral regurgitation from ruptured chordae tendineae. During follow-up over 18 months, neither the level of growth hormone nor the degree of mitral regurgitation changed significantly.
