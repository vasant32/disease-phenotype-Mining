The densely calcified ascending aorta presents a formidable challenge to the cardiac surgeon. Clamping such an aorta in the patient requiring myocardial revascularization may result in catastrophic cerebral embolism and mar an otherwise successful surgical outcome. Myocardial revascularization using ventricular fibrillation and hypothermia without aortic cross-clamping in 3 patients with severely calcified aortas is described.
