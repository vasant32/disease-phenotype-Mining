Regional changes in adenine nucleotides in the rat brain were studied after 1 h of ischemia produced by the embolization method. The animals were divided into three groups according to neurological symptoms: sham-operation group, group A (hemiparesis only), and group B (hemiparesis with unconsciousness). Marked ATP depletion was detected in the hippocampus on the embolized side and extended to the other regions on the same side in group B. The results suggest that this damage in regional energy metabolism arises from regional reduction in blood flow and/or tissue vulnerability. ATP levels in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum on the opposite side of embolization decreased markedly in group B, and may be caused by extension of brain edema or diaschisis.
