Twenty-nine patients from 28 to 50 years of age with ischemic stroke following a pseudotumorous course were under observation. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those aged from 28 to 40 formed group 1, patients of 41 to 50 years of age formed group 2. Total occlusion of the cerebral vessels in the basin of the internal artery was the morphological substrate responsible for the development of stroke in group 1. In group 2 cerebral infarction was caused by two mechanisms: total obstruction of the cerebral vessels and partial occlusion of the vessel, and chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency.
