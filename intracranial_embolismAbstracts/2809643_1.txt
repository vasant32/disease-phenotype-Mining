In two victims of traffic accidents with broken bones and fat embolism, serial recordings of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were examined to assess brain function. Initial SEPs and BAEPs revealed normal subcortical components, while the late cortical components of SEPs were abolished, findings indicative of diffuse dysfunction of grey rather than of white matter. As the neurological functions became normal, the late components appeared. It is concluded that while absent late components of SEPs do reflect cortical dysfunction, they are not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis. Repetitive recordings of SEPs appear to be a useful tool for assessing the neurological condition and the prognosis of patients with cerebral fat embolism.
