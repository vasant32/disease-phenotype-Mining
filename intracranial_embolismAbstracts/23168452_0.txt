 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preventing cerebral embolisms is a major concern with carotid artery stenting (CAS). This study evaluated 3-dimensional T1-weighted gradient echo (3D T1GRE) sequence to predict cerebral embolism related to CAS. METHODS: We performed quantitative analyses of the characteristics of 47 carotid plaques before CAS by measuring the signal intensity ratio (SIR) and plaque volume using 3D T1GRE images. We used T1-weighted turbo field echo sequence to obtain 3D T1GRE images. We also evaluated diffusion-weighted images (DWI) of the brain before and after CAS to detect ischemic lesions (DWI lesions) from cerebral emboli. RESULTS: SIR (2.17 [interquartile range 1.50-3.07] versus 1.35 [interquartile range 1.08-1.97]; P=0.010) and plaque volume (456 mm(3) [interquartile range 256-696] versus 301 mm(3) [interquartile range 126-433]; P=0.008) were significantly higher in the group of patients positive for DWI lesions (P-group: n=26) than DWI lesion-negative patients (N-group: n=21). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, SIR (P=0.007) and plaque volume (P=0.042) were independent predictors of DWI lesions with CAS. Furthermore, SIR (rs=0.42, P=0.005) and plaque volume (rs=0.36, P=0.012) were positively correlated with the number of DWI lesions. From analysis of a receiver-operating characteristic curve, the most reliable cutoff values of SIR and plaque volume to predict DWI lesions related to CAS were 1.80 and 373 mm(3), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative evaluation of carotid plaques using 3D T1GRE images may be useful in predicting cerebral embolism related to CAS.
