Left ventricular papillary fibroelastomas are associated with a high risk of cerebral embolization. Two-dimensional echocardiography and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography are helpful in diagnosing tumors, planning a surgical approach, and achieving adequate excision. A video-assisted thoracoscope via the left atrium was used to visualize a left ventricular papillary fibroelastoma. Thoracoscopic visualization facilitated excision of a mass within the chordae tendineae between the anterolateral papillary muscle and the left ventricular wall. Video-assisted thoracoscopy greatly facilitates exposure/excision of deeper intracavitary left ventricular masses.
