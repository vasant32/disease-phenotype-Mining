Hemorheology and hemostasis in patients with ischemic stroke in comparison to the process of cerebral embolism are considered. Results of transcranial Doppler monitoring of microembolic signals and indices of coagulation and anticoagulation blood systems are analyzed. The changes of both hemorheology and hemostasis in ischemic disturbances of blood circulation are characterized by an increase of coagulation blood activity and suppression of anti-coagulation activity. In ischemic stroke, as compared to transitory ischemic attacks, the markers of thrombinemia were increased significantly that was most pronounced in cases of lacunar and cardioembolic genesis. Cerebral microembolism was associated with imbalance of hemostasis systems. The results of the study may be used in elaboration of recommendations for optimization of therapeutic arrangements in ischemic disturbances of cerebral blood circulation.
