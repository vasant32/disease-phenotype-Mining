We report 20 cases of right unilateral spatial neglect caused by lesions in the left cerebral hemisphere. Differences in neuropsychological symptoms and lesions sites are discussed in connection with handedness. Of the right-handed patients, 6 had severe aphasia, 4 had Gerstmann's syndrome, and 1 had pure agraphia, but unilateral spatial neglect in these cases disappeared after a number of months. Six of the non-right-handed patients had moderate-to-severe aphasia, while the other 3 cases had no aphasia at all. Eight of the 9 cases in this group continued to have right unilateral spatial neglect for more than 6 months. Lesion site as determined by CT differed as to hemisphere, but all fell into the common area previously mentioned in connection with such disorders: i.e., the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes.
