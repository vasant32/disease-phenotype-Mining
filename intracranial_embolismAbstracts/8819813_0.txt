Bacterial endocarditis in pregnancy shows a low incidence; it is often associated with a prior history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease. In the large part of reports the illness tends to run a subacute course and to recognize a major frequency in the third trimester of pregnancy. We presented the case of a 29 year-old woman with mitral and aortic bacterial endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiography performed one week after spontaneous delivery suggested valve vegetations. Antibiotic therapy turned out to be partially successful, in fact cerebral embolizations subsequently occurred. Conservative surgery appeared to be favourable and the patient shows a satisfactory present clinical state.
