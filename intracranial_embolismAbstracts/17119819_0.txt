OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of spontaneous occlusion of residual malformations that had previously been embolized and to analyze their probable causes. METHOD: Retrospective review of patients with embolized arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) between January 1999 and August 2005 in our institution and analysis of two cases of occlusion in residual AVMs. RESULTS: Two cases of AVMs that received endovascular treatment and had post-embolization residual nidus malformation, which in later angiographic controls showed a complete disappearance of the lesions without other treatment. CONCLUSION: The spontaneous occlusion of residual arteriovenous malformations is an infrequent occurrence. Several related mechanisms are discussed.
