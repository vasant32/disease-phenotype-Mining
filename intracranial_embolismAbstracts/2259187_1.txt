The clinical courses of 214 patients with infective endocarditis treated between 1958 and 1987 at the First Medical Hospital of the University of Kiel (FRG) were analyzed retrospectively. A decrease in the incidence of endocarditis occurred during the 30-year observation period. The mean age of patients was 48 years, and men were more frequently affected than women. In the course of the investigation, a rise in isolated aortic valve disease was noted, whereas the number of patients with isolated involvement of the mitral valve and combined mitral-aortic valvular defects declined. Streptococci (57%) were the most frequent pathogens isolated; as opposed to their increase, the percentages of Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci decreased. Otolaryngological, dentogenic and urogenital diseases were most frequently held to be responsible for the development of infective endocarditis. Prior cardiosurgical interventions became increasingly significant as a cause of the disease. In this connection, a rising percentage of endocarditis cases was linked with prosthetically replaced heart valves. Complications and concomitant symptoms of endocarditis included the development of heart failure, cerebral embolism and encephalitis, splenomegaly, and renal inflammation. Finally, the marked decrease in mortality contrasted with a simultaneous rise in the number of endocarditis cases achieving full recovery.
