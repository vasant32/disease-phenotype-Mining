Fibrin-platelet microembolism in cortical branches distal to stenosis of the middle cerebral artery was directly visualized in a patient with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and was histopathologically confirmed. Cerebral microembolism may produce TIA in patients with stenosis of the middle cerebral artery and may influence the success of the extracranial-intracranial bypass operation in treatment of these patients.
