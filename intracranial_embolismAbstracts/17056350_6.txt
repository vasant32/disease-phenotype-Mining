A 29-year-old woman who had undergone closure of a secundum-type atrial septal defect using the Amplatzer device 2 years previously developed acute and progressive altered mentation. Initial clinical and imaging data confirmed the diagnosis of multiple cerebral, cerebellar and brain stem emboli, and infarcts. She was treated urgently with an intra-arterial thrombolytic agent with only minimal improvement. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a large thrombus attached to the left atrial disc of the atrial septal defect occluder, which was the source of the emboli. In conclusion, this is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of disseminated cerebral emboli and infarctions as a late complication of transcatheter closure of a secundum-type atrial septal defect.
