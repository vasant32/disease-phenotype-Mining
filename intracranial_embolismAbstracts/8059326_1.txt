The authors measured epidural pressure of rats using a microballoon to monitor brain swelling after cerebral embolism. Rats with embolization of the major cerebral artery frequently demonstrated acute brain swelling. Within 5 hours of embolization, the increase in epidural pressure was 29.7 +/- 20.3 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), ranging from 3 to 68 mm Hg. The increase in epidural pressure tended to reach a near-maximal value within 30 minutes of embolization and thereafter stayed at that point until the end of the experiment. These results suggest that measuring epidural pressure can quantitatively assess acute brain swelling in rats.
