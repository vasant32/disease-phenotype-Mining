Deafferentation pain is known usually to be resistant to both narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics. Four cases of this condition are reported here in which benefit was obtained with pizotifen, a 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist. Further controlled clinical studies are required to verify this observation.
