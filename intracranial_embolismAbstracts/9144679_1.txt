The application of Doppler-tipped guide wires to measure blood flow velocity in coronary and peripheral arteries has been described previously as a valuable means of functional assessment in interventional cardiological procedures. In animal studies intravascular Doppler has been used in the cerebrovascular system, and this appears to be an important field of application for this new technique. We used intravascular haemodynamic monitoring by the Doppler guide wire during neuroendovascular procedures in patients with different cerebrovascular diseases and evaluated the clinical feasibility of the method. We found it a safe technique which complements morphological angiographic information with valuable functional data. Further studies may be expected to demonstrate the relation of flow parameters to clinical outcome.
