Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is useful in the assessment of potential cardiac sources of emboli in patients with ischemic stroke and clinical history of heart disease. Aim of our study was to assess the utility of TEE in stroke patients with and without clinical evidence of cardiac disease. In addition, we evaluated if multiplane TEE, versus mono and biplane TEE, provides additional information about potential cardiac sources of emboli. A total of 89 ischemic stroke patients were studied: 30 patients with a history and clinical evidence of cardiac disease (Group A) and 59 patients without evidence of cardiac disease (Group B). All patients had a documented ischemic lesion of the brain. Patients who had an extracardiac potential source of emboli were excluded from the study. In all patients, transthoracic (TTE) and biplane TEE were performed, whereas omniplane TEE was performed in 40 patients only. In Group A, sources of emboli were disclosed by TTE in 33% of the patients. When TEE was performed the percentage of positive cases raised to 83% (p < 0.001). In Group B, TTE was positive in only 10% of the patients as opposed to 43% with TEE (p < 0.001). Omniplane TEE revealed a potential source of emboli in 23 out of 40 (57%) patients versus 16/40 (40%) and 20/40 (50%) with monoplane and biplane, respectively. TEE is useful in patients with cardiovascular disease in whom clinical evaluation and TTE are negative for sources of emboli. TEE is of great value in stroke patients without clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease in whom an extracardiac potential source of emboli has been excluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
