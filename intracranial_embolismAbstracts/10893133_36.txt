PURPOSE: To study the feasibility and safety of carotid angioplasty and stenting using a new cerebral protection device that temporarily occludes the distal internal carotid artery (ICA). METHODS: Forty-eight high-risk patients (39 men, mean age 69.1 +/- 8 years, range 54 to 86) with 53 ICA stenoses underwent percutaneous angioplasty and stenting via the femoral approach under cerebral protection afforded by a 0.014-inch GuardWire balloon occlusion device. Mean stenosis was 82.1% +/- 9.65% (range 70 to 96) and mean lesion length was 16.0 +/- 7.5 mm (range 6 to 50). Thirty-three (62%) lesions were calcified, and 38 (72%) were ulcerated. Thirty-two (60%) of the lesions were asymptomatic. With the occlusion balloon inflated in the distal ICA, the lesion was dilated and stented. The area was cleaned by aspiration and flushed via an aspiration catheter advanced over the wire. Blood samples were collected from the external carotid artery (ECA) and analyzed to measure the size and number of particles collected. Computed tomography and neurological examinations were performed the day after the procedure. RESULTS: Immediate technical success was achieved in all patients with the implantation of 38 Palmaz stents, 8 Expander stents, and 11 Wallstents. Carotid occlusion was well tolerated in all patients but 1 who had multiple, severe carotid lesions and poor collateralization. Mean cerebral flow occlusion time was 346 +/- 153 seconds during predilation and 303 +/- 143 seconds during stent placement. Total mean flow occlusion time was 542 +/- 243 seconds. One immediate neurological complication (transient amaurosis) occurred in a patient who had an anastomosis between the external carotid (EC) and ICA territories. Debris was removed in all patients with a mean 0.8-mm diameter catheter. CONCLUSION: Cerebral protection with the GuardWire device is easy, safe, and effective in protecting the brain from cerebral embolism. Larger studies are warranted.
