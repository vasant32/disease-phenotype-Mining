BACKGROUND: There is interest in expanding ventricular assist device use from short-term bridging to transplantation to long-term and permanent support. METHODS: We have reviewed the outcome of 162 patients who had as mechanical bridge to transplantation that lasted at least 60 days. Eighty-five patients received the HeartMate, 40 the Novacor, and 37 the Thoratec device. RESULTS: Of the 162 patients, 125 received transplants, and 115 survived after transplantation (93%). Within the group there were 174 complications including 54 infections of the driveline, 73 other infections, and thromboembolic strokes in 47. Infections of the driveline were considered major in 24 of 54 cases, and other infections were major in 36 of 73 cases. Twenty-seven of those who sustained thromboembolic events had residual effects. Of 11 patients with a major stroke and infection, only 1 survived transplantation. Eighty-two patients were supported between 60 and 100 days, 63 patients between 101 and 200 days, 12 patients between 201 and 300 days, and only 5 patients in excess of 300 days. A greater percentage of candidates died waiting between 101 and 200 days than between 60 and 100 days (25% versus 10%). The incidence of complications also rose in those patients bridged more than 100 days. CONCLUSIONS: The data reinforce the excellent results obtained in the bridge to transplantation trials that reported a shorter duration of support. For those interested in extended bridge to transplantation or permanent use of the currently available devices, the results suggest reasonable success can be anticipated, but the serious infections and strokes tend to be more common with longer duration of support.
