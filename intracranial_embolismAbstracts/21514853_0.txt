 INTRODUCTION: Aneurysm of the extracranial internal carotid artery (AEICA) is extremely rare catastrophic pathology associated with cerebral embolism and rupture. There was no report on AEICA associated with bullous lung disease. REPORT: We report a case of AECIA in a 44-year-old female patient combined with asymptomatic pulmonary bulla, and successfully treated by autologous carotid artery reconstruction. CONCLUSION: The possibility of a relationship between AEICA and bullous lung disease is discussed about the level of alpha 1-antitrypsin (Î±1-AT). The using of external carotid artery (ECA) replace of the internal carotid artery (ICA) combined with resection of the AEICA is an autologous reconstruction to restore arterial continuity and avoiding the use of synthetic or vein graft with their potential complications.
