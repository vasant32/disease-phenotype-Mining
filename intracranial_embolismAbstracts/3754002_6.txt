Rupture of a mycotic aneurysm often occurs before the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis is made or whilst the patient is being treated with antibiotics. It is recognised that cerebral embolism continues to occur after adequate antibiotic treatment, but the late rupture of a mycotic aneurysm seems to be very unusual. We report such a case where rupture of a peripherally sited aneurysm, demonstrated angiographically and pathologically, occurred 6 months after bacteriologically adequate treatment of streptococcal bacterial endocarditis.
