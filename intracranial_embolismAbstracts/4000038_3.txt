Among 2627 necropsies performed in the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, over a period of 11 years, 16 cases of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) were found in patients with cancer (13 adenocarcinomas). The final stay in hospital of seven of these patients was complicated by a major embolic cerebral (six patients), or spinal cord (one patient), stroke. In all cases, the diagnosis of NBTE was made at necropsy. The aortic valve was affected in 10 patients, the mitral valve in five, and both the mitral and tricuspid valves in one. The diagnosis of NBTE should be considered in any patient with a known, or suspected, malignant neoplasm who suffers a stroke or other unexplained embolic events.
