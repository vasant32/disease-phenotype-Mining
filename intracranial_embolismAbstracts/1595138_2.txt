The standard treatment for cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE) is an initial recompression to 6 atm abs on air for 30 min followed by oxygen breathing at 2.8 and 1.9 atm abs. It has been suggested that initial recompression to 2.8 atm abs on O2 may be as beneficial, thus avoiding potential treatment complications associated with the deeper depth. To test this hypothesis, we measured the recovery of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) following air embolism in anesthetized, ventilated cats. Air was infused into the carotid artery in increments of 0.08 ml until the SEP amplitude was reduced to less than 10% of the baseline value for 15 min. Three groups were studied. A control group (n = 10) received no further treatment after SEP suppression. The second group (6 atm abs/HBO] (n = 8) was compressed to 6 atm abs on air for 30 min followed by O2 breathing at 2.8 atm abs for 100 min. The third group (HBO) (n = 8) was compressed to 2.8 atm abs on O2 for 130 min. The control group recovered 28.8 +/- 18.2% (mean +/- SD) of the baseline amplitude, whereas the 6 atm abs/HBO group recovered 48.6 +/- 22.6%, and the HBO group recovered 62.0 +/- 20.3%. An analysis of variance revealed that only the HBO group had significantly (P less than 0.01) better recovery than the control group. There was no significant difference in SEP recovery between the 2 treatment groups. These results suggest that treating CAGE at 2.8 atm abs with O2 is a viable alternative to the current therapy.
