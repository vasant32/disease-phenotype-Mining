The occurrence of a left ventricular thrombus is a classic complication of acute myocardial infarction. On the contrary, this is much less frequent in the right ventricle. The authors report the case of a patient presenting a biventricular thrombus resulting as a complication of an anterior myocardial infarction, diagnosed by bidimensional ultrasonography. The course is characterized by the occurrence of a cerebral vascular accident. The sonogram following this neurological accident shows that the left ventricular thrombus has disappeared, confirming its migration. On the contrary, the right ventricular thrombus regressed under appropriate heparin treatment, without any embolic complication.
