Twenty rhesus monkeys were used to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) following experimental occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 17 hours. Animals were initially treated after four hours while the MCA remained occluded and a series of tests was used to evaluate the neurological and cerebral status of each monkey for seven days. The results show that the gross, microscopic and angiographical picture of dexamethasone and no-treatment controls was practically identical. In contrast, DMSO-treated monkeys showed significant protection from the severe neurological deficits seen in the other groups. It is concluded that DMSO has a positive effect in reducing the neurological deficits seen in this model and may be potentially useful in clinical emoblic stroke.
