Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common condition but is only rarely associated with embolic complications. We describe a 42-year-old man with recurrent posterior circulatory ischemic strokes that resulted in ataxia and cognitive impairment. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a BAV with mild stenosis, moderate calcification, and a dilated ascending aorta. The degree of calcification and the valve phenotype might be important factors implicating the BAV as a rare cause of ischemic stroke.
