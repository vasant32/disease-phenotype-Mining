Intracardiac blood cysts are thin-walled congenital cysts located in the endocardium and are seen predominantly in infants. They are rare in adults and are typically asymptomatic. However, complications such as valve dysfunction and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction have been reported in adults. We report a 42-year-old woman who developed an embolic stroke in association with intracardiac blood cysts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of intracardiac blood cysts manifesting as an embolic stroke.
