INTRODUCTION: Proinflammatory cytokines are the main responsible for the onset of postischemic inflammatory cascade. Recently, the deleterious effect of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the acute phase of stroke has been described. Animal models suggest a link between both families. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate possible relations between the MMP overproduction and proinflammatory cytokine expression after human ischemic stroke. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From all consecutive stroke patients attended during a 10 months period, we selected and prospectively studied those presenting as a cardioembolic stroke involving the MCA territory. MMP 9, MMP 2 and IL 6 were serially measured by means of ELISA at study entry and at 12, 24 and 48 hours after symptoms onset. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were studied. A positive correlation was found between mean expression of both MMPs and IL 6 (r= 0.33, p= 0.040 for MMP 2 y r= 0.45, p= 0.004 for MMP 9). From all measured timepoints, the best obtained correlation was that of MMP 9 with IL 6 at 24 hours (r= 0.418, p= 0.010). At 24 h a peak value of IL 6 was observed. Baseline MMP 2 and MMP 9 levels showed a trend to correlate with that peak of IL 6 (r= 0.329, p= 0.061 for MMP 2 y r= 0.325, p= 0.061 for MMP 9). CONCLUSION: MMP expression correlates with the inflammatory cascade activation after acute cardioembolic stroke.
