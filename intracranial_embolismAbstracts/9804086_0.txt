We applied a new technique of three-dimensional (3-D) transcranial power Doppler imaging to demonstrate the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in the 2 stroke patients. In the first patient, the 3-D power Doppler study clearly showed the horizontal portion, bifurcation, proximal portion of the upper and lower trunks, and the major branches of the lower trunk of the MCA. In the second patient, the 3-D power Doppler clearly revealed the proximal bifurcation of the left MCA. The 3-D transcranial power Doppler seems to be useful in making clear 3-D images of the MCA.
