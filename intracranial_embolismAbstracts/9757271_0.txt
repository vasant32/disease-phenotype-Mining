We report two cases of posttrauma cerebral fat embolism evaluated with MRI. Due to sensitivity, MRI is the best examination for detecting focal abnormalities of the grey or white matter. MRI helps to make the diagnosis in atypical cases and allows assessment of both extension and course of the embolism.
