OBJECTIVE: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a risk of cerebral embolism. Echocardiographic parameters elevate this risk significantly. However, there is little knowledge about the long-term fate and the rate of clinically silent cerebral embolism under continued oral anticoagulation. The aims of our study were to assess prognosis of patients with AF and determine a high risk group with an increased risk of cerebral embolism under oral anticoagulation. METHODS: Consecutive patients with persistent or permanent AF and left atrial (LA) thrombi, dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) and/or reduced LA appendage peak emptying velocities (LAAv) were included in the study (N = 128). Patients with AF and without echocardiographic risk factors (N = 114) served as controls. All patients were examined with transesophageal echocardiography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging and clinically during a period of three years. RESULTS: During the three-year follow-up period 6 (5%) of the high risk patients had cerebral embolism with neurological deficits. 4 (3%) patients died due to embolic events and 17 (13%) patients had silent embolism as documented on MRI. In the control group 8 (7%) patients had embolic events (n = 1 clinically apparent and n = 7 silent embolism) documented on MRI, one was clinically apparent. Study patients with an event had more commonly previous thromboembolism (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with peristent or permanent AF and LA thrombi, dense SEC or reduced LAAv have an explicitly increased risk of cerebral embolism (21%) despite oral anticoagulation. Previous thromboembolic event is another important predictor for an event.
