A 26-year-old man with the diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria presented with papilledema due to increased intracranial pressure without localizing neurological signs. It is concluded that papilledema and benign intracranial hypertension could result from a cerebral vein thrombosis which can complicate the course of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. This has not been a well-recognized feature of the disease.
