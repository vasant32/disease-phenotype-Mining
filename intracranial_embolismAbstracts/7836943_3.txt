In thromboembolic brain infarctions high fibrinogen levels are associated with an increase of both plasma and whole blood viscosity as well as increased aggregability of blood cells. This decreases cerebral perfusion and might reduce blood flow in the penumbra surrounding infarction. An important goal in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction is to reduce fibrinogen and thereby improve the haemorheological state. Heparin-induced extracorporeal low-density lipoprotein/fibrinogen precipitation (HELP) appears to be successful in achieving this. Such treatment reduces lipid fractions, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides (p < 0.0001 each), as well as fibrinogen (p < 0.0001) in a safe and efficacious manner. Whole blood and plasma viscosity are also improved when measured by oscillo-rheometry. Furthermore, the number and aggregation tendency of blood cells is influenced positively as determined by Coulter counting and aggregometry. HELP improves the haemorheological profile to a degree which has not been achieved by haemorheologically active substances.
