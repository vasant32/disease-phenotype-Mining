Long-term results of thirty-eight patients with cardiac myxoma, who underwent resection at National Cardiovascular Center between May, 1978 and December, 1993, were reviewed focussing on embolism, cerebral complication, tumor recurrence and metastasis. The mean age was 49.6 years (range 0 to 74) in 20 female and 18 male. Overall follow-up were known for 35 of 38 patients (92.1%), and an average of follow-up period was 6.7 years (range 0.5 to 15.9 years). 15 of 38 patients (34.2%) had embolism (brain 10, peripheral artery 4, coronary 1) preoperatively. All patients survived operation and the hospital mortality rate was 0%. Long-term results were almost satisfactory (myxoma related-death in one patients). However, distant metastasis occurred in two patients, and tumor recurrence in one patient irrespective of a presence of preoperative embolism. Cerebral embolism occurred in one patient and cerebral arterial lesins were noticed in five patients postoperatively. Cardiac myxoma has a malignant potentiality and a close follow-up is necessary about recurrence, metastasis and cerebral artery disease.
