Past over two years, thirteen cases of aortic arch aneurysm, including 5 proximal arch aneurysms, 5 transverse arch aneurysms and 3 distal arch aneurysms, were operated under retrograde cerebral perfusion with deep hypothermia. In the operation, tympanic temperature, rectal temperature and SEP were monitored. When the rectal temperature fell to 20 degrees C, circulatory arrest was done and retrograde cerebral perfusion was started through SVC venous cannula, at the rate of 200-300 ml/min. During cerebral perfusion, PGE1, Mannitol, Solumedrol were administered and defroxamine as radical scavenger was injected before reperfusion for protection of the brain edema. The duration of retrograde cerebral perfusion was from 28 min to 67 min. (mean 42.8 min). In the retrograde cerebral perfusion, cerebral embolization was prevented and good operative field without cannulation was obtained. Of 13 patients, 3 patients were died of intraoperative myocardial infarction and acute renal failure. Ten patients were alive and recovery of consciousness was complete. In conclusion, retrograde cerebral perfusion method is very simple and useful for the operation of aortic arch aneurysm.
