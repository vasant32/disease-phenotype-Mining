Kawasaki disease leads to typical vascular complications in up to 20 % of untreated cases. We describe a 47-year-old patient with coronary vessel disease, involving the right coronary artery with a huge aneurysmatic dilatation, suspicious for an incomplete form of Kawasaki disease. We found little information about the surgical treatment and postoperative course of this disease in adults. Typically, these infrequent patients present with acute myocardial infarction and require interdisciplinary decision-making.
