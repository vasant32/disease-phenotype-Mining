The largest number of people engaged in sports in Germany play football. There were about 1.5 million sports injuries annually in the previous Federal Republic of Germany. Steinbr√ºck (5) reported that the highest number was found in football players, in whom the injuries of the legs are most frequent. Head and vascular injuries are unusual and seldom in football players. We report on the case of a patient who received an elbow blow from his opponent. He developed a stroke with hemiparesis because of a traumatic dissection of the A. carotis interna.
