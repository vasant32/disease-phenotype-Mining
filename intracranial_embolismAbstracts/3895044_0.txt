Strokes and their sequelae are currently a major medical and social problem. Hence prevention is fundamental. The treatment of evident stroke whether general therapy, target treatment of the cerebral oedema, or specific treatment of the cerebral haemorrhage or thromboembolism is therefore equally important, though subject to controversy. In a case series of 1015 strokes, paramedical assistance and early physiokinesitherapy proved decisive. Specific treatment of the ischaemia using Buflomedil together with computerised EEG monitoring also looks promising.
