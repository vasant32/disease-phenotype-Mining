 PURPOSE: This study was designed to analyze complications and prognosis for different types of stroke patients registered in Aichi Prefecture between 1993 and 2000. METHODS: A total of 23,979 out of 27,304 registered patients in the Aichi stroke patient registration program with 4 type of strokes (cerebral thrombosis (CRT), cerebral embolism (CRE), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)) were analyzed for complications and prognosis (survival, disability, dementia), with reference to gender, age-groups, and types of stroke. RESULTS: A total of 13,365 (55.7%) male (65.5 +/- 12.2 yr: Mean +/- SD) and 10,614 (44.3%) female (69.7 +/- 13.3 yr) patients were registered. As the type of stroke, CRT comprised the highest percentage, both in males (49.5%) and females (41.1%), followed by ICH (males: 30.4%, females: 29.8%). The percentage of SAH in females (17.3%) was found to be about twice as high as that in males (8.3%). Analyses of complications revealed hypertension to be the greatest risk factor in both sexes (about 50%), followed by history of stroke (males: 20.1%, females: 16.2%). Male patients had a significantly higher overall survival rate (84.7%) than females (81.0%) (P <0.001). SAH was associated with the lowest survival rate in both sexes (about 60%), with statistical significance (P<0.001). Development of disability or/and dementia as sequela of stroke was higher in females (disability: 54.5%, dementia: 21.1%) than in males (44.2%, 15.1%, respectively) (P< 0.001). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the factors most contributing to death were advanced age, a history of stroke, heart disease, and renal insufficiency. For the development of disability and dementia, being femal, of advanced age, with a history of stroke, heart disease, and renal insufficiency were important. Abnormal lipid metabolism appeared to be a protection factor regarding prognosis (survival, disability, dementia). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that hypertension is the most frequently reported complication for all types of stroke except CRE, and logistic regression analyses revealed that the factor contributing most to prognosis (survival, disability, dementia) was a history of stroke. The results suggested the importance of: i) removing hypertansion as the most significant risk factor, as well as diabetes and heart disease in order to prevent strokes; and ii) preventing re-attack(s) of stroke in order to improve the prognosis.
