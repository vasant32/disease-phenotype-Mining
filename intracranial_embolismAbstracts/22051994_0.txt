This article focuses on the first use of the MICHIâ„¢ Neuroprotection System in a transcervical carotid artery stenting procedure. The patient presented with an asymptomatic, 80% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery extending into the common carotid artery. The lesion was successfully treated with transcervical carotid access and reverse flow embolic protection and the successful placement of a carotid stent followed by balloon post-dilatation. Transcranial Doppler monitoring was performed throughout the procedure and a total of two micro embolic signals were recorded over the 30 minute procedural period. There were no neurologic complications reported during the 30-day follow-up period.
