In patients with an acute cerebrovascular insufficiency a great number of disturbances of the cardiac rhythm is existing. In our investigations the absolute arrhythmia with auricular fibrillation and flutter (21%), ventricular and supraventricular extrasystoles (22%), atrioventricular blocks (13%) and patterns of bundle-branch block (25%) are concerned. Disturbances of the repolarisation of different size were present in 74% of all patients. A pathological QT-interval was to be stated in 31% of the patients examined. In the decreased patients a greater number of the disturbances of rhythm proved was to be observed. There were significant differences in disturbances of repolarisation. We stated a tendency to significance in the tachyarrhythmia. Apart from the sinus tachycardia the atrioventricular blocks were particularly distinct in the cerebral haemorrhage. The tachyarrhythmia was characteristic in patients with cerebral embolism. The mixed form of the cerebrovascular insufficiency was associated with a sinus bradycardia - above all as an expression of the cerebral pressure.
