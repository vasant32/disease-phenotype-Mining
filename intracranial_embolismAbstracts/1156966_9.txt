To determine the incidence of and risk factors in cerebrovascular disease in Manitoba, all 1367 new cases in defined areas (population, 660 391) in an 18-month period were studied. Pertinent data were collected from hospital records, death certificates and autopsy reports. The annual incidence of cerebrovascular disease in these areas was 138/100 000 and the incidence was generally higher in men than in women. The incidence of cerebral infarction (INF) and that of hemorrhage (HGE) were similar in men and women less than 50 years old; thereafter the incidence of INF increased faster with age than did that of HGE, the disparity being greater in men than in women, whereas the incidence of HGE increased at similar rates in the two sexes. The incidence of INF was significantly greater in men than in women in urban areas, and in men it was greater in urban than in rural areas. Elevated concentrations of serum lipids and smoking are implicated as risk factors in INF, and hypertension as a risk factor in HGE.
