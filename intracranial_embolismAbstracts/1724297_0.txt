Twenty-four intracranial aneurysms over 20 mm in diameter were studied with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR imaging follow-up of eight cases revealed induced thrombus with homogeneous intensity and decreased size even after complete intraluminal thrombosis. Most cases demonstrated homogeneous intensity thrombus in contrast to the heterogeneous intensity of spontaneous thrombus. The clinical symptoms could not be explained retrospectively by the thrombus characteristics. Perianeurysmal high intensity, indicating cerebral edema, was detected in one case presenting with a rapid increase in size. MR imaging is useful for following these pathological intra- and perianeurysmal changes.
