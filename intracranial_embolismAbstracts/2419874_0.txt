A 56-year-old man developed sinus node dysfunction culminating in 27 seconds of asystole during a thrombotic stroke. Bradyarrhythmias resolved over a period of 96 hours, at which time sinus node recovery times were normal. Sinus node dysfunction has not recurred during the two years of follow-up. We suggest that cardiac rhythm be closely monitored in acute stroke patients.
