In some cases, basilar artery aneurysms cannot be repaired surgically and the basilar artery is occluded near the neck of the aneurysm to stop flow into the aneurysm. After the operation, the aneurysm can fill only by flow through the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs). Hemodynamically if the flow were the same in both PCoAs and there were no phase lag in the pressures, there would be no pressure gradient for flow to go across the neck of the aneurysm and therefore the aneurysm would thrombose. We have assumed that the diameter of the artery is roughly proportional to the flow that goes through it chronically. We measured the diameters of the PCoAs in 25 patients who had hunterian ligation of the basilar artery. We also measured the maximal width, height, and depth of the aneurysms on angiograms obtained before and after operation. Eleven aneurysms thrombosed completely and had a diameter ratio of greater than 0.6; 10 aneurysms thrombosed partially and had a diameter ratio of 0.46 approximately 1.0; 4 aneurysms did not change and had a diameter ratio of less than 0.45. The ratio of the sizes of the PCoAs pre- and postoperatively was comparable in most cases, so we believe that it is possible to predict reasonably accurately from this simple measurement whether the aneurysm is likely to thrombose if the basilar artery is ligated.
