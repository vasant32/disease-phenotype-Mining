The present study has comparatively analyzed two procedures of auxiliary venous drainage: 1) that by means of vacuum (VaVD), 2) that using an additional roller pump (ARP) and the conventional extracorporeal circulation (EC) with gravitation venous drainage (GVD). The material for the study was the number of microembolic signals (MES) in the middle cerebral artery bed and neurological disorders in patients operated on for cardiac valvular diseases. According to the venous drainage procedure, the patients (n = 90) were divided into 3 groups: 1) those (n = 30) with traditional GVD; 2) those (n = 30) with VaVD; 3) those (n = 30) with ARP. The study revealed the impact of different venous drainage procedures on the number of MES and the patients' neurological status.
