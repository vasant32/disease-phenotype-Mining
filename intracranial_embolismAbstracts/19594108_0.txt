We report a 71-year-old man who presented with acute right hemiparesis and aphasia The admission CT and CT angiogram showed multiple small calcified emboli in branches of the left middle cerebral artery. The patient had shown no sign of improvement after intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Follow-up CT indicated acute multiple infarctions in the left middle cerebral artery area coincident with the calcified emboli. Carotid duplex sonography and cervical CT angiogram showed calcified plaque with ulceration at the origin of left internal carotid artery, which is the origin of those emboli Since calcified cerebral emboli (CCE) are rare, it should be further investigated if intravenous thrombolysis is effective in CCE.
