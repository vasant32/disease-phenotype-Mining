The stroke is one of the major causes for death and invalidization in the modern society. In about 30% of the cases the stroke is attributed to stenosis of a supraaortic vessel. In the last few years the percutaneous angioplasty and stenting is an alternative method of the classical surgical treatment--the carotid thrombendarterectomy. Crucial moment in the evolution of the method is the introduction in the practice of the systems for distal embolic protection of the brain and the routine implantation of stents with new design. One of the main conditions for successful and noncomplicated stenting is the respect of a strict procedural protocol. In the article we present the results of 17 cases with angioplasty and stenting of supraaortic vessels performed in our Clinic in the period 07.02.2001-01.07.2001. The immediate success rate is 100%. No major complications (stroke, myocardial infarction and death) were registered. In the midterm follow-up there were no thrombosis and restenosis of the implanted stents. We present four interesting case reports: 1. One stage stenting of right coronary artery and right internal carotid artery, 2. Stenting of a subocclusive right internal carotid stenosis with balloonexpandable stent and 3. Stenting of a vertebral artery as the unique brain supplying vessel and 4. Stenting of subocclusive aortoostial lesion of the brachiocephalic trunk in a patient with totally occluded contralateral internal carotid artery. CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of supraaortic vessels is a safe and reliable method when performed by experienced operator and when are applied the ultimate methods of cerebral protection and the new stent designs. The carotid stenting is a reliable alternative of the surgery and gains more and more popularity.
