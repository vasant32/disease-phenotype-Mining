Four cases are presented in which intermittent ischemic symptomatology was referable to a cerebral hemisphere. Arteriography in each case showed complete occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery in the neck with collateral filling of the ipsilateral intracranial carotid artery into the cavernous portion. Endarterectomy was performed successfully in each case from 1 to 5 weeks after the demonstrated complete occlusion. The collateral circulation to the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and the probable reasons for the technical success of these operations are discussed.
