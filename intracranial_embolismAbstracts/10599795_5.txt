OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of a spin trap agent and a CD18 antibody administered after stroke induction on intracerebral hemorrhaging. The drugs can prevent leukocyte adhesion. METHODS: A rabbit embolic stroke model that produces intracerebral hemorrhage was used. RESULTS: A time course study showed that hemorrhaging was grossly apparent in approximately 50% of the subjects at 5 hours and in 75% at 24 hours after embolization. MDL 101,002, a spin trap agent, administered IV 5 minutes after embolization, significantly decreased the volume of hemorrhage. It also improved the behavior score relative to vehicle-treated rabbits. The CD18 antibody tended to decrease hemorrhage volume. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of MDL 101,002 may be caused by inhibition of free radical injury to brain tissue, thereby protecting brain microvessel integrity. Acute therapy for intracerebral hemorrhage may be feasible.
