In 40 rabbits cerebral ischaemia was induced by autologous blood clot emboli injected into the middle cerebral artery. Autologous blood clot formed spontaneously (within 2 h) in a catheter fixed in the internal carotid artery. The effects of embolization were investigated on arterial blood pressure, respiration, local cerebral blood flow, locally available O2 (aO2), steady (DC) potentials and EEG. After embolization the blood pressure and the frequency of respiration decreased transiently. On the embolized side the local cerebral blood flow, aO2, the frequency and amplitude of the EEG diminished markedly and the DC potentials shifted to negative. Similar but less marked and short-lasting changes could be seen on the contralateral side. Pathological examination of the brains revealed extensive infarction with haemorrhagic components. The technique is a promising method for inducing stroke experimentally and offers various ways for its thorough investigation.
