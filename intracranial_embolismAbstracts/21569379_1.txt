Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is an organism that commonly causes pharyngitis and wound infections. It does not usually cause systemic invasive disease. The organism presents a difficult diagnostic problem because the Clinical Microbiology laboratory has a propensity to view them as diphtheroid organisms of the Corynebacterium species, thus contaminants or normal flora. We describe a case of a 21-year-old female who had endocarditis with cerebral emboli due to Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. This rare condition is associated with significant mortality and to the best of our knowledge; this is the first successfully treated case of A. haemolyticum endocarditis complicated by embolic phenomenon.
