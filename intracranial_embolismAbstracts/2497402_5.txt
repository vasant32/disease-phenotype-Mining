We present the case of a 42-year-old female, who suffered an embolic occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Recanalization was achieved with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) within 7 h after onset of stroke. Post-t-PA infusion angiographic and CT examinations revealed fragmentation of the thrombus and a small putaminal haemorrhage associated with early reperfusion of the MCA. No clinical deterioration was observed and complete recovery occurred within 10 days.
