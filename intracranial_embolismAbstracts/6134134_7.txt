The cerebral distribution of a new class of 123I radiopharmaceuticals was determined by emission tomography after the isotope had been injected intravenously into 20 patients with a variety of neurological disorders. Regional cerebral blood flow images of diagnostic quality were obtained in all cases. Early and late ischaemic stroke showed up as areas of impaired perfusion, and gliomas and secondary deposits as areas of increased or reduced blood flow. A hyperaemic focus was clearly seen in an epileptic patient in whom other imaging techniques, including CT scanning and electroencephalography, had been uninformative. This new technique promises to be an extremely useful addition to the range of radioisotope brain scanning methods.
