A series of 23 cardiac tumors is reported. Six were diagnosed at autopsy; 17 tumors were surgically explored. Eleven of the 17 were myxomas within the left atrium. Eight of the 17 patients presented with congestive heart failure; peripheral and cerebral emboli were also common. The diagnosis was made preoperatively in 10 patients. Two-dimensional echocardiography was the most reliable diagnostic tool. Follow-up averages 55 months; there have been no late deaths or recurrences. The other six surgically treated tumors were: a left ventricular rhabdomyoma, a septal lipoma, a right atrial calcified endocardial mass, a right ventricular fibrosarcoma, a rhabdomyosarcoma, and a sarcoma metastatic to the pericardium and right atrium. From this series and a review of the literature, we concluded that: benign cardiac tumors can usually be excised with a low morbidity and excellent long-term results; malignant cardiac tumors have a dismal prognosis, and operation is primarily diagnostic; tumors metastatic to the heart should be operated upon only if successful palliation seems possible.
