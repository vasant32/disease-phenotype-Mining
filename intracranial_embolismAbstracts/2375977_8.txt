A case of generalized auditory agnosia without aphasia secondary to cardiogenic cerebral embolism is reported. The infarcts in this patient were localized within the bitemporal subcortices as confirmed by computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The findings suggested that interruption of both auditory radiations by bilateral subcortical lesions may play an important role in the occurrence of "cerebral auditory disorders."
