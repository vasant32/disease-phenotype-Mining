We present three patients who were admitted to our institution with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia diagnosed at CT angiography. Two patients had associated intraarterial thrombi and one patient had basilar artery dissection. Shaded surface display images were useful in showing arterial anatomy relative to the skull base. Source images and curved-reformatted images were helpful in diagnosing thrombi and dissection. CT angiography is a minimally invasive means of diagnosing and following up these patients.
