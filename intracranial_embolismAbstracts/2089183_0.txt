A patient with fibromuscular dysplasia associated with primary thrombocythemia is reported. The patient, a 46-year-old female, had recurrent episodes of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents. Cranial CT scans revealed multiple low density areas in the right frontal and parietal lobes, and cerebral angiograms showed evidence of multiple embolisms. In addition, occlusion of the right internal carotid artery developed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on fibromuscular dysplasia complicated by essential thrombocythemia. The pathogenesis of the severe thrombotic tendency is discussed.
