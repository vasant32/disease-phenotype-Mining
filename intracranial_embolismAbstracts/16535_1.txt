From October 1st 1970 to October 1st 1975, electrical and clinical post-operative observation of 1.700 operations under E.C.C. allowed record of E.E.G.  and thus study incidents depending of cerebral embolism during their formation. 18 cases have been seen during E.C.C. and 2 at the stop of E.C.C. In 9 cases, it was an air embolus, in 4 others an atheromatous embolus. In the 7 remaining cases, origin of the embolus is uncertain, but probably gaseous. Semiology of the accident is first only E.E.G. In 10 cases, signs were minor, and moderate in 10 others, preceding a late but hard clinical symptomatology, frequently characterized by a delayed advent of epilepsy crisis. Later on, an annoying evolution of the accident was seen in 4 cases (1 death, 3 lasting neurologic deficiency). For the treatment, many observations confirm the highly beneficient part of early hyperbaric oxygen.
