The authors describe the epidemiology and the physiopathological aspects of ischemic strokes in patients with a history of oestroprogestogen use. They then study their main radiological correlates: arterial infarcts at CT scan and angiographic non-specific lesions which can be included in the extremely wide framework of arteritis and, much more rarely, venous thrombophlebitis.
