A premature male baby (28 weeks gestational age) was delivered by Cesarean section and required ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome during the first postnatal week. Four weeks postnatally, he had an episode of transient renal failure followed by lethargy leading to coma. Ultrasound changes were interpreted as intraventricular hemorrhage, grade 2. The baby died 31 days after birth. Autopsy showed bilateral thrombosis of the deep cerebral veins.
