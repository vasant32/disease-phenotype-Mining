In patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive to visualize the recent ischemic lesions than conventional MRI. We examined the clinical characteristics of TIA patients presenting with enhanced lesions visualized by contrast-enhanced MRI. We retrospectively evaluated 64 patients with carotid TIAs. We evaluated the frequency and topography of TIA associated infarcts on contrast-enhanced MRI and compared the clinical background of patients with and without such lesions. Twenty-three patients underwent plain MRI only, while the remaining 41 patients underwent contrast-enhanced MRI. Of the latter 41 patients, 16 had abnormal enhanced lesions (39%: group L), while 25 had no lesions (61%: group NL). In group L, all lesions were spotty, and they were located in the cerebral cortex in 13 patients (81%), the subcortex in two (12%), and the perforator territory in one (6%). Aphasia or confusional state, hypertension, and emboligenic cardiac or arterial disease (stenosis > or =50%) were more frequently observed in group L than in group NL (38 vs. 8%, 81 vs. 48%, and 93 vs. 60%, respectively, P<0. 05). The TIA patients with enhanced lesions on MRI may be associated with an emboligenic cardiac or arterial disease, severe neurologic symptom compared to those without them.
