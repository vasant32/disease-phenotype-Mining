Sixty-seven patients (27.9%) between 16 and 45 years, out of 240 cases of stroke seen over 33 months were further studied with respect to stroke type, aetiological and social factors. The frequency of non-embolic cerebral infarction was 58.2%, cerebral embolism 7.5%; cerebral haemorrhage 17.9%; primary subarachnoid haemorrhage 11.9%. Hypertension was the commonest aetiological factor occurring in 35.8% of the cases. Cervical spine hyperflexion, stenosing carotid arteritis, cocaine ingestion, mitral valve prolapse, non-valvular atrial fibrillation and chorion cancer featured among other less frequent but important factors presenting different diagnostic problems. The frequency of unexplained stroke was under 12%. The authors suggest that previously encountered cervical spine trauma among young stroke cases represent underreporting and that the relationship between young age, grand-multiparity and non-valvular atrial fibrillation be further elucidated.
