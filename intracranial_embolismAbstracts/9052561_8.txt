 PURPOSE: This study aims to describe the spectrum of clinical thrombotic events and to compare the methods of laboratory evaluation for the newly described prothrombotic factor V Leiden mutation. METHODS: Specimens from 1376 patients with thrombotic events or their relatives were tested for the factor V Leiden mutation by polymerase chain reaction plus restriction digest from Jan. 1, 1995, to Mar. 31, 1996. Activated protein C (APC) resistance test data was available for 554 of these patients. Clinical information was available for 166 patients with the mutation. RESULTS: Of 1376 patients tested for factor V Leiden mutation, 270 (19.6%) were positive, with 12 homozygotes and 258 heterozygotes. Of 554 patients for whom APC resistance data was available, 221 (39.9%) had low APC resistance ratios (< or = 2.4); of these only 97 (43.9%) were factor V Leiden-positive. Among 333 samples with normal or elevated APC resistance ratios, 19 (5.7%) were later identified with the factor V Leiden mutation, despite the normal screening test. One hundred fourteen of 166 patients (68.7%) with the mutation had at least one thrombotic event, most commonly deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus. Arterial cerebrovascular thrombotic events occurred in 11 patients (10%), and myocardial infarctions in eight (7%). The mean age of all patients with arterial thrombotic events was 45.4 years. CONCLUSIONS: The factor V mutation is a common cause of venous thromboses but may also be associated with the early presentation of arterial thrombotic events. The APC resistance test is a sensitive screening assay but has limitations of its specificity in clinical practice.
