Lesions of the sensorimotor cortex, or of the capsular pathways beneath it, caused (with one exception out of 14 cases) diminution "r loss of the servo responses in the thumb, which are based on the long-latency stretch reflex. When not absent the long-latency stretch reflex tended to be late in onset. When absent it was often replaced by a large early reflex response at spinal latency. In general the results are consistent with the transcortical theory of the long-latency stretch reflex for the thumb, but, in detail, they indicate that the theory will require elaboration.
