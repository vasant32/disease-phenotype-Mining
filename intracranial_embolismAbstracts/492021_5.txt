Of 210 patients with thyrotoxicosis, 21 (10%) had atrial fibrillation. Five of these patients (24%) had systemic emboli (which were multiple in three patients, one of whom died) and two other patients had pulmonary embolism. Embolic disease is common in thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulant therapy should be considered for all patients.
