Calcific brain embolization leading to stroke is rarely recognized. We report a case of spontaneous embolization to the right cerebral circulation from a severely regurgitant, calcified bicuspid valve. Bicuspid aortic valves constitute the most common congenital heart abnormality, and have a tendency to become stenosed, regurgitant, calcified, or infected. The presence of heavy calcification in a noninfected bicuspid valve may lead to dislodgement of calcific embolic material which is not necessarily heralded by acute valvular rupture. Accurate localization of the calcific embolus to the right supraclinoid internal carotid artery was provided by spiral CT imaging in this case.
