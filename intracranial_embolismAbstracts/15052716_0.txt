The most frequent arrhythmia is an atrial fibrillation, which involves 10% of population over 70. The mortality in this group is 2 times higher than in general population. Moreover, if the atrial fibrillation co-exists with the rheumatic disease, the risk of the brain embolism is growing up 17 times. In the many European medical centers, intraoperative ablation is the obligatory procedure performed during mitral valve replacement/mitral valvuloplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting. Results of that procedure (in experienced centers) are evaluated on 75%. It reduces significantly the cost of the farther pharmacological treatment and improves the quality of life of the patients. In our Clinic ablation is performed in patients qualified to the mitral valve replacement or mitral valvuloplasty. All procedures are performed in extracorporeal circulation, in general and local hypothermia, with using crystal cardioplegine. Before the clumping of the aorta, on the beating heart ablation in the right atrium is performed. After that, the aorta is being clumped and the heart is being stopped. The left cardiac auricle is being cut off. Then the ablation around the ostia of the pulmonary veins is being done. After that, mitral valve replacement or mitral valvuloplasty procedure is being performed. Changes in the heart wall are transmural through the full wall. From the December 2001 till today 4 ablation procedures were done. Units Cobra (Boston Scientific) and Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System (Medtronic) were used. Both units are based on the unipolar energy with frequency similar to the radio-waves. After this procedure, regular rhythm came back in our 4 patients. Advantages of the intraoperative ablation are: simultaneous procedure with open heart operation, reduction of the price of the treatment, minimal risk of complication.
