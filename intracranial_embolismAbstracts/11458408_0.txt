Cerebral embolization has been documented as one of the complications of diagnostic heart catheterization by transcranial Doppler (TCD). This study aimed to evaluate our hypothesis that the nature of embolic signals involved in different stages of catheter manipulation may be distinct. TCD-detected cerebral emboli occurring at different phases of cardiac catheterization were registered and differentiated by comparing their acoustic signatures with the Doppler signals generated from clinically frequently encountered embolic materials in an in vitro middle cerebral artery model. We found that there was a significant difference in embolic signal intensity and duration between different phases of cardiac catheterization. Our data suggest that different types of emboli may be involved in different phases of the catheterization. Cathet Cardiovasc Intervent 2001;53:323-330.
