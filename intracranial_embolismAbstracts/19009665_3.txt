We report a rare case of acute pulmonary and cerebral complication after transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma. The case involved a large tumor and hepatic vein invasion. Nonspecific pulmonary and cerebral symptoms such as acute dyspnoea and transient consciousness loss developed in the patient, a 49-year-old woman, following the TACE due to pulmonary and cerebral oil embolism. The chest and brain conditions of this patient improved after some supportive therapies and nursing interventions. She also subsequently completed the other three procedures of TACE.
