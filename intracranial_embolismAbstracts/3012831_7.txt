A major right hemispheric infarct developed in a 31-year-old man within forty-eight hours of lung resection for metastatic synovial-cell sarcoma. Post mortem exam revealed tumorous occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Major stroke from cerebral tumor embolus should be seriously considered in patients with primary or metastatic lung cancer who have had a very recent pneumonectomy, especially when there are symptoms and signs of multi-organ or extremity ischemia.
