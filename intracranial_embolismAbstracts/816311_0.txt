Left ventricular myxomata are exceptional (12 published cases). In the case reported, the clinical picture included emboli (cerebral and coronary) and syncope. Auscultation, the electrocardiogram and the phonomechanocardiographic tracings suggested an impaired left ventricular ejection, while the left ventriculography demonstrated the tumour and the coronary arteriography its vascular relationship with the right coronary artery. Cure was obtained by surgical removal. In that respect, an attempt was made to describe the clinical and paraclinical bases for the diagnosis of the myxomata of the left ventricle.
