A 48-year-old female had been visiting the outpatient clinic for treatment of polyarthritis before she was admitted to the hospital due to consciousness disorder and right hemiplegia. Brain computed tomography revealed a small infarction in the left cerebrum. Echocardiography revealed a mass in the left atrium. She was diagnosed cerebral embolism caused by left atrial myxoma. Extirpation of left atrial myxoma was performed 16 days after the onset of cerebral infarction. The postoperative course was good. Preoperative constitutional signs such as multiple arthralgia and abnormal sensation disappeared on the 2nd postoperative day. Open heart surgery performed early after the onset of cerebral embolism is generally considered contraindicated due to problems of hemorrhagic infarction or brain edema. Because relapse of embolism may deteriorate the condition, losing the chance of surgery, extirpation of left atrial myxoma early after the onset of cerebral infarction is advisable in cases of small infarction.
