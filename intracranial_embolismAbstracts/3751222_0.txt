A 33-year-old man had suffered recurrent arterial embolisms. Echocardiography identified as the most likely cause a large mobile mass in the left ventricle. Initially a primary heart tumor was discussed, but the ECG finding of an anterolateral scar and an angiographically proven LAD-stenosis were suspicious of an organized thrombus of the left ventricle. After surgical excision, histological analysis classified the mass as an organized thrombus.
