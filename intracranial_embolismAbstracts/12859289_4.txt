OBJECTIVES: Cerebral air embolism was induced in pigs and changes in intracranial pressure (ICP), brain oxygen (PbrO2), brain carbon dioxide (PbrCO2), brain pH (brpH) and glucose, lactate and pyruvate levels were used to characterize this model. METHODS: In seven anesthetized pigs, ICP, PbrO2, PbrCO2 and brpH were measured continuously with multiparameter sensors and brain glucose metabolism by microdialysis. After injection of air into the internal carotid artery, these parameters were recorded for 2 h. RESULTS: ICP increased (433%) from 12 +/- 1 to 52 +/- 8 mmHg (P < 0.05). PbrO2 decreased from 25.7 +/- 6.2 to 11.9 +/- 5.2 mmHg. PbrCO2 increased (109%) from 57.7 +/- 2.7 to 120.4 +/- 21.5 mmHg (P < 0.05). Brain glucose decreased (38%) from 3.05 +/- 0.91 to 1.91 +/- 0.55 mmol, while brain lactate increased (384%) from 1.36 +/- 0.15 to 5.22 +/- 0.53 mmol/l (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral air embolism has a deleterious effect on ICP and brain metabolism. Therefore, this model may be suitable for testing therapeutic regimens in cerebral air embolism.
