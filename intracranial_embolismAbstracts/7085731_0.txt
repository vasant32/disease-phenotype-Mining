This study concerned 18 cases of value replacement in patients than 15 years, between 1964 and 1980. In this period, there was a total of 30 such cases, but there were eight hospital deaths and four cases with less than two years postoperative observation. These 12 cases were excluded from the study. The average follow-up period of the 18 cases was eight years and nine months. During this period, six cases were associated with postoperative complications, which consisted of three cerebral emboli, two malfunctions of the implanted prostheses and one congestive heart failure. Three cases involved prosthesis-related death. Secondary implantations were performed in two cases; one for relative stenosis of the prosthesis and the other for calcification of the porcine xenograft. Physical activity in the 15 survivors has been excellent in all but two cases with arrhythmia and sequelae of cerebral damage due to surgery.
