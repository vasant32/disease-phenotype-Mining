Seven patients are described who had juxtasellar hyperostosis with visual disturbance secondary to non-meningiomatous lesions. Two had chromophobe adenomas, one craniopharyngioma, one carcinoma of the sphenoid sinus, one a thrombosed aneurysm of the intracavernous portion of the internal carotid artery, one epidermoidoma of the orbit, and one chondroblastoma of the anterior clinoid process. The diagnosis of meningioma was entertained initially on the basis of hyperostosis plus visual impairment. Careful evaluation of hyperostosis is essential for correct diagnosis of meningioma, according to our experience. Suprasellar meningiomas almost invariably produce irregular hyperostosis of the planum sphenoidale, often associated with serration and blistering. Sphenoid meningioma, when it is sclerotic, always shows thickening or expansion of the sphenoid wings. Therefore, in the absence of typical meningiomatous hyperostosis, one can readily differentiate non-meningiomatous hyperostosis from true meningioma.
