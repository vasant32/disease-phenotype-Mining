In patients with severe arteriosclerosis or anatomical variations such as a bovine arch, the insertion of a guiding catheter for carotid artery stenting is difficult. The authors use a guide wire system as an anchor and advance the guiding catheter to an area proximal to the stenotic structure. This method is useful and safer than others for carotid artery stenting.
