Cardiac myxoma is the most common benign heart tumor. We report a case with multiple brain metastases, presumably due to tumor embolization. It is important to perform transthoracic echocardiography at a very early stage to exclude structural heart disease in patients with signs of multiple brain metastases. Though myxoma is a rare cause of cerebral embolism, detection of this tumor is relatively easy and surgical resection of myxoma is usually a permanent measure to prevent subsequent stroke.
