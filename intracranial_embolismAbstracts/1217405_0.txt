The presentation is concerned with the neurological symptomatology of brain venous thrombosis (39 cases from literature sources and 22 cases of personal experience). On the basis of such investigations and a large amount of verified cases of thrombosis, the author attempts to establish the most characteristic topical signs of lesions in separate groups of veins. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying difficulties in topical diagnostics are discussed.
