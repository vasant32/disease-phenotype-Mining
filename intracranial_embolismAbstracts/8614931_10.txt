BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-intensity transient signals (HITS) detect ed by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography correspond to microemboli in intracranial arteries. The aim of this study was to determine the time course of cerebral microembolism in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis and to assess its relation to specific symptoms of cerebral ischemia. METHODS: On the basis of criteria established a priori, 69 middle cerebral arteries were selected from a series of consecutive studies obtained at our neurovascular laboratory. All patients had radiological evidence of cervical internal carotid artery disease and had corresponding symptoms. A TC-2000 instrument equipped with special software for microembolus detection was used. Accepted signals were unidirectional from baseline, had a chirping sound, were 9 dB higher than the surrounding blood, and lasted 25 milliseconds or more. RESULTS: HITS were identified in 20 of 69 (29%) arteries. The median interval between onset of symptoms and time of testing was 4 days for HITS-positive arteries and 12 days for those that were HITS negative (P=.0046). Fourteen of 32 (44%) arteries with transient ischemic attacks and 6 of 37 (16%) arteries with cerebral infarction were HITS positive (P=.012). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, HITS are detected more frequently when patients are tested soon after symptoms of cerebral ischemia. HITS are also more prevalent in the territories of arteries with transient ischemic attacks rather than cerebral infarction. These findings may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
