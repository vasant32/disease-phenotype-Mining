BACKGROUND: In patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, high-intensity transient signals detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) have been related to particulate microemboli originating at the stenotic lesion. The occurrence of these microembolic events within the Doppler spectrum should be influenced by antithrombotic agents of proven efficacy in these patients mainly by reducing cerebral embolism. METHODS: Seventy-four of 192 consecutive patients with symptomatic arterial stenosis in the anterior circulation and clinical symptoms within the last 30 days underwent 1-hour bilateral TCD monitoring. Patients were selected, if they presented temporal bone windows enabling transcranial insonation, revealed normal Doppler CO2 test excluding hemodynamic impairment, had not received antithrombotic therapy other than acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) before sonographic examination, and gave informed consent to 1-hour monitoring which could be performed immediately on admission/presentation of the patient at the Department of Neurology. RESULTS: Microembolic events were detected in 38 patients (51%). The proportion of patients with events among 26 patients without antithrombotic medication was 73% as compared with 40% in 48 patients receiving ASA at the time of TCD monitoring (p = 0.023). Multivariate analysis including time from ischemia to TCD, presence and start of ASA prevention, degree and localization of stenosis, and presence of a single or recurrent ischemia revealed that absence of an ASA prevention (odds ratio OR 7.1, 95% confidence interval CI 1.6-31.4, p = 0.010), recurrent ischemic events (OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.6-32.7, p = 0.011), and extracranial localization of the stenosis (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.2, p = 0.038) were independent predictors for microembolic events. CONCLUSION: In patients with symptomatic arterial stenosis, the absence of an ASA medication is associated with the occurrence of TCD-detected microembolic events, suggesting a relation between these events and ASA-sensitive microemboli from the stenotic lesion.
