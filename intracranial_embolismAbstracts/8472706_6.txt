Early diagnosis of acute prosthetic thrombosis remains a challenge. In 20 patients with 23 thrombosed cardiac valves, we evaluated the respective value of transthoracic (TTE) and transoesophageal (TEE) Doppler echocardiography. According to the presence or absence of prosthetic obstruction by continuous-wave Doppler, prostheses were separated into two groups. Group 1 included nine thrombosed prostheses (8 mitral, 1 aortic) with severe obstruction. All patients presented with severe symptoms of heart failure. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography allowed immediate diagnosis of prosthetic thrombosis, even in critically ill patients, showing (1) eccentric transprosthetic colour flow jets in all eight mitral prostheses, (2) severe obstruction on Doppler examination (mean gradient = 18 to 36 mmHg in eight mitral prostheses, and 69 mmHg in one aortic valve), and (3) direct echocardiographic evidence of thrombosis (i.e. thrombus or abnormal disc or leaflet motion) in four patients. All nine patients were immediately treated by surgery (n = 8) or fibrinolysis (n = 1) on the basis of TTE results only. TEE allowed better visualization of thrombus and restricted leaflet or disc motion, but had little influence on patient management. Group 2 included 14 thrombosed prostheses (10 mitral, 4 aortic) with mild or absent obstruction. In three patients with massive mitral prosthetic thrombosis, an associated minimal thrombosis of a prosthetic aortic valve was found at surgery, but was detected neither by TTE, nor by TEE. The 11 remaining patients with isolated partial mitral (n = 10) or aortic (n = 1) thrombosis. Clinical presentation was fever, cerebral embolism, or mild dyspnoea, but no heart failure. TTE was normal in all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
