A 79-year-old right-handed woman was admitted to hospital following sudden onset of severe visual loss in the left eye. Left central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) was diagnosed. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed an asymptomatic hyperintensity in left middle cerebral artery territory. Transcranial Doppler and transesophageal echocardiography revealed patent foramen ovale. No other embolic sources were identified in the carotid artery, aortic arch, or heart. We report herein a case of CRAO caused by paradoxical brain embolism.
