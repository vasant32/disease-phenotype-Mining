The authors have studied the bases of the clinical and CT diagnosis of cerebral arterial occlusion in children from a series of 16 cases. The sequential evolution of the CT appearance seems characteristic depending on the time elapsed since the onset. Contrast enhancement, concerns mainly the grey matter, is maximum during the second and third weeks and should be looked for during this period. The aetiology remains usually hypothetic. Some data, including the angiographic aspect of "endarteritis" may suggest an infectious pathogeny.
