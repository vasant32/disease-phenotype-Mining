The authors present the case of mitral valve prolapse. In a young woman with three-year history of systematically treated epilepsia mitral valve prolapse with a spurious string within left ventricle has been diagnosed echocardiographically in coincidence with the symptoms of haemorrhagic diathesis of von Willebrand type in form of haemoptysis and or/massive haemorrhages in mouth occasionally being preceded by heart rhythm disturbances. No local changes have been observed in otorhinolaryngologic examination, bronchoscopy and gastroscopy. Possible mutual dependence of 3 above stated abnormalities is being discussed. It is not excluded, that mitral prolapse may constitute the primary entity and epilepsia is of secondary character as a result of cerebral ischaemic incidents or of cerebral embolism. It is also a matter of discussion to what extent abrupt haemodynamic disturbances connected with critical fall of systemic blood pressure due to mitral prolapse may influence the haemorrhagic episodes.
