The authors report a case of isolated homonymous hemianopsia secondary to embolic occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery. The cause of embolism was demonstrated to be spondylitic vertebral artery compression. The importance of arteriography is emphasized since the clinical syndrome may be nonspecific and myelographic or plain x-ray changes may be minimal. Surgical therapy is also discussed.
