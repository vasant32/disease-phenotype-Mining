Twenty women of child-bearing age with intracranial venous thrombosis are reported. Thirteen developed thrombosis post-partum; 6 while on oral contraceptives. In one patient no cause was found. All diagnoses were confirmed by carotid angiography and in 10 out of 14 patients laboratory data indicated a hypercoagulable state. Coagulation studies were performed in 14 normal puerperal women, matched by age, who served as controls. No statistical differences was found between thrombotic and control groups. Radiologic signs of sino-venous occlusion are reviewed. Conservative treatment with anti-edematous agents, anticonvulsants and antiplatelet aggregants is advocated.
