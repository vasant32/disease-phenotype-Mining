Thirty-five patients with massive atrial thrombus complicating mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation were treated surgically. The mean age in this series is lower than that reported in the West. Furthermore, the incidence of preoperative embolic manifestations has been less frequent in our experience. We believe it is desirable to document the presence of a thrombus by selective left atrial cineangiography. Surgical treatment was accomplished with an acceptable mortality. The vital role played by the use of low-molecular-weight dextran and early anticoagulation in decreasing the incidence of postoperative cerebral embolism is emphasized. Follow-up data in the survivors has shown excellent functional status with no late embolic phenomena in any subject.
