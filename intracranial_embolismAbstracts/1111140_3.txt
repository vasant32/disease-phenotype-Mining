A child with hydrocephalus had two rare complications of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt: exposure of the abdominal catheter through the surgical incision and perforation of the intestine by a new Raimoundi catheter and its emergence from the anus. No infection occurred. The catheter was replaced with a new one on each occasion, without incident.
