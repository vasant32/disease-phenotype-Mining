In patients with endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus, the issue of medical or surgical treatment still remains controversial. Likewise, there is no agreement in the management of those patients who have suffered cerebral embolism and show large vegetations in echocardiography. Moreover, transthoracic echocardiography not always disclose endocarditis vegetations as accurately as transesophageal echocardiography. We describe a patient with cerebral embolism due to Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis in which adequate medical diagnosis and management was achieved by means of transesophageal echocardiography.
