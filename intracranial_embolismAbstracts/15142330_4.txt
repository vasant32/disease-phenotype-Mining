We describe the technique of percutaneous carotid artery stent placement with distal protection in a patient in whom marked innominate artery ectasia prevented transfemoral access to the right common carotid artery. After induction of general anesthesia, ultrasound was used to guide direct puncture of the common carotid artery followed by the introduction of a 5 French sheath. A GuardWire distal protection balloon (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA) was placed distal to the lesion and deployed at nominal diameter. A balloon-expandable stent was deployed without difficulty. Following stent placement, angiography demonstrated improved flow in the entire right carotid artery territory. There were no complications related to cervical soft tissue damage or clinical embolism. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged in 24 hours. Direct carotid access is acceptable in select patients in whom a transfemoral, brachial, or transradial approach is technically difficult. The use of distal cerebral protection devices may reduce cerebral embolism associated with these procedures.
