The causes of vascular ischaemic accidents are numerous, and when the brain is involved management is limited to the prevention of similar events. Since cardiac sources of embolism potentially curable, we have prospectively analyzed the results of cardiovascular examinations (including ECG and radiography of the chest) and of echocardiography in 102 patients with cerebral or peripheral vascular ischaemic event in order to determine the impact of echocardiography and the influence of different diagnoses on the need for anticoagulant therapy. Intracardiac thrombi, mitral stenosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, severe left ventricular dysfunction with or without aneurysm and cardiac valve vegetations were regarded as diseases carrying a high risk of embolism, the low risk diseases being mitral valve prolapse, mitral annulus calcification and isolated left atrial dilatation. Atrial fibrillation was treated separately, as it may be associated with several of the diseases listed above. We found 14 diseases with a high risk of embolism (14 p. 100) and 35 diseases with a low risk of embolism (34 p. 100). 10/91 patients with cerebral vascular accident (11 p. 100) and 4/11 patients with peripheral vascular accident presented with a heart disease carrying a high risk of embolism. The most common heart disease with a high risk of embolism (10/14, 71 p. 100) was severe left ventricular dysfunction secondary to a coronary disease or a dilated cardiomyopathy. We did not find more cases of mitral valve prolapse or mitral annulus calcification than in the normal population. 20/29 patients with normal cardiac examination had a normal echocardiogram. The anticoagulant treatment was modified after echocardiography in only one case.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
