A total of 251 young patients (less than 40 years) with stroke were admitted during a 7-year period and investigated. These constituted 30% of the total stroke patients admitted to this hospital. Among the young, 63% of strokes were of nonembolic occlusive group. Hemorrhagic strokes were observed in 26% cases. This study revealed that concurrent infection, nonspecific arteritis, diabetes mellitus and hypertension contribute very little to the stroke in younger population. However, cholesterol, beta-lipoproteins, triglycerides, platelet adhesiveness and platelet aggregation were significantly increased in some of the clinical groups.
