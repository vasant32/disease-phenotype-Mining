An anterior mitral leaflet aneurysm was detected by two-dimensional echocardiography using the transesophageal approach in a 53-year-old patient with cerebral ischemic event. The transesophageal examination allowed a clear description of the aneurysm which was confirmed during surgery. This case demonstrates that transesophageal echocardiography is the method of choice in evaluation of distinct valvular lesions. The importance of TEE examination in patients with a neurological history is evident.
