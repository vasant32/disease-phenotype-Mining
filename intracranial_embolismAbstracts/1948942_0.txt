Cerebral air embolism is a rare but serious complication to percutaneous transthoracic fine needle aspiration of the lung. A case is described after puncture of a tumour in the right lung with a 0.6 mm needle. The patient developed paralysis of the upper and lower extremities on his left side, probably due to an air embolism in the right middle cerebral artery. He was fully restituted after early hyperbaric treatment with oxygen.
