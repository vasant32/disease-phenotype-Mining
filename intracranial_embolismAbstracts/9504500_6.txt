Traumatic aneurysms are rare and occur most commonly in young adults; however, the relative frequency in the pediatric population is high, owing to the low prevalence of congenital saccular aneurysms in children.

We present a case of a posttraumatic aneurysm in a child that occurred after a fall from a large height and that spontaneously thrombosed.
