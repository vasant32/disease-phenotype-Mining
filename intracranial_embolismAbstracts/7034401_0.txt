86 patients underwent microanastomoses to branches of the anterior-, medial-and posterior cerebral arteries and the inferior cerebellar artery. Intraoperative electromagnetic measurement yielded a mean flow of 33 ml/min with a velocity of 11 to 54 cm/s. The brain circulation increased by a percentage of 38. In a percentage of 90 postoperative angiographic controls turned out anastomoses to be patent. By this surgical technique unilateral brain circulation can be improved significantly.
