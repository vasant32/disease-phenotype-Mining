To summarize it can be said that an analysis of 1080 cerebral angiographies of children and juveniles up to 16 years of age and an examination of clinical results obtained for a stock of unsifted pediatric and neurosurgical patients allowed as many as 145 cases of vascular processes to be detected in children and juveniles. This number appears to be relatively large even if we consider that we are concerned here with a selected patient stock of a supraregional specialized clinic. If we also consider that the number of angiographies presently performed in cases of vascular disease processes is still comparatively small and that patients have to wait indiscussibly long times before being finally angiographed, then it is obvious that many a vascular disease process still goes undetected or is either misinterpreted or made clear at too late a time. It is here that much remains to be done in order to provide the necessary material basis, for what we still lack is the necessary number of costly diagnostic facilities with highly qualified diagnosticians as well as the necessary follow-up facilities such as, for example, neurosurgical, vasculosurgical, and intensive care units. We therefore welcome recent improvements in this direction, especially since the realization of a large-scale project would make possible an optimum diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease processes in both children and juveniles.
