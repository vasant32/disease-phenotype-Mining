The St. Jude Medical cardiac valve is a low-profile, bileaflet, central-flow prosthesis made of pyrolitic carbon. During a 39-month period (October 1, 1979 to December 31, 1982) a total of 169 St. Jude valves were implanted in 155 patients. While 141 patients received one valve, 95 in the aortic, 45 in the mitral and 1 in the tricuspid position, 14 patients had a double (aortic and mitral) valve replacement. The perioperative mortality rate was 3.2%. All surviving patients had anticoagulation treatment with acenocoumarol and there was a 98% follow-up during a period of 19.5 +/- 4.5 months. The late mortality rate was 4.7%. Substantial clinical improvement resulted with the St. Jude valve: whereas 81.9% of patients were in NYHA functional class III or IV preoperatively, 87.1% were in class I or II after valve replacement. The patients generally had a slight increase in LDH levels but hemolysis was responsible for moderate anemia only in 5 cases. There were 10 nonfatal neurological accidents, probably due to thromboembolic events, resulting in a risk of thromboembolism of 4.04% per patient year; 4 of the 10 patients were incompletely anticoagulated and 3 had cardiac arrhythmia. There were 5 hemorrhagic complications, one of which was fatal (subarachnoidal hemorrhage). Endocarditis occurred in 4 patients and death ensued in one of these. Seven patients developed perivalvular leak which was moderate in 5 cases and severe in 2 cases. In conclusion, these results are promising and the St. Jude Medical cardiac valve appears to be a valid alternative in surgical therapy of valvular heart disease. However, the risk of thromboembolism justifies long-term anticoagulation.
