 BACKGROUND: The incidence of cerebral thromboembolism after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ranges from 2% to 14%. This study investigated the incidence of cerebral thromboembolism after complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation with or without PVI. METHODS: One hundred consecutive atrial fibrillation (AF) patients (50 paroxysmal and 50 persistent, including 10 longstanding) who underwent CFAE ablation combined with (n = 41, PVI+CFAE group) or without (n = 59, CFAE group) PVI were studied. Coronary angiography (CAG) was conducted with AF ablation in 5 cases in which coronary artery stenosis was suspected on 3D-computed tomography. PVI was performed before CFAE ablation without circular catheter during AF. After termination of AF, additional ablation was performed to complete PVI with a circular catheter. All patients underwent cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted MRI and T2-weighted MRI the day after ablation. RESULTS: New thromboembolism was detected in 7.0%, and there was no significant difference between the 2 strategies (7.3% in PVI+CFAE group, 6.8% in CFAE group). CHADS2 score (1.6 ± 1.0 vs 0.8 ± 0.9, P < 0.05), left atrial volume (LAV; 83.8 ± 27.1 vs 67.8 ± 21.8, P < 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, 53.1 ± 9.2 vs 65.1 ± 9.7, P < 0.01) were significantly different when comparing patients with or without thromboembolism. In multivariate analysis, LVEF (odds ratio [OR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.99; P < 0.05) and concomitant CAG (OR 18.82; 95% CI, 1.77-200.00; P < 0.05) were important predictors of new cerebral thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cerebral microthromboembolism after CFAE ablation was not greater than previous reports in PVI. Cautious management is required during AF ablation, especially in the patients with low LVEF.
