Clinical manifestations and the results of management of infective endocarditis were reported. Of 46 patients, 17 cases received medical treatment alone (group A), and 29 cases underwent surgical interventions (group B). Affected valves were aortic in 29, and mitral in 24. In group B, however, infection occurred on the aortic valve in 22, and on the mitral valve in 11. Aortic valve was more often affected in group B than in group A (p less than 0.05). Embolic complications were observed in 5 of group A, 4 of whom had involvement of cerebral vessels, and in 4 of group B, all of whom had cerebral emboli. Of 8 cerebral embolic episodes, 6 emboli originated from mitral valvular lesions. In group A, 6 (35.3%) died of cerebral accidents or acute heart failure within 30 days after the onset of illness. In group B, 20 cases were operated on at chronic stage, and 9 cases underwent operation at active stage. Various procedures, alleged to be the most favorable, were selected to the individual patient. No mortality was found in the former group, but one patient (11.1%) in the latter group died of multiple organ failure 31 days after surgery. All patients, who were operated on at active stage, received intravenous administration of antibiotics for 6 to 8 weeks after the operation. Comparing the actuarial survival rate of group A and group B, group B was superior to group A for initial 4 years, but no significant difference was discernible thereafter.
