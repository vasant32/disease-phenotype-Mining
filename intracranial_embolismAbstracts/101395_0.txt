TSH secretion in response to TRH was studied in patients with cerebrovascular diseases in order to elucidate the influence of cerebrovascular lesions on the hypothalamus-anterior pituitary function. Blood specimens were obtained before and at intervals of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the intravenous administration of 500 microgram of TRH. Serum TSH was measured using the RIA method. In 20 normal subjects, the serum TSH level before TRH administration was 1.0 +/- 1.4 microunits/ml (MEAN +/- SD). Following the intravenous administration of TRH, serum TSH increased and reached the maximum level of 9.0 +/- 2.3 microunits/mil at 30 minutes and returned near to the original level at 120 minutes. The response was the same for both male & female patients. In 17 patients with cerebral hemorrhage, the response of serum TSH to TRH was variable, including the types of excess, delayed or low response besides the normal response. In severe cases, cases of acute phase and male patients, a marked variability in the response was observed. In 8 patients with cerebral infarction, a low response of serum TSH to TRH was observed in all cases. There was no difference of the response with regard to severity of the diseases, duration after onset or sex difference of the patients.
