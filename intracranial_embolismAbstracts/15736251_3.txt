The presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients with large pulmonary emboli (PE) is associated with an increased risk of stroke and mortality. Many patients are ineligible to receive thrombolytic therapy. We present a patient with bilateral PE and cryptogenic stroke who was treated effectively with rheolytic thrombectomy with AngioJet, PFO closure with CardioSeal device, and placement of an inferior vena cava filter.
