Several authors have reported a link between childhood stroke and inherited thrombophilia in recent years. The impact of such a relationship on management and outcome is yet to be determined, as is the potential cost-benefit ratio associated with the performance of thrombophilic screening in children presenting with ischemic stroke. We present a case that highlights the need for clinical and radiologic examinations to remain the definitive criteria used to diagnose stroke in children. The diagnosis should not be influenced by the finding of a thrombophilic marker.
