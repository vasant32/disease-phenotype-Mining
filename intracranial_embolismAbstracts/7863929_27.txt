PURPOSE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of delayed intraarterial urokinase therapy with mechanical disruption of clot to treat thromboembolic stroke. METHODS: Thirteen patients with cerebral thrombolic disease (10 carotid territory, 3 basilar territory) were treated with catheter-directed intraarterial urokinase therapy with mechanical disruption of the clots. All patients were excluded from a 6-hour multicenter thrombolytic trial by either time, recent surgery, age, seizure, or myocardial infarction. Time elapsed before treatment ranged from 3.5 to 48 hours (12 +/- 13 hours), with 200,000 to 900,000 U of urokinase used. RESULTS: Ten patients had successful vessel recanalization, confirmed by repeat angiography. Cases with distal branch vessel occlusions were less likely to recanalize. Asymptomatic hemorrhagic conversion occurred in 2 patients on repeat scans. Both acute neurologic and functional outcomes were assessed with significant improvement occurring in 9 (69%) of 13 patients at 48 hours (greater than four-point change on the National Institutes of Health scale) and in 100% of 3-month survivors. All patients who improved had normal initial CT scans. CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial cerebral thrombolysis with mechanical disruption of clot seems to be a useful therapy in selected stroke cases even after 6 hours.
