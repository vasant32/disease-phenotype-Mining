PURPOSE: To determine whether cerebral infarctions classified as embolic or hemodynamic by their appearance on CT scans reflect distinct pathophysiologic entities. METHODS: Cerebral infarctions were retrospectively classified into two groups according to their morphologic appearance on CT scans: territorial infarctions and watershed, or terminal supply area, infarctions. Specific CO2 reactivity for both groups of patients was determined with the xenon-133 method and 32 stationary detectors. Twenty-one patients with unilateral, supratentorial, ischemic cerebral infarctions were selected. CT findings were highly suggestive of a territorial infarction in 14 patients (mean age, 56 years) and of a watershed infarction in seven patients (mean age, 52 years). RESULTS: The initial slope index of the territorial and watershed infarction groups during CO2 inhalation was 55.1 +/- 2.4 sec-1 and 52.0 +/- 1.9 sec-1, respectively, in the infarcted hemispheres and 58.3 +/- 2.3 sec-1 and 55.1 +/- 1.5 sec-1, respectively, in the noninfarcted hemispheres. CO2 reactivity of the unaffected detectors was 1.75 +/- 0.3 sec-1 mm Hg-1 and 1.51 +/- 0.2 sec-1 mm Hg-1 for the territorial and watershed infarction groups, respectively. CO2 reactivity of the affected detectors was 1.75 +/- 0.3 sec-1 mm Hg-1 and 1.27 +/- 0.2 sec-1 mm Hg-1 for the two groups, respectively. The CO2 reactivity difference between affected detectors of the hemodynamic group and age-matched healthy control subjects was significant. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in CO2 reactivity between the two groups supports the concept that CT criteria can identify two pathophysiologic entities. In addition, we conclude that during the chronic stage, lower CO2 reactivity of the watershed infarction indicates that the global hemodynamic situation in these infarcts is more severely compromised than in territorial infarctions.
