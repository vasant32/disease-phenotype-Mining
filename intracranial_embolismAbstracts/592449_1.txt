The presentation and management of a young male patient with a traumatic aneurysm of the intrathoracic portion of the left common carotid artery from a football injury, complicated by cerebral embolization, is detailed. At operation 6 weeks afterward the aneurysm was isolated and ligated and the patient was discharged 19 days postoperation with plans for physical and speech rehabilitation. At 14 months a chronic subdural hematoma which caused some seizures was removed, and the patient's neurologic status is continuing to improve. This appears to be the first report of an isolated blunt injury to this branch of the aortic arch.
