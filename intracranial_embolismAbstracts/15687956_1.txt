OBJECTIVES: Analysis of dose-area product (DAP) in cerebral angiography, according to the type of pathology and technique used. Materials and methods: Use of dosimetric and clinical data resulting from 84 diagnostic cerebral angiograms and 32 cerebral embolizations. RESULTS: The diagnostic angiography data were divided into three categories: A/ When a secondarily embolized aneurysm was diagnosed: n=17. B/ When the final diagnosis was an arteriovenous malformation (AVM): n=10. C/ In the case where the diagnosis was neither AVM, nor aneurysm to embolize: n=57. The cerebral embolizations were classified in two sub-groups: K/ When the embolization immediately followed the diagnostic angiogram: n=15. L/ When the embolization of the aneurysm took place 24 to 48H after the angiography: n=17. The mean DAP of group B containing the AVM is higher than mean DAP values in groups A and C, because of the increased cinegraphic time. There is a strong correlation between the duration of the fluoroscopy and the DAP (n=116; r=0.931; p<0.0001). Addition of runs in the group L contributes to the augmentation of the exposure time (significant difference in time: p=0.0054) and thus with the fact that DAP L>DAPK. CONCLUSION: Radiation dose during diagnostic cerebral angiography is increased in the presence of AVM. DAP of embolizations are higher when diagnostic and therapeutic phases are separated in time.
