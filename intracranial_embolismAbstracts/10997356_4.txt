This study investigates the usefulness of the echocardiographic characteristics of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the stratification of stroke recurrence risk in patients with acute ischemic cerebral disease. Shunting at rest and a highly mobile fossa ovalis membrane are more frequently detected in stroke patients with PFO as the only identifiable cause of embolism. For PFO patients with both rest patency and membrane mobility > 6.5 mm, the risk of stroke/transient ischemic attack recurrence was 7.6% (95% CI, 0-18.0) at 12 months and 12.5% (95% CI, 0-26.1) at 24 months (p = 0.05). The association of both rest patency and high membrane mobility seems to identify those stroke patients with PFO at higher risk for further brain embolism.
