In 10 pts. with mitral valve lesions dense spontaneous echographic contrast was found within the left atrium by transoesophageal echocardiography. Because of the neurologic symptoms some of the patients also had (transitoric ischemic attacks, embolism) left atrial thrombosis was suspected. The echographic phenomenon of spontaneous left atrial contrast was further examined by magnetic resonance imaging in all 10 pts. Using the spin-echo-mode the multi-echo-imaging showed dense signals in the second echo and no or few left atrial signals in the first echo in 8/10 pts. In 2/10 pts. there were no increased signals in left atrium. The missing presence of the increased signals in the first echo excluded thrombosis of the left atrium and proved blood flow effects.
