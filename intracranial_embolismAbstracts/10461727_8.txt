A prior study has reported that a rapid recanalization therapy of cerebral embolism, using liquid jet impacts generated by the interaction of gas bubbles with shock waves, can potentially penetrate through thrombi in as little as a few microseconds with very efficient ablation (Kodama et al. 1997). The present study was undertaken to examine the liquid jet impact effect on fibrinolysis in a tube model of an internal carotid artery. First, the conditions for generating the maximum penetration depth of liquid jets in the tube were investigated. Gelatin was used to mimic thrombi. The shock wave was generated by detonating a silver azide pellet weighing about a few micrograms located in a balloon catheter. The collapse of the inserted gas bubbles and the subsequent liquid jet formation were recorded with high-speed photography. Second, thrombi were formed using fresh human blood from healthy volunteers. The fibrinolysis induced by the liquid jet impact with urokinase was explored. This was conducted under selected conditions based on the experiment using the gelatin. Fibrinolysis was calculated as the percentage of the weight loss of the thrombus. Fibrinolysis with urokinase alone and with a single liquid jet impact with urokinase was 1.9 +/- 3.7% (n = 16) and 20.0 +/- 9.0% (n = 35), respectively, for an incubation time of 60 min. Statistical differences were obtained between all groups (ANOVA). These results suggest that liquid jet impact thrombolysis has the potential to be a rapid and effective therapeutic modality in recanalization therapy for patients with cerebral embolism and other clinical conditions of intra-arterial thrombosis.
