BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the overall short-term outcome of stent-graft repair for thoracic aortic disease in France between June 1999 and May 2001. METHODS: This retrospective study was designed by the French National Health Insurance Fund for Salaried Workers. To ensure objectivity, data were retrieved at each center and checked by a team of medical advisors. RESULTS: Between June 1999 and May 2001, a total of 166 stent-graft repairs for thoracic aortic disease were performed in 166 patients, mainly by surgeons in the operating room (88%). Patients were classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists as status I or II in 24% of cases, status III in 56%, and status IV or V in 20%. The diameter of the thoracic aneurysm was less than 50 mm in 17% of cases. Seventeen patients (10%) died during the first 3 months, including 8 within the first 30 days after the procedure. A total of 49 complications were noted in 34 patients (20.5%). Endoleaks occurred in 27 patients (16.3%), including 8 that necessitated further treatment. Other stent-related complications included rupture (n = 3), aortoesophageal or tracheal fistula (n = 3), paraplegia (n = 6), stent migration (n = 2), visceral embolism (n = 5), and cerebral embolism (n = 2). There were 14 delivery-related complications (8%) at the catheterization site. Non-stent-related complications occurred in 14 (8%). CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study demonstrates that stent-graft repair for thoracic aortic disease can be performed with acceptable postoperative morbidity. However, it is not a risk-free procedure and should continue to be used in an investigative setting.
