MATERIAL AND RESULT: A large thrombosed aneurysm arising from the distal superior cerebellar artery was successfully resected. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: An aneurysm in this location is very rare. Accumulation of intraoperative hemodynamic data may be useful in evaluating the capacity of collateral circulation.
