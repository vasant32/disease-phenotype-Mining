A patient with traumatic dissection of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) was treated by extracranial-intracranial (ECIC) anastomosis. Anastomosis was performed because the near total occlusion of the left ICA was associated with a cerebral transient ischemic attack. At surgery, an embolus was found in a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery and was removed at the time of the ECIC. Traumatic dissection of the ICA is briefly reviewed.
