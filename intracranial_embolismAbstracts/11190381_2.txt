Paradoxical cerebral air embolization through a residual tract after the removal of a central venous catheter is a serious complication of central venous cannulation. Air embolisms resulting from residual catheter tracts in general patients and in single lung transplant patients have been reported. The generally accepted mechanism of this complication is failure of a spontaneous collapse or thrombotic obliteration of a well-formed catheter tract. It may be related to the duration of catheter insertion, the patient's nutritional status, the diameter of the indwelling catheter, the upright position of the patient, deep inspiration or coughing, and improper wound dressing and catheter removal. Cardiovascular collapse, pulmonary or neurologic sequelae, and even death, are commonly noted in patients with air embolism. In this article, we report on cerebral air embolization as a complication with the removal with a central venous catheter in a patient with bullous emphysema. A high degree of suspicion and a prompt diagnosis are required for successful application of established therapy. Simple prophylactic procedures and constant awareness of the unusual mechanism of air embolism remain the best treatment.
