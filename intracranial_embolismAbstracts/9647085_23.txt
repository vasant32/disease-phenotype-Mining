BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing implantation of left ventricular assist systems (LVAS) are prone to thromboembolic complications. We analyzed the incidence, clinical findings, and outcome of neurologic and systemic thromboembolic events (TE) in patients with the Novacor N100 LVAS. In a subset of patients, transcranial Doppler sonography was used to detect microembolic signals. METHODS: Thirty-six patients underwent implantation of a Novacor N100 LVAS for various reasons. The surgical procedure was elective in 18 patients and scheduled on an urgent or emergency basis in another 18 patients. The assist period lasted from 17 to 336 days (109 +/- 88 days); 22 patients were forwarded to heart transplantation after being supported for 140 +/- 87 days. RESULTS: Clinical cerebral embolism was evident in 17 patients (47%). Thromboembolic events were singular in 8 and multiple in 9 patients; in the latter up to 10 TE occurred (mean +/- SD, 1.4 +/- 2 TE). Leading neurologic symptoms were unilateral hemiplegia in 11, as well as ocular symptoms and aphasia in 12 patients each. Noncerebral TE were detected in 4 patients, 2 of whom underwent an emergency operation for intestinal and iliac artery occlusion. The incidence of TE did not correlate strongly with the interval of LVAS support. Cerebral computed tomography confirmed lesions in 58% of patients. Transcranial Doppler sonography detected microembolic signals on 67% of all recordings, with the microembolic signals being more frequent on days with clinically manifest TE. The outcomes were good, as only 2 patients suffer from neurologic sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Thromboembolism is still a major threat for patients with LVAS implantation. Neurologic sequelae are frequent but have a favorable prognosis, and systemic complications occur considerably less often. Patient selection, adequate anticoagulation, and transcranial Doppler sonography may help to reduce the incidence of TE.
