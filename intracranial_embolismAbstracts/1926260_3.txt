We studied the pattern and outcome of strokes in 200 Saudi patients. Cerebral infarction constituted 87% of strokes, subarachnoid hemorrhage 4.5%, cerebral hemorrhage 6.5%, and venous infarction 2%. The vessel most commonly involved was part or all of the middle cerebral artery, constituting 52% (90) of the 174 arterial infarcts. Lacunar infarcts were seen in 21% (37) of the patients with arterial infarcts. Among all 200 patients, 8% died and 8% had secondary generalized seizures. Hypertension occurred in 41% of the 174 patients with arterial infarcts and 62% of the 13 with cerebral hemorrhages. The highest incidence of hypertension as a risk factor was among those with lacunar infarcts (81%), ganglionic cerebral hemorrhages (80%), and infarcts of deep branches of the middle cerebral artery (57%). Embolic infarcts due to rheumatic heart disease constituted 11% of all arterial infarcts. We conclude that our pattern of strokes is similar to that of the west rather than that of the Japanese, but with less frequent arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms.
