Spontaneous thrombosis of aneurysms occurs rarely in children, and, to our knowledge, there are no reports of aneurysms presenting as an embolic event in a child. We describe the case of a 3-year-old boy whose symptoms initially suggested an ischemic event to the dominant hemisphere. Initial computerized tomography scans indicated an intracranial hemorrhage. Subsequent radiographic study revealed evidence of emboli and, at exploration, a large acutely thrombosed aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery associated with arterial occlusion was found. Entrapment of the aneurysm and thrombectomy provided excellent operative results.
