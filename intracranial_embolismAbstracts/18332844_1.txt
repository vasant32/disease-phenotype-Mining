OBJECTIVE: Primary heart tumors are rare and most of them are benign. The majority of benign cardiac tumors are myxomas, although almost all malignant cardiac tumors are sarcomas. Malignant cardiac tumors usually appear in children. METHODS: There have been cases described of stroke secondary to embolism caused by cardiac sarcomas, but it is rarely the first manifestation of the tumor. RESULTS: We describe a 48-year-old man who suffered a cardioembolic stroke secondary to cardiac sarcoma. CONCLUSION: Malignant cardiac tumors typically appear through 1 of 4 mechanisms: obstruction to blood flow and interference with valve function; local invasion causing arrhythmias or pericardial effusion; embolic phenomena or systemic symptoms. We analyze the characteristics of cardiac sarcoma and the pathophysiology of embolism.
