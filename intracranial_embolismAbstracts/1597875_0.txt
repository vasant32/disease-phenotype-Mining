Twenty-seven patients with peripartum cardiac failure were seen at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Banjul over a 2-year period while one further patient presented 6 months after delivery with a cerebral embolus secondary to a dilated cardiomyopathy. Five (18%, P less than 0.001) patients had twin pregnancies. Seventeen (63%) patients attended for follow-up, of whom eight had evidence of continuing cardiac dysfunction and required treatment with diuretics; two patients were known to have died. In five asymptomatic patients the electrocardiogram had reverted to normal and three patients had further pregnancies without relapse. The bipolar distribution of onset of symptoms in relation to pregnancy was suggestive of two different pathological processes. There was no evidence that cultural habits played any significant part in the aetiology of peripartum cardiac failure in The Gambia.
