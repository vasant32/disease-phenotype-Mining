A 67-year-old male presented with sudden onset of aphasia and right hemiparesis on January 27, 1995. Iatrogenic dissection of the left internal carotid artery occurred during attempted local thrombolytic therapy for embolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. His neurological condition worsened. Following an unsuccessful angioplasty for the dissection, a Palmaz-Schatz stent was deployed over the dissection. Local thrombolytic therapy was then successfully completed. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications were given to prevent further embolic stroke. Follow-up angiography at 2 weeks and 8 months showed good patency of the stented segment. He has experienced no cerebral ischemic events since the treatment.
