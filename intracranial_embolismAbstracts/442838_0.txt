After suture closure of an intraarterial septal defect an atrioventricular block occurred in a 6 years old child. Therefore, the suture was removed and the defect closed by a Dacron patch. The sinus rhythm returned. After the operation convulsions occurred, the patient died after 16h which was considered to be due to cerebral air embolism. Autopsy confirmed a correct operation, but the right middle cerebral artery has been found to be completely occluded by heart muscle and pericardial fat tissue.
