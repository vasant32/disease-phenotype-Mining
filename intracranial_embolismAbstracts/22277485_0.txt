Neuronal stem cells are mobilized after cerebral infarction. We had shown that appropriate support of these stem cells, achieved by therapeutic angiogenesis, enhances neurological recovery in experimental stroke model. Based on these observations, we started cell based therapy using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells for patients after cerebral embolism as phase 1/2a clinical trial. We have treated 6 patients in low dose group (harvest 25 ml of bone marrow cells) and none of them showed treatment-related adverse effects. We are now recruiting another 6 patients in high dose group (harvest 50 ml of bone marrow cells) and are planning to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the therapy after obtaining the results of all 12 patients.
