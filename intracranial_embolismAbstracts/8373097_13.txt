The risk of perioperative strokes has been demonstrated to be very low in general surgical procedures, and somewhat higher in cardiac and carotid artery procedures. We describe 5 patients who underwent major head and neck procedures not requiring carotid ligation and who postoperatively suffered strokes. These occurred between the first and ninth postoperative days. Four of the patients were thought to have had emboli, 3 to the cerebral hemispheres (2 ipsilateral and 1 contralateral to the neck dissections), and another to the lower brain stem. Hypoperfusion was thought to have caused the stroke in the fifth patient. All patients had risk factors for stroke. The cases in our series were difficult to diagnose because of the delayed onset and subtle nature of symptoms, as well as masking of speech and communication due to the operative involved. Thrombogenesis within the internal carotid and vertebral artery systems due to patient positioning and intraoperative cervical manipulation may be an important etiologic factor in this form of stroke.
