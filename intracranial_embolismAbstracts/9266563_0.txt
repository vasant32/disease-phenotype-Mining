Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) has been used to detect microemboli in cases with extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis. However, the mechanism causing microemboli has remained unclear. The purpose of this study is to clarify clinical characteristics and circumstances associated with the genesis of TCD-detected microemboli. Ninety-one cases with more than 30% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries were studied. TCD monitoring was carried out for an hour at the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of each case using a 2-MHz pulse-wave transcranial Doppler device, and high intensity transient signals were counted as microemboli. Digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were also performed in all cases. Microemboli were detected in 30 of 91 cases. Microemboli were significantly well detected in cases with a history of ischemic event and/or cerebral infarction recognized by MRI. Detection of microemboli had no relation to sex, age or clinical risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoke habituation). In contrast, detection of microemboli was significantly related to decrease in cerebral blood flow recognized by SPECT, severity of stenosis and wall irregularity of lesion recognized by angiography. Microemboli can be found in a significantly high percentage of these clinical conditions, which may be risk factors for embolic stroke caused by extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.
