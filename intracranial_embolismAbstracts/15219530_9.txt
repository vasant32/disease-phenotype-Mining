We performed an observational study on 137 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Patients on statins were less likely to have had symptoms in the 4 weeks before CEA (p = 0.0049) and were less likely to have spontaneous cerebral embolization detected by transcranial Doppler (p = 0.0459). Carotid plaques retrieved at CEA from patients taking statins revealed significantly lower concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (p = 0.0176), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (p = 0.0018), and interleukin-6 (p = 0.0005).
