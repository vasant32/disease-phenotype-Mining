Some new predictors of postoperative psychosis in open-heart surgery have been identified in a multifactorial study of somatic and psychological factors: Somatic predictors are lower body weight, higher blood levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine, preoperative use of tranquilizers, especially in patients with double valve replacement or congenital heart disease and preoperative cerebral embolism in mitral valve disease. Bypass-time has not proved to be a valid predictor. Psychological predictors are distress provoked by severity and duration of illness, repeated delay of surgery as well as the manner of psychological coping with the illness.
