The authors conducted a clinico-anatomical analysis of 45 observations with thrombosis of the  vertebral arteries. In the majority of cases thrombosis of the vertebral arteries was isolated. In 5 observations it was combined--with thrombosis of the carotid artery (2 cases), with the middle brain artery (2 cases) and with the posterior cerebellum artery (1 case). In one observation thrombosis of the right innominate, subclavian, general carotid and vertebral arteries was diagnosed clinically and angiographically. Thrombosis of the vertebral arteries occurs in the presence of expressed atherosclerotic changes in the brain vessels with acute stenosis.
