Previous animal models of thromboembolic stroke have focused upon the carotid artery system. An alternative approach utilizing the vertebrobasilar system in rabbits is presented here. Left vertebral artery catheterization was accomplished relatively simply in this model using transfemoral angiographic techniques. Twenty-four-hour-old clot emboli with calculated volumes in the range of 0.007-0.11 cc were delivered by this route and found to lodge at the juncture of the basilar tip and the Circle of Willis in 11 of 13 rabbits. Intra-arterial infusion of streptokinase in one animal resulted in angiographically complete clearing of clot. Certain technical advantages in this particular approach are discussed.
