Carotid artery stenting is a recently introduced treatment in symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery disease with acceptable complication rates. The major risk is perioperative embolic stroke. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) can be used to identify embolic signals and guide therapy. We present a case of symptomatic embolization in a 72-year-old female following carotid stent deployment complicated by haemodynamic changes. Despite concurrent dual antiplatelet medication significant symptomatic embolization occurred even after restoration of the blood pressure, and modulation of the rate of embolization was achieved using dextran-40 guided by TCD monitoring. The patient recovered from an initially profound hemiparesis and dysphasia to minor sensory changes. Microemboli are common following carotid artery stenting and there appears to be a threshold phenomenon associated with prolonged embolization and progression to cerebral infarction. TCD can be used to detect particulate microemboli and therefore may be useful in guiding antithrombotic therapy in this setting. Dextran-40 has been shown to reduce the embolic load following carotid endarterectomy and was used to good effect in this patient in terms of both embolic load and clinical outcome. This is the first case of embolization following carotid stenting successfully treated with dextran-40, and offers a further option for therapeutic intervention in microembolism detected by TCD and stresses the importance of perioperative monitoring of embolic load for postoperative stroke risk.
