An unruptured aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva with intraluminal thrombus that displaced the right coronary artery ostium was diagnosed in a 30 year old Omani man who was investigated for uncontrolled grand mal epilepsy and residual left hemiparesis caused by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery. Surgical intra-aortic closure of the aneurysm, which necessitated a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery, was successful. An aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva is an unusual cause of a thromboembolic cerebrovascular accident.
