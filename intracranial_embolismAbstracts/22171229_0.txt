Delayed cerebral ischaemia as a clinical expression of vasospasm is one of the main complications of subarachnoid haemorrhage. In some cases, ischaemic manifestations can be related to cerebral emboli, but the relationship between vasospasm, damaged endothelial lining, and embolism, remains to be proven. The case is presented of a 56-year-old female patient who, 5 days after the clipping of an aneurysm in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA), suffered transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) of this arterial territory. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography showed an increment of the left MCA mean flow velocity, and 12 microembolic signals were detected in 30 mins. The coexistence of microemboli signals with severe vasospasm in the same arterial segment might suggest a causal relationship between cerebral embolism, severity of vasospasm, and TIAs.
