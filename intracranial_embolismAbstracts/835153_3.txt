To clarify the causal relationship between spontaneous recanalization of the occluded cerebral artery and development of hemorrhagic infarction, 15 patients with internal carotid or middle cerebral arterial axis occlusion were submitted to consecutive lumbar punctures and follow-up cerebral angiography. Consequently, six of seven recanalized patients had sanguineous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the second or third day after ictus, while only one of eight non-recanalized patients had bloody CSF. It was strongly suggested that recanalization might have an initimate relationship with the development of hemorrhagic infarction.
