To assess age-related risks of long term anticoagulation, the records of 348 patients followed up at our university hospital outpatient anticoagulation clinic during a seven year period were reviewed. There were 129 patients, under 56 years of age, 144 from 56 to 69 and 75 over 70 years old. The total observation period was 1089 patient-years (3.3 yrs per pt). 64% of the patients had adequate anticoagulation level (prothrombin time < 35%, INR 2.2-4.5) 70 to 100% of the observation period. Prothrombin time was slightly, but significantly higher in the elderly group. During this period 21 patients developed major bleeding complications (1.84/100 pt yrs), 8 of them with fatal intracranial hemorrhages, and 20 embolic complications (1.93/100 pt yrs), 3 of them fatal. No significant differences in the incidence of both bleeding and embolic complications were observed in the three groups. The results of this retrospective follow-up study suggest that long term anticoagulation can be carried out in elderly pts with risk of hemorrhagic and embolic complications similar to those observed in the general population.
