A case is presented of a ruptured aneurysm located at a leptomeningeal artery associated with an occlusion of the anterior trunk of the middle cerebral artery. A 60-year-old male had a sudden onset of severe headache and hemiplegia. CT showed a left frontal subcortical hematoma. Cerebral angiograms demonstrated an occlusion of the anterior trunk of the left middle cerebral artery with moyamoya phenomenon. In addition, an aneurysm was found arising from the leptomeningeal artery. The parent artery was filled with contrast medium from the middle internal frontal artery. We have reviewed literature and discussed the cause of an aneurysm located at the leptomeningeal artery. Hemodynamic factors were strongly suggested as the reason for the aneurysmal formation in this case.
