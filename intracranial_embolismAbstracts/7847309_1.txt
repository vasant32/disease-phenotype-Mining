Cerebral venous thrombosis is an uncommon complication of ulcerative colitis. We report the case of a 29-yr-old female with a recent diagnosis of ulcerative colitis who suffered stroke secondary to thrombosis of the veins of Galen and straight sinus. A search for a hypercoagulable state revealed a nonfamilial transient protein S deficiency. Possible involvement of C4b-binding protein in this hypercoagulable state is discussed.
