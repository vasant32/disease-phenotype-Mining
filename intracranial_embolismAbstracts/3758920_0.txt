Total of 35 cases of cerebral arterial occlusion were studied with repeated angiography. Cerebral embolisms (E group; 18 cases) were distinguished from cerebral thrombosis (T group; 17 cases) by angiographical criteria: recanalization of occluded arteries of demonstration of embolus with distinct contour. Clinical findings and laboratory data of each group were compared and thought to be well separated. Appropriateness and significance of these criteria are discussed.
