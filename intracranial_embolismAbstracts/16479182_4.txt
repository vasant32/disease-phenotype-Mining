This is an interesting case of a young patient suffering an acute embolic stroke in the middle cerebral artery distribution, who was later found to have a papillary fibroelastoma on the mitral valve. The mass was first recognized by transesophageal echocardiography and eventually resected surgically. The retrieved specimen had classic histologic findings of a papillary fibroelastoma. A thrombus was noted on the tip of the specimen, supporting the theory that these masses are risks for strokes secondary to damage along the endothelial lining predisposing to subsequent fibrin deposition and mural thrombus formation.
