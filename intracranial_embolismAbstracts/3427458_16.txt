We developed a small animal embolic stroke model for pharmacological screening trials. Microspheres are injected into the carotid circulations and group embolus dose-response relationships are calculated. Emboli quantity is related to neurologic injury, and small changes in neurologic function are detectable. Rabbits tolerated twice as many microspheres when cyproheptadine-treated after embolization. This demonstrated both the sensitivity of the model and the value of serotonin antagonists in reducing neurological injury.
