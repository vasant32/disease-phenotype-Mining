A case of massive epicardial lipoma in an asymptomatic patient is presented. The diagnosis of solid intrapericardial mass was achieved by two-dimensional echocardiography without cardiac catheterization. The complications of postoperative course, which included myocardial infarction, cerebral embolism, and the patient's late sudden death, suggest that the cardiopulmonary bypass should be used in similar circumstances. Lipomas of the heart should be kept in mind in patients with unexplained enlargement of the cardiac silhouette whenever pericardial effusion and heart disease may be excluded.
