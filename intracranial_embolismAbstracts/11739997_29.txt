BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The proteasome inhibitor PS-519 blocks activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, a major mediator of inflammation. We tested the hypothesis that combination treatment of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rhtPA) and PS-519 extends the therapeutic window for treatment of stroke with rhtPA without increasing incidence of hemorrhagic transformation. METHODS: The middle cerebral artery (MCA) of male Wistar rats (n=56) was occluded by an embolus. After embolization, animals were randomly divided into the following groups: PS-519 treatment groups: PS-519 was given at 2, 4, or 6 hours after MCA occlusion; rhtPA treatment groups: rhtPA was given at 2 or 4 hours after MCA occlusion; combination treatment groups: PS-519 and rhtPA were given at 2, 4, or 6 hours after MCA occlusion; control group: the same volume of saline was given at 2 hours after MCA occlusion. RESULTS: Administration of PS-519 alone at 2 or 4 hours, but not 6 hours, significantly (P<0.05) reduced infarct volume and improved neurological recovery compared with the control group. Administration of rhtPA alone at 2 hours, but not 4 hours, significantly (P<0.05) reduced infarct volume and improved neurological recovery compared with the control group. Furthermore, combination treatment with rhtPA and PS-519 even at 6 hours significantly (P<0.05) reduced infarct volume, improved neurological recovery, and did not increase the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation compared with the control group or the group treated with PS-519 alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that combination treatment with PS-519 and rhtPA extends the neuroprotective effect to at least 6 hours after embolization.
