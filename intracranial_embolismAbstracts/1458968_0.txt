A series of 108 geriatric patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease were treated with low dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA). Daily doses of 100 mg, 50 mg and 25 mg were administered to three groups of 36 patients. Changes in platelet aggregation responses were dynamically observed in 64 (22 normal subjects, 42 patients). Monitoring of 22 normal subjects revealed inhibition of platelet aggregation at a dose of 300 mg or 100 mg which could last as long as 7 days. This suggests that 100 mg or less could be clinically effective. Satisfactory inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation were observed in all three groups, with 14 patients in each group given daily doses of 100 mg, 50 mg and 25 mg during four weeks' observation. The most effective inhibition was obtained in the 50 mg group. Therefore, the authors recommend 50 mg/d as the optimal dosage for low dose aspirin therapy in geriatric patients.
