Seventy-one cases of carotid siphon stenosis were analyzed for symptom presentation, non-invasive diagnosis, angiographic and CT scan features, and outcome. Our experience indicates that carotid siphon stenosis is a dangerous lesion with serious neurological sequelae, including a high stroke rate. Indirect evidence is presented to suggest that distal embolization is a significant feature of carotid siphon lesion.
