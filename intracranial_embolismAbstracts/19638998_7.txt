We investigated the neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin in combination with delayed thrombolytic therapy in a rat model of embolic stroke. Rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion were treated with atorvastatin at 4 h, followed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at 6 or 8 h after stroke. The combination of atorvastatin at 4 h and tPA at 6 h significantly decreased the size of the embolus at the origin of the MCA, improved microvascular patency, and reduced infarct volume, but did not increase the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation compared with vehicle-treated control animals. However, monotherapy with tPA at 6 h increased the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation and failed to reduce infarct volume compared with the control group. In addition, adjuvant treatment with atorvastatin at 4 h and with tPA at 6 h reduced tPA-induced upregulation of protease-activated receptor-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, and concomitantly reduced cerebral microvascular platelet, neutrophil, and fibrin deposition compared with rats treated with tPA alone at 6 h. In conclusion, a combination of atorvastatin and tPA extended the therapeutic window for stroke to 6 h without increasing the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation. Atorvastatin blocked delayed tPA-potentiated adverse cerebral vascular events, which likely contributes to the neuroprotective effect of the combination therapy.
