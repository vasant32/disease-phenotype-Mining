One case with Wallenberg's syndrome followed by the neck clipping of the posterior inferior cerebellar aneurysm was reported. The patient was 49 years old female with the subarachnoid hemorrhage, who had previously no history of the cardiovascular disease. The vertebral angiogram revealed a saccular aneurysm of the left vertebral artery at the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The preoperative neurological examination were normal, except for the slight degree of the meningeal irritation. The surgical intervention was successfully performed on 39th day after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. Postoperative course was eventful, presenting the typical Wallenberg's syndrome, which was complicated the accompanying signs. The troublesome accompanying signs were chiefly automatic respiratory dysfunction (sleep-induced dyspnea), autonomic dysfunction (Horner's syndrome, perspiration, hypertension), and restless confusion. The postoperative vertebral angiogram showed the obliteration of the aneurysm and the sufficient circulation of the vertebrobasilar system, especially the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The mechanism of "sleep-induced dyspnea" was discussed in detail from the literatures. In addition to the above mentioned, it should be stressed that the recognition of "sleep-induced dyspnea" and the other accompanying signs are important for the treatment of the patient with the brain stem lesion.
