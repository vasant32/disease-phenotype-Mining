The hemostasis function was studied in 33 patients with epileptical seizures of a different etiology. The studies were conducted at the moment of the epileptical seizure or epileptical status and in the interattack period during hyperventilation. The concentration of products of blood fibrinogen degradation, the degree of platelet agregation, their number and prothrombine index were estimated. The data obtained were compared with those of normals. The results of the studies indicate the existence of the syndrome of intravascular coagulation during an epileptical seizure and epileptical status.
