BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microembolic signals (MES) on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) are occasionally detected in acute ischemic stroke patients and gradually decrease over time. If MES is detectable at 7 days after stroke onset, embolic source lesions may still be active. We hypothesized that presence of MES at 7 days after stroke onset is strongly associated with stroke recurrence. METHODS: Subjects comprised 143 patients with acute ischemic stroke who were prospectively examined for the presence of MES using TCD both within 24 h and at 7 days after stroke onset. Stroke recurrence was assessed within 3 months of stroke onset. The association between presence of MES and stroke recurrence was investigated. RESULTS: MES was detected in 70 of 143 patients (49%) within 24 h of stroke onset and in 34 patients (24%) at 7 days. Stroke recurrence was observed in 6 patients after 7 days and in 10 patients between 7 days and 3 months after stroke onset. Presence of MES within 24 h of stroke was not associated with stroke recurrence (10% for MES-positive vs. 12% for MES-negative, p=0.792). At 7 days after onset, stroke recurrence was more frequent in the MES-positive group at 7 days than in the MES-negative group (24% vs. 7%, p<0.0001). Cox's proportional hazard analysis demonstrated presence of MES as an independent factor of stroke recurrence (hazard ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-28; p=0.015). CONCLUSION: Presence of MES detected on TCD at 7 days of stroke onset should be a predictor of stroke recurrence.
