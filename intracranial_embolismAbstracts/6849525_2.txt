A case of cerebral air embolism complicated by oxygen-induced seizures in the hyperbaric environment is presented. Phenytoin sodium (Dilantin) was used during recompression treatment in an attempt to suppress the occurrence of seizure activity. It appeared to inhibit seizure activity, subsequently allowing the patient to be treated with hyperbaric oxygen.
