Distal embolization is the main potential risk of carotid stenting, and techniques to minimize this risk are evolving. Between July 1998 and March 2002, 305 consecutive patients who underwent elective or urgent percutaneous carotid intervention at The Cleveland Clinic were prospectively followed. During this period, the clinical practice of carotid stenting evolved from the routine use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) to routine emboli-prevention device (EPD) placement. A total of 199 patients received adjunctive GPIs (91% abciximab), and 106 patients underwent the procedure with an EPD (85% filter design, 15% occlusive balloon). At 30 days, the composite end point of neurologic death, nonfatal stroke, and major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, was significantly lower among patients treated with EPDs compared with those treated with GPIs (0% vs 5.1%, p = 0.02). EPDs may provide an overall safer and more effective means of neuroprotection during carotid stenting than GPIs.
