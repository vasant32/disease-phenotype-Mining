The association between cerebrovascular complications and detection of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPA) has been under clinical and immunological investigation during the last ten years. The occurrence of aPA in coincidence with recurrent thrombosis, miscarriages and thrombocytopenia is termed "primary antiphospholipid syndrome". The most important neurological symptoms are recurrent cerebral arterial and venous ischemias. Especially in the case of young patients with a history of recurrent infarcts, migraine-like headaches and the absence of classical risk factors should lead to a determination of these antibodies. Although the pathogenetic importance of these antibodies is still unclear, patients positive for them seem to carry a higher cerebrovascular risk and should be observed more cautiously. More studies are necessary to define the origin of these antibodies and their role in thrombogenesis. To develop standards for therapeutic management a multicenter study is desirable.
