Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been recognized as mediator of paradoxical embolism. Concurrent multisite paradoxical embolization is a quite rarely reported occurrence. We present a case of multisite paradoxical embolism (pulmonary, cerebral, upper limb) mediated by a large right-to-left shunt mediated by a PFO with associated a redundant Eustachian valve, successfully treated with PFO transcatheter closure and vena cava filter placement.
