This study presents ultrastructural confirmation of the embolic method of producing an ischemic lesion. The embolic method was shown to produce more advanced parenchymal changes than those reported for the same postocclusion period following vascular clipping. With this method there was less alteration in the morphological intergrity of occluded extraparenchymatous areas of the arterial bed, especially in the associated nerve bundles.
