A 5 year experience in 100 patients with a turtleneck-cuff (Magovern) disc valve (Harken) is presented. The prosthesis was inserted into the atrioventricular position by a continuous suture technique. The operative mortality rate was 7 per cent and the late mortality rate, 8 per cent. Age, functional classification, multiple valve replacement, pulmonary hypertension, and reoperation did not influence the operative mortality rate. However, the incidence of late death was much higher among patients in Class IV than in Class III and was also greater when more than one valve was replaced. The incidence of combined early and late thromboembolic complications was 7 per cent. Peribasilar leaks or valve dehiscences were not encountered.
