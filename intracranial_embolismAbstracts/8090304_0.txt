The authors describe a case of post-traumatic cerebral fat embolism in a 17-year-old patient. SPECT with HM-PAO was used in this case to confirm the suspected diagnosis: where CT and evoked potentials were negative, SPECT showed the changes in vascular flow at the level of the frontal lobes responsible for the vegetative state of the patient. SPECT is therefore a valuable method for the early definition of the conditions of patients in a vegetative state.
