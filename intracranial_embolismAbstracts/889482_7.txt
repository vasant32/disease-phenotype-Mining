Auditory evoked brain stem potentials were measured in a patient with occlusion of the basilar artery about 7 mm above its origin, resulting in the "locked-in" syndrome due to infarction at the junction of the lower one third and upper two thirds of the pons. The first three waves of the evoked response originating from the acoustic nerve and auditory nuclei in the caudal pons were normal in wave form, peak latency, and voltage level. Waves IV and V, generated in the region of the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus in rostral pons and caudal midbrain, demonstrated prolonged peak latency and reduced voltage, indicative of slowed neural conduction in the pons above the level of the superior olivary complex. These findings suggest that auditory evoked potential recordings may have considerable value in the localization of brain stem disorders.
