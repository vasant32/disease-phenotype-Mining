Computertomography permits an early diagnosis of acute intracerebral hemorrhage a few hours after onset of symptoms. Embolic or thrombotic infarcts may be detected only after 2 to 3 days. Late manifestations of ischemic infarcts are unequivocal when confined to the circulation area of a cerebral artery. They must, however, be differentiated from small gliomas with edema, while in cerebral hemorrhage the differential diagnosis must consider bleeding from tumors and vascular malformations.
