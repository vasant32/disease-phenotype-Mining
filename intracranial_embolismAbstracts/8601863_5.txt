The authors assessed the characteristic appearance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cerebral fat embolism in three patients. The MRI features in the acute stage were characterized by widespread, spotty lesions in the white matter, which appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted images and iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images. The relation between clinical features and MRI findings are discussed.
