Pathological-morphological changes in the brain microcirculatory blood vessel in dog after global brain ischemia have been evaluated qualitatively. In series of cut sections thick 200 microns dyed with benzidine, a marked microthrombotization of the brain capillaries without vasostasis as well as cylindrical microthrombi and microthrombi with vasostasis were observed. The described light microscopic angioarchitectonic findings account for the phenomenon of vasomotoric paralysis.
