Neuropathological changes in the cerebellar cortex of microsphere-embolized rats were studied at 30 min and 3 h after the embolism. Necrotic processes including a sponge-like vacuolation in the molecular layer, a vague outline of some Purkinje cells, and a few pyknotic granule cells having small and dark profiles were identified at sometime between 30 min and 3 h after microsphere-induced embolism in Nissl staining. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining shows an apparent reduction in the number of Bergmann glial processes in some of the areas where there was necrosis of the molecular layer and poor astroglia processes in the areas subjacent to the pyknotic granule cells. These data demonstrate that within a short time, microsphere-induced cerebral ischemia produces necrosis of cerebellar neurons (i.e. Purkinje and granule cells) and changes in cerebellar glia cells (i.e. Bergmann and astroglia cells), and that these neuropathological changes are secondary phenomenon caused by microsphere blockage of cerebellar blood flow.
