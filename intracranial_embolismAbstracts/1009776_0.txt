The effect of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) on the performance of verbal and nonverbal tasks at two levels of difficulty by patients with left or right hemispheric lesions and non brain-damaged controls was compared. All subjects showed DAF effects, as measured by increases in response duration and intensity. While controls showed an increase in DAF effects as a function of increased task difficulty, the brain-damaged patients failed to show such an increase on tasks on which they were presumably impaired (verbal tasks for lefts, nonverbal for rights). Findings suggest a clear dissociation between DAF effects in unilateraly lesioned patients due to the nature of the stimulus material and its difficulty level.
