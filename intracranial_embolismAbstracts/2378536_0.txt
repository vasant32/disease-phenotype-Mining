Our group initiated a program of coronary angioplasty (CA) in patients with symptomatic one vessel disease, or multivascular lesions with a critical "culprit" stenosis. In a 16 month period we have performed CA of 28 lesions in 25 patients (20 men) with a mean age of 54 +/- 10 years. Stable angina was diagnosed in 14 patients, unstable angina in 7, and post-myocardial infarction residual angina or stenosis in 4 patients treated with streptokinase. Successful dilatation was obtained in 23 (82.1%) of 28 stenotic segments, reducing the stenosis from 90 +/- 8% (range 70-100) to 9 +/- 12% (range 0-30; p less than 0.00001). In 4 cases with total occlusion, dilatation was not obtained, and in one case the procedure was complicated by fatal brain embolism. There were 4 complications due to coronary occlusion or spasm, all of them resolved during CA without sequelae. The 20 cases with primary success have been followed during an average of 8.6 months. In three cases (15%) restenosis was detected; two of them underwent surgery, and CA was repeated successfully in the other. Disappearance of myocardial ischemia was confirmed in 14 patients, and functional improvement in the other three. In conclusion, CA is an effective and relatively safe therapeutic alternative in different clinical forms of coronary heart disease with a single vessel stenosis, or in selected cases of multivascular lesions with a critical stenosis.
