The authors describe a patient with an unusual clinicopathologic picture of giant aneurysmal hemorrhage followed by sudden deterioration due to acute intra-aneurysmal thrombosis and fatal rebleeding. This patient underscores the poor natural history associated with this devastating disease and serves to highlight the dangers inherent in the delayed treatment of these life-threatening lesions.
