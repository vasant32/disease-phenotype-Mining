A 72-year-old woman with a known history of homozygous familial hyperlipidemia (IIa) was referred to our hospital for an operation necessitated by aortic and mitral stenosis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography and cardiac catheterization revealed a heavily calcified aortic root and mitral annulus as well as a high-grade stenosis of the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries. Double aortic and mitral valve replacement concomitant with replacement of ascending aorta, maze III procedure, and coronary artery bypass were performed. Temporary hypothermic arrest was employed to reduce the risk of cerebral emboli.
