We evaluated 144 patients (81 males and 63 females) aged 15 to 45 years who had nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction. Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction was diagnosed in 38 patients. Potential cardiac causes of cerebral embolism were found in 33 patients. Only three events could be attributed to mitral valve prolapse. Hematologically related disorders were diagnosed in 21 patients, while 38 patients had nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies. Young patients with cerebral infarction are a heterogeneous group. A potential cause can be found in most patients. We found more than 40 possible etiologies among our patients. Mitral valve prolapse apparently is not a common cause of cerebral infarction among young adults. Cerebral infarction should not be ascribed to oral contraceptives or migraine until other possible causes have been eliminated.
