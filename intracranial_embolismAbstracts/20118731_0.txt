We report a case of cerebral lipiodol embolism after transarterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma, which was confirmed by dual-energy computed tomography (CT). A 44-year-old male patient developed left leg weakness after transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. The noncontrast CT scan of his brain revealed multiple high-attenuating lesions scattered along the gyral surface of the both cerebral hemispheres; meanwhile, the lesions disappeared on the iodine-removed virtual noncontrast images generated from dual-energy CT.
