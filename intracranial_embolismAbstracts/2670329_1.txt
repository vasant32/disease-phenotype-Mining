Surgical manipulation of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta in elderly patients is often accompanied by serious complications. To reduce the risk of disrupting highly degenerated but nonpalpable plaques, we used quantitative ultrasonic techniques to intraoperatively image the ascending aorta in 33 patients (mean age, 71 years) as a guide to selection of cross-clamping or cannulation sites. Two-dimensional, integrated backscatter images (integration time, 1.6 mu sec) were obtained with a 5-MHz transducer wrapped in a sterile sheath and placed directly on the aorta. Significant atherosclerotic disease was detected in 18 patients. Calcified lesions were found in 13 patients, and fibrofatty lesions were found in five. In four patients undergoing repair of degenerative aneurysms, the extent and distribution of ultrasonically delineated regions of calcification and fibrosis were confirmed histologically. In eight (24%) patients, the composition, severity, and location of plaques delineated ultrasonically led to selection of alternate cannulation sites without resultant atheroembolism. Thus, ultrasonic tissue characterization sensitively delineates the extent of aortic atherosclerosis, and its use may decrease the risk of atheroembolism.
