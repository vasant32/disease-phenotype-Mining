This report presents 72 cases with mitral annulus calcification. The diagnosis was made by echocardiogram. There were 21 males and 51 females, aged from 38 to 93 (mean 71). The associated clinical findings in these 72 patients included: hypertension, 28 cases; valvular aortic stenosis, 3 cases; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 7 cases; chronic renal failure, 14 cases; congestive heart failure, 29 cases, calcified aortic valve, 27 cases; mitral regurgitation, 46 cases; cerebral infarct, 19 cases; peripheral arterial embolism, 2 cases. Their electrocardiographic findings included: atrial fibrillation, 25 cases; conduction defects, 21 cases; sick sinus syndrome, 3 cases (one case required permanent pacemaker implantation). We conclude that mitral annulus calcification is not a senile change only, and that it also results in some complications such as: mitral regurgitation, cerebral embolism, peripheral arterial embolism, atrial fibrillation and conduction defects. Echocardiography is a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with mitral annulus calcification.
