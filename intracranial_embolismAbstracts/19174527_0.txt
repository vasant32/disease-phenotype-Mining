Absolute cerebral oximetry is useful in clinical settings to identify "catastrophic events" that may occur during the course of surgeries that would otherwise have gone unrecognized. This study reports a case in which cerebral desaturation occurred after commencing cardiopulmonary bypass. Consequently, the source of air entrainment was discovered and therapeutic measures implemented.
