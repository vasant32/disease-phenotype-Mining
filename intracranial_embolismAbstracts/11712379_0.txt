A 66-year-old woman who received maintenance hemodialysis for the last 14 years was referred to our hospital due to the sudden onset of ischemic stroke and systemic emboli. Transthoracic echocardiography before surgery showed large protruding masses measuring 2 cm which projected into the lumen of the aortic root. The plaque originated on a wide base of the posterior aspect of the ascending aorta at its junction with the sinus of Valsalva. The mobile plaque was surgically removed by endarterectomy from the posterior wall of sino-tubular junction under cardiopulmonary bypass. Pathologic examination of the masses removed at the time of surgery showed that they were atherosclerotic plaque with superimposed thrombi. During operation, transesophageal echocardiography appears to be useful for the rapid detection of a protruding aortic atheroma especially in the initial period of cardiopulmonary bypass until aortic cross clamp.
