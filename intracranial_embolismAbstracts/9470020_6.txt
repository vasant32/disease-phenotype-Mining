Bilateral renal vein thrombosis and venous sinus thrombosis were diagnosed within 3 weeks of birth in a full-term neonate. Heterozygosity for a factor V mutation leading to resistance against the anticoagulatory properties of activated protein C was found. Heparin therapy led to resolution of the thrombotic manifestations. With long-term oral anticoagulation, no relapse or other thrombotic event occurred during infancy.
