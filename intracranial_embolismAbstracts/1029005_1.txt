Computerized axial tomography of the cranium has been carried out in 46 patients referred because recurring migrainous headaches. Increasing frequency or severity of headaches or a change in headache pattern were the usual reasons for referral. Abnormalities were found in 37 cases and fell into 4 categories. The most frequent (21 cases) consisted of a mild degree of oedema in the white matter of one or both cerebral hemispheres. This was usually bi-frontal (15 patients) but was more extensive in 2 patients. Varying degrees of cerebral atrophy, as determined by widening of the Sylvian, brain-stem and interhemispheric cisterns, and/or widening of the third and lateral ventricles as compared to a group of normal scans, was found in 8 cases. Areas of occipital infarction were found in 4 patients with permanent visual field defects. Unexpected small areas of infarction were found in the temporal lobe in 2 other cases. Cerebral tumours were found in 2 cases. The significance of these findings is discussed, as well as the possible role of migrainous vaso-spasm with consequent changes in cerebral blood flow in the pathogenesis of oedema and atrophy in migraine subjects.
