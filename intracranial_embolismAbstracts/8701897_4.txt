We investigated the relation between the severity of mitral regurgitation and the development of complications and cardiac events by using two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography in 229 consecutive patients with mitral valve prolapse. The frequency of moderate and severe mitral regurgitation was significantly higher in patients with a prolapsed posterior leaflet (61%) than in patients with a prolapsed anterior leaflet (25%), and the older the patient, the greater the severity of mitral regurgitation. The occurrence of complications, such as atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and chordal rupture, was significantly greater in prolapsed posterior leaflet cases than in prolapsed anterior leaflet cases, and the occurrence was closely associated with the degree of severity of mitral regurgitation. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of mitral regurgitation is a strong prognostic indicator for developing complications. Furthermore in a subgroup of 49 patients tracked for a mean of 4.8 years, the new development of complications was significantly higher in patients who showed a progression in the severity of mitral regurgitation (52%) that in patients without progression in severity (8%). The initial severity of mitral regurgitation was related to the occurrence of cardiac events (mitral valve replacement, infective endocarditis, cerebral embolism and death). The data indicated that the progression of mitral regurgitation is closely associated with the development of complications and cardiac events and suggest that the severity of mitral regurgitation is an important prognostic indicator for the development of complications and cardiac events in patients with mitral valve prolapse.
