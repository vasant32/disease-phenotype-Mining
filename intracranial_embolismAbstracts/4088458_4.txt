A case of neoplastic aneurysm caused by left atrial myxoma is reported. The patient was a 50-year-old woman who has been suffered from occasional vertigo and syncopal attack. She was admitted with a sudden loss of consciousness and cerebellar ataxia on December 1, 1983. Cerebral angiogram revealed multiple aneurysms in the periphery of both middle cerebral arteries and obstruction of the right superior cerebellar artery. Echocardiography displayed a cardiac myxoma in the left atrium. She suddenly died from recurrent cerebral embolism on January 7, 1984. The diagnosis was confirmed by the autopsy. The histopathological examination revealed that the wall of cerebral arteries were destroyed by the tumor cells of myxoma, and it caused cerebral aneurysms. We presented the detail of this case, and discussed about a mechanism and a treatment of neoplastic aneurysms.
