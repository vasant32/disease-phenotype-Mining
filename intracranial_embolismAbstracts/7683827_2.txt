BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke following the intravenous injection of drugs may be secondary to the direct effect of the substance itself or from embolization by the inert vehicle used in the manufacturing process of the drug. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a 39-year-old man who developed a left homonymous hemianopia after intravenous injection of a melted suppository. CONCLUSIONS: Paradoxical fat embolism should be added to the possible list of stroke mechanisms in intravenous drug abusers.
