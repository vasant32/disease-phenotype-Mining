It has long been debated whether watershed infarcts are caused by hemodynamic or embolic mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated microembolic roles in the pathogenesis of watershed infarcts by examining MRI in a macaque monkey model of multiple microinfarcts. 50 Î¼m microbeads were injected into each internal carotid artery twice with a month interval. Monkeys (n=4) injected with 2250-2800 microbeads per unilateral side showed both cortical and internal watershed infarcts in the acute phase and atrophic changes with microbleeds in the chronic phase. These results suggest embolic pathogenesis can contribute to the genesis of both cortical and internal watershed infarcts in primates.
