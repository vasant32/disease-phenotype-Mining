 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Systemic air embolism is recognized as a rare but potentially fatal complication of trans-thoracic needle biopsy of the lung. Methods:â€‚ We report the case of a young female who developed fatal cerebral air embolism following computed tomography (CT) guided needle biopsy of a lung mass. RESULTS: Immediately after the procedure, the patient went into cardio-respiratory arrest. Despite adequate resuscitation and ventilatory support, she showed little recovery in her neurological status and subsequently died. CT scan of the brain confirmed cerebral arterial air embolism. CONCLUSION: Radiologists and physicians need to be aware of this rare but potentially fatal complication of needle lung biopsy.
