Fourteen symptomatic patients with severe extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis (> or = 70% of luminal narrowing) were monitored using long-term transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to determine the rate of clinically silent embolism of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. Before carotid endarterectomy (all patients being treated with intravenous heparin), 462 such events occurred during a total monitoring time of 45 h. Statistical analyses of the inter-event intervals and of the relationship between events and cardiac cycle revealed random occurrence. While the ipsilateral events were found in each subject, silent embolism of the contralateral middle cerebral artery occurred in only four patients each of whom had angiographically proven intracranial cross-flow from the symptomatic carotid territory (39 embolic events during 7 h monitoring time). The other 10 patients showed no contralateral embolism (10 h monitoring time). Five or more days (median 10 days) after surgery and cessation of intravenous anticoagulation the ipsilateral event rate had dropped to 13 in 33 h (P < 0.001) and the contralateral rate to zero. This suggests that the stenosed arterial segment is the main source of cerebral embolism detectable with ultrasound in symptomatic patients with high-grade internal carotid stenosis, and that carotid endarterectomy substantially reduces the rate of these events. Since reduction of ipsilateral stroke risk by successful endarterectomy is known to be of a similar degree in patients as those studied here, transcranially detected embolism may represent a new marker of disease activity of extracranial carotid artery stenosis.
