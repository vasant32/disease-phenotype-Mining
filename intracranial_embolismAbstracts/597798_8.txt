This presentation includes six cases of chronic bilateral pure motor hemiplegia, one of these with pathological findings; one clinical case of chronic pure motor quadriplegia and one pathologically-studied case of chronic pure motor paraplegia. These cases may illustrate a spectrum of pure corticospinal disorders that heretofore has not been fully recognized.
