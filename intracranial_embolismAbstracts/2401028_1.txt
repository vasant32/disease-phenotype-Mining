This article reports the curative effects of acupuncture on 6 acupoints of Yang meridian in treating 32 cases of cerebral infarction in comparison with another 31 cases treated with calan tablets 55 out of 63 patients have been diagnosed as cerebral infarction by computer tomography. Diagnosis of 8 cases relied on history, symptoms, signs together with cerebrospinal fluid examination. Patients were divided randomly into two treatment groups: acupuncture group and calan tablet group. Therapeutic method: (1) For acupuncture group, main acupoints consisted of Jianyu (L.I. 15), Quchi (I. I. 11), Hegu (L. I.4) in the upper extremity and Huantiao (G. B. 30), Yanglingquan (G. B. 34), Guangming (G. B. 37) in the lower extremity. According to the syndrome differentiation, Taichong (Liv. 3), Fengchi (G. B. 20), Tianshu (St. 25), Fenglong (St. 40), Zusanli (St. 36), Sanyinjiao (Sp. 6), Taixi (K. 3) were added. The lifting and thrusting was manipulated. The needles were retained for 30 minutes after the patient felt local sourness, distension and heaviness. Acupuncture was carried out every day for 6 weeks. (2) For calan tablet group, calan tablet 5 mg was administered 3 times a day for the same treatment session as the former group. Result: The total effective rates were 93. 75% and 83.87% respectively. The therapeutic effect in the acupuncture group was much better than that in the calan tablet group (P less than 0.05). The majority of hemorheological indices of patients in two groups were obviously higher than those of the normal in the same age group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
