BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vital statistics show a sharp decline in stroke mortality since the late 1960s. It is not clear whether this has been associated with a decline in stroke incidence. METHODS: Since 1966 the Honolulu Heart Program has monitored the incidence and mortality of coronary heart disease and stroke in a target population of 11,136 men of Japanese ancestry living on Oahu. Trends were analyzed from January 1, 1969, through December 31, 1988. RESULTS: Of 7893 men aged 45 to 68 years and free of stroke at entry examination, 530 developed first episodes of stroke in the period 1969 to 1988 (389 cases of thromboembolic stroke, 124 cases of hemorrhagic stroke, and 17 cases of stroke of unknown type). Age-adjusted annual stroke incidence declined from 5.1 per 1000 person-years in 1969 to 1972 to 2.4 in 1985 to 1988. The incidences of thromboembolic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and total stroke decreased 3.5%, 4.2%, and 4.4% per year, respectively. The 1-month case-fatality rates for thromboembolic stroke decreased moderately; those for hemorrhagic stroke fell dramatically. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the decline in stroke mortality in the past two or three decades results from a decline in both incidence rates and early case-fatality rates in thromboembolic and hemorrhagic stroke and stroke of unknown type. The decreases may be related to changes in risk factors, such as the decline in blood pressure and the decrease in cigarette smoking, as well as improvements in diagnosis and treatment.
