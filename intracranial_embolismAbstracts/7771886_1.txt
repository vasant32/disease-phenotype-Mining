Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty is a non-surgical procedure for treating mitral stenosis. There are two techniques of performing this procedure, the double balloon and the Inoue techniques. The aim of this study was to compare the immediate complications of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty in two consecutive series of unselected patients undergoing the double balloon (131 patients) and the Inoue (131 patients) techniques. The two series were comparable before valvuloplasty with respect to demographic, clinical, echocardiographic and haemodynamic criteria. The increase in valvular surface area and the decrease in pressure gradient after valvuloplasty were not significantly different (1.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.95 +/- 0.5 cm2 in the Inoue series and 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.95 +/- 0.5 cm2 in the double-balloon series; 12 +/- 3 to 5 +/- 2 mmHg in the Inoue series and 13 +/- 4 to 5 +/- 2 mmHg in the double-balloon series for the mean transvalvular pressure gradient). A good immediate result was defined as a valve surface are > 1.5 cm2 and < or = 2 + mitral regurgitation after the series, and this was obtained in 78% of cases in both series. Severe mitral regurgitation (3 +) requiring immediate or elective mitral valve replacement was observed in 7 cases in the Inoue series and in 5 cases in the double-balloon series (NS). One cerebral embolism occurred in the double balloon series and two systemic embolisms, one cerebral and one coronary, in the Inoue series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
