We present clinicopathologic findings in a patient treated with intraarterial thrombolysis and angioplasty for vertebrobasilar thrombosis. Autopsy revealed a marked inflammatory infiltrate within the vertebral artery at the site of catheter manipulation. This finding may have important implications for the use of interventional angiography in cerebrovascular disease.
