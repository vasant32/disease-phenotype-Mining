The paper deals with the possible mechanism in the development of a hemorrhagic brain infarction during myocardial infarction, complicated by a cardiogenic shock of the III degree. The results of a postmortal study of the brain, its major arteries, as well as the vessels of the Willis circle, permit to assume that the mechanism of realization of this cerebral vascular complication is in a joint metabolic and microcirculatory disorders accompanying the shock. Besides, there is also a stenosing atherosclerotic process, with prevalent lesion of the intracranial part of the magistral arteries, supplying the brain.
