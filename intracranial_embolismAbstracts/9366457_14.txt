BACKGROUND: Microemboli occur commonly during cardiac surgery in adults, and, when present, increase the risk of neuropsychological deficits. Their incidence and significance during correction of congenital heart disease is unknown. The authors hypothesized that microemboli would occur before bypass with right-to-left cardiac shunts and would also occur in large numbers when the aortic crossclamp was released in children during repair of congenital heart defects. METHODS: In 25 children studied with carotid artery Doppler, embolic signals were counted and timed in relation to 13 intraoperative events. Patients were classified as either at high risk (obligate right-to-left shunt or uncorrected transposition of the great arteries) or at low risk (net left-to-right shunt or simple obstructive lesions) for paradoxical (venous to arterial) emboli. RESULTS: The median number of emboli detected was 122 (range, 2-2,664). Forty-two percent of all emboli were detected within 3 min of release of the aortic crossclamp. The high-risk group had significantly more emboli (median, 66; range, 0-116) during the time interval before cardiopulmonary bypass than did the low-risk group (median, 8; range, 0-73), with P < 0.01. There was no significant difference between the high- and low-risk groups in the total number of emboli detected. There was no apparent association between number of emboli and gross neurologic deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Microemboli can be detected in the carotid arteries of children undergoing repair of congenital heart disease and are especially prevalent immediately after release of the aortic crossclamp. The role of emboli in causing neurologic injury in children undergoing repair of congenital heart disease remains to be determined.
