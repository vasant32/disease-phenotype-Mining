A young woman had cerebral embolism caused by an unusual complication of an asymptomatic cardiac hydatid cyst. The diagnosis of the cyst by means of echocardiography was confirmed by surgery as well as nuclear magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and serologic tests. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a thrombus in the left ventricle that was situated aside the cyst. It was thought to be the source of an embolus. Surgical removal of the cyst was successful. Cerebral damage was reduced by administration of heparin.
