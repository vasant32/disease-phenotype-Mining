Two patients with embolism from unruptured intracranial aneurysms are reported. These patients experienced cerebral ischemic attacks at the ages of 10 and 64 years, respectively. Angiography revealed normal extracranial vessels and middle cerebral artery aneurysms. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed intraaneurysmal clots and cerebral infarcts distal to the aneurysms. Aneurysmal neck clipping was carried out on the young patient. In the other case, the aneurysmal sac was excised, the intraluminal clot was removed, and the neck was closed with nylon sutures. These are the first cases of embolism from unruptured aneurysms in which magnetic resonance imaging revealed intraaneurysmal clots and cerebral infarcts distal to the aneurysms.
