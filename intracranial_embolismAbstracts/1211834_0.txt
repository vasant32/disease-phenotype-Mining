The results in the treatment of air embolism in open heart surgery are presented. Two cases of gaseous cerebral embolism are described. One of the patients had a period of unconsciousness of 54 hours, the other of 17 days. Therapy included administration of vasoactive drugs (xanthinol nicotinate 1500 mg 2 times daily as an intravenous drip) combined with superficial hypothermia (32 degrees C). In both cases complete recovery was achieved.
