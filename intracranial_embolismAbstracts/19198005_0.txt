Major stroke is a potentially devastating complication of carotid artery revascularization. Carotid artery stenting, unlike endarterectomy, offers the opportunity to attenuate this complication by allowing for the instantaneous detection and early endovascular treatment of neurologic defects complicating the procedure. We report a case that highlights the utility of aggressive endovascular cerebral rescue during a carotid artery stent procedure.
