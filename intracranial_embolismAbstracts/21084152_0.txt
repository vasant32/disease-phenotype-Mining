The purpose of this study was to reveal the cause of frequency modulation (FM) present in microembolic Doppler ultrasound signals. This novel explanation should help the development of sensitive microembolus discrimination techniques. We suggest that the frequency modulation detected is caused by the ultrasonic radiation force (URF) acting directly on microemboli. The frequency modulation and the imposed displacement were calculated using a numerical dynamic model. By setting simulation parameters with practical values, it was possible to reproduce most microembolic frequency modulation signatures. The most interesting findings in this study were that: (1) the ultrasound radiation force acting on a gaseous microembolus and its corresponding cumulative displacement were far higher than those obtained for a solid microembolus, and that is encouraging for discrimination purposes; and 2) the calculated frequency modulation indices (FMIs) (â‰ˆ20 kHz) were in good agreement with literature results. By taking into account the URF, the flow pulsatility, the beam-to-flow angle and both the velocity and the ultrasound beam profiles, it was possible to explain all erratic FM signatures of a microbubble. Finally, by measuring FMI from simulated Doppler signals and by using a constant threshold of 1 KHz, it was possible to discriminate gaseous from solid microemboli with ease.
