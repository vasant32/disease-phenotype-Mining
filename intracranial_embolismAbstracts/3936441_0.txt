Between September 1979 and December 1982, 56 St Jude Medical valvular prostheses were implanted in 54 patients over 65 years of age. Surgery consisted in simple aortic valve replacement (35 cases), simple mitral valve replacement (12 cases), double aortic and mitral valve replacement (2 cases), valve replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery (3 cases), aortic valve replacement and replacement of the ascending aorta (1 case) and mitral valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty (1 case). The operative mortality (within 30 days of surgery) was 3.5% (2 cases). Patients were assessed by clinical examination, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram and laboratory investigations on average 19 months after surgery. There were 3 late deaths (1 endocarditis, 1 cardiac failure and 1 subdural haematoma). No cases of significant haemolysis were observed. There were no cases of thrombosis of the valve or any deaths directly related to the valve. Four patients had cerebral embolism (4.9% per patient/year). None were fatal and only 1 patient had sequellae. Clinical improvement was very significant; 96% of the patients are now in the NYHA Classes I and II whilst 80% were in Class III or IV before surgery. The cardiothoracic ratio decreased significantly from 0.56 to 0.51 (p less than 0.01). The authors conclude that elderly patients may derive great benefits from valvular cardiac surgery and that age in itself is not a contraindication to this type of surgery. The St Jude Medical prosthesis is an excellent prosthesis but thromboembolism remains a major problem as with other mechanical prostheses. Anticoagulation for life is essential.
