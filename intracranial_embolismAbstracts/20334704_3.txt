OBJECTIVES: Stroke is a devastating complication after coronary artery bypass grafting, occurring in 1.4% to 4.3% of patients. A major cause of stroke is cerebral embolization of aortic atheromatous debris or calcified plaques. This report analyzes the incidence of stroke in patients treated according to the clampless concept, i.e. avoiding side-clamping of the aorta, by means of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) in combination with the HEARTSTRING device. METHODS: During a period of 43 months (2005-2008), 412 consecutive patients were treated with the above-mentioned method by one single surgeon. A minimum of one proximal aortal anastomosis was performed in each patient. Altogether, 542 proximal anastomosis were applied, each created by means of the HEARTSTRING device. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 67+9.7 years, the predicted mortality 5.2% (logistic EuroSCORE) and the observed mortality 1.9%. Histories of preoperative neurological disorders or cerebrovascular diseases were documented in 15% of patients. The overall incidence of postoperative stroke was 0.48% in contrast to 1.3% according to the stroke risk score. CONCLUSIONS: In accordance to previously published data, our results show that avoiding aortic side-clamping during OPCAB reduces postoperative stroke rates. The HEARTSTRING device is a safe option for creating proximal aortic anastomosis.
