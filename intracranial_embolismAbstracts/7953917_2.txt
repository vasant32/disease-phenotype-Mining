Epidemiological survey was conducted, according to diagnostic standard from WHO-MONICA project, on stroke events in 16 provinces of China. There were significant differences in geographical distribution of morbidity and mortality of stroke events. The morbidity and mortality were higher in northern China than in southern China (P < 0.001). The differences of morbidity varied from 11 to 14 times. The morbidity and mortality were higher in man than in woman (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) and were higher in rural areas than in cities. The geographical differences in the morbidity and mortality for stroke may be related to many factors, and may be in parallel with the hypertension prevalence rate, which was higher in northern China than in Southern China. The age of patients with stroke was younger in northern China than in southern China (P < 0.01). The frequency of cerebral hemorrhage was higher in southern China than in northern China.
