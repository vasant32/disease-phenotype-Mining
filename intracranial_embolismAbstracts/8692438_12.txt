We report three patients with bacterial intracranial aneurysms treated by the endovascular approach: two presented with sudden severe neurological deficits after a diagnosis of endocarditis; the other had suspected vasculitis. CT showed an intracerebral haematoma in all cases; angiography revealed bacterial aneurysms of distal branches of the middle cerebral artery in one. Because of the patients' condition and the location of the aneurysms, endovascular treatment was considered the fastest and safest treatment. Hyperselective catheterisation of the parent branch, close to the aneurysm, was performed with a microcatheter. A small amount of glue was injected to occlude both the aneurysm and a short segment of the diseased vessel. Follow-up angiography revealed occlusion of the aneurysm in all cases. One patient recovered completely; one recovered over some months, with neurological deficit due to the haematoma. The third patient suddenly worsened and died 9 days after treatment for a contralateral haematoma, due to rupture of a new bacterial aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery. Endovascular occlusion of the aneurysm and parent vessel may be an alternative to surgery in selected, severe cases of deep or distal bacterial intracranial aneurysms.
