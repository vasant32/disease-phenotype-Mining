According to a recently reported study, anticoagulant therapy appears to be ineffective in thrombotic cerebrovascular disease when viewed from the standpoint of mortality, although it does control thrombosis in animals, recurrent ischemic attacks and progression of infarction in patients with stuttering strokes. The efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in preventing a catastrophic stroke is analyzed in the present report. Of 92 untreated patients followed up for an average period of 36 months, 28 suffered a recurrent stroke, only two of these being trivial. One trivial and 12 catastrophic strokes occurred in the first 16 months. Of 103 patients treated with anticoagulants for an average period of 16 months, seven had recurrent strokes, but five of these were trivial. In the first 16 months one catastrophic and four trivial strokes occurred. Anticoagulant therapy appears to be useful in preventing catastrophic strokes in selected patients in whom the risk of recurrent strokes justifies the risks involved in this treatment.
