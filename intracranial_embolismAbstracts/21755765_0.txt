We present a case report of cerebral and spinal air embolism following percutaneous nephrolithotomy in a patient without evidence of intra-cardiac defects or prepulmonary A-V shunts. The position of the patient during the incidence determined the site of eventual lodgement of air emboli in the arterial circulation. We suspect that the time of onset of symptoms following the procedure may be the clue to the path followed by air emboli.
