There are many extra-intestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), some which are very uncommon in the pediatric age group. Coagulation abnormalities occur infrequently. Both hypercoagulability and hypocoagulability have been reported in adults (1). The hypercoagulable state is reflected in a general increase in concentration of clotting factors. This is observed most frequently in patients with poorly controlled intestinal disease and can lead to thromboembolic phenomena, including pulmonary and cerebral embolism. Conversely, patients with hypocoagulability may present with bleeding manifestations. We report a young patient with an abnormal coagulation profile as well as with thrombocytopenia in association with IBD.
