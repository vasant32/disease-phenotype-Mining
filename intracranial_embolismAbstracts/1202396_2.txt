Catalase-like activity was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid of 16 patients with cerebral haemorrhage, 24 cases od encephalomalacia due to thrombosis, and 10 controls. It was demonstrated that catalase-like activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with cerebral stroke is significantly raised in relation to the activity observed in controls. This rise is patricularly evident in the first 24 hours after the onset. The rise was statistically significant only in the group of encephalomalacia.
