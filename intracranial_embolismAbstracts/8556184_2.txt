Valvular tumors are uncommon and usually benign lesions, discovered accidentally or when neurological or cardiological complications occur. We report a case of mitral valve papillary fibroelastoma measuring less than 1 cm and revealed by stroke. Transesophageal echocardiography was the best method to establish the diagnosis as it provided higher discriminative power than the transthoracic echocardiography or nuclear magnetic resonance. The embolic risks justify the surgical treatment of these lesions while anticoagulation therapy can be suggested as a substitute to surgery for the high risk patients.
