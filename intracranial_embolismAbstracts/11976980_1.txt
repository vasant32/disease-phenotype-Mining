Fibroelastoma is an infrequent tumor affecting mainly cardiac valves. Before echocardiography, it was an occasional autoptic finding. With the development of ultrasonographic techniques, it is currently possible to carry out diagnosis in vivo. We report the case of a young woman with cerebral ischemia who was successfully treated by intra-arterial fibrinolysis with complete clinical resolution. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified a papillary fibroelastoma on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Surgical excision of the tumor was performed. Sudden cerebral or peripheral embolization is frequently linked to thrombotic material which surrounds the neoplasm, and thus can be successfully treated with local fibrinolysis.
