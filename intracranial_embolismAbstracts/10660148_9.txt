OBJECTIVES: To compare the occurrence of lacunar infarcts in the very elderly ( > or = 85 years of age) and in patients below 85. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 374 consecutive patients with lacunar infarcts were collected from a prospective hospital-based stroke registry in which 2000 patients are included. Distinctive clinical features of lacunar infarct in the very elderly were assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Lacunar infarcts were diagnosed in 39 (15%) of the 262 very elderly patients of our stroke registry. Lacunar infarcts in the very elderly accounted for 10.5% of all lacunes. There was no statistical difference in the occurrence of different lacunar syndromes between the very elderly patients and patients below 85. However, the very old group with lacunar infarct showed a significantly higher proportion of the female sex (56.4% vs 37.3%) and history of atrial fibrillation (28.2% vs 8.7%), chronic renal disease and pathologic condition and a significantly lower proportion of hypertension (61.5% vs 77.3%), diabetes (7.7%) vs 28.4%), ischemic heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, and absence of neurologic deficit at discharge from the hospital than patients below 85. After multivariate analysis only atrial fibrillation (OR = 3.77), female gender (OR =2.52), hypertension (OR = 0.35), and diabetes (OR = 0.16) were independent clinical factors for developing lacunar infarction in the very elderly. CONCLUSION: In the very elderly the higher occurrence of atrial fibrillation, the lower prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and the greater focal neurological impairment suggest that the cardioembolic pathogenetic mechanisms may be more frequent than generally established for lacunar infarcts in stroke patients.
