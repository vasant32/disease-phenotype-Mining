BACKGROUND: Arteriosclerotic plaques of the ascending aorta and transverse arch increase the operative risk of cardiac operations and are strong predictors for late cerebrovascular events. METHODS: Twenty-two patients, mean age 68 +/- 6 years (range, 55 to 77 years), with grade IV + V plaques of the ascending aorta and transverse arch underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 21) and aortic valve replacement (n = 8). Cerebrovascular emboli from unknown sources were found preoperatively in 8 patients (36%). All were in sinus rhythm. Complete thromboendarterectomy of the ascending aorta and transverse arch was performed during hypothermic circulatory arrest. After 21 +/- 12 months (range, 4 to 44 months), magnetic resonance imaging and transthoracic echocardiography of endarterectomized vessels was performed. RESULTS: There was one perioperative death (4.5%), one early (4.5%), and one late (4.7%) adverse neurologic event. Follow-up examinations revealed normal diameters of the endarterectomized aorta. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with grade IV + V plaques, thromboendarterectomy of the ascending aorta and transverse arch can be performed with an acceptable surgical risk and a low recurrence rate for cerebrovascular events. Dilatation of the endarterectomized aorta was not observed.
