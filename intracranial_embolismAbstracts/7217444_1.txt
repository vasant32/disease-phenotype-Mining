Four cases of cerebral emboli diagnosed on computed tomography as foci of increased density are discussed. The emboli were calcified in at least two cases. Both cardiac and carotid sources contributed dense emboli, which were seen to lodge at typical scan sites: near the anterior cerebral artery bifurcation (two cases) and in the middle cerebral artery horizontal segment-trifurcation region (two cases).
