Cerebral internal venous thrombosis are rare and diagnosis is difficult. We report three cases in male adults. Clinical data were headaches, vomiting, dizziness and coma, in relation with an intracranial hypertension, or in a case, cardiocirculatory arrest. Cerebral internal veinous thrombosis was diagnosed by a CT scan and cerebral angiography twenty four hours after the admission in neurosurgical intensive care. CT scan showed hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions of thalami in two cases, diffuse cerebral edema in two patients, early or delayed hydrocephaly in two cases. No patient survived despite intensive treatment including heparinotherapy, ventricular CSF drainage, osmotherapy, dehydration, barbiturate, other antiepileptic drugs and mechanical ventilation. In two cases, general or local illness was found, sickle cell disease or radiotherapy for pineal tumor, and in case 3 clinical signs evoked autoimmune disease, not demonstrated by biological samples.
