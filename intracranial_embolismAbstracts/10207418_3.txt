An unusual case of lipid embolization to brain and kidney after lymphography in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the upper anterior mediastinum is reported. Contrast material-enhanced echocardiography demonstrated a right-to-left shunt to the left atrium without evidence of a patent foramen ovale. Echo contrast particles were transiently present within the tumor surrounding the great vessels.
