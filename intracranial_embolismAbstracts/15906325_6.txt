PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of map-ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique) to classify the different categories of ischemic damage in the lesion and to evaluate a combined (thrombolysis plus antiplatelet) treatment efficacy in an embolic stroke of rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats subjected to embolic stroke with (N=12) and without (N=10) rt-PA and 7E3 F(ab')2 treatment (4 hours after embolization) were followed (at 2, 24, and 48 hours post-MCAO) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using T1, T2, and apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw). ISODATA was computed from T1, T2, and ADCw maps. The signatures characterized by the map-ISODATA were compared with histological quantitative evaluation and were employed to demarcate the specific regions in the lesion. RESULTS: The signature described by map-ISODATA is highly correlated with the degree of tissue damage in the lesion and can distinguish the severity of ischemic tissue injury. Based upon map-ISODATA, ischemic lesion area can be divided into three specific regions, each characterized by a distinct evolution of injury and treatment response. The combined treatment significantly reduces the lesion size between 24 and 48 hours and improves the outcome 48 hours post-MCAO compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Map-ISODATA provides an accurate means to identify lesion area, to distinguish ischemic damage, and to detect treatment response. 7E3 F(ab')2 extends the rt-PA treatment window to at least four hours after the onset of embolic stroke of rat.
