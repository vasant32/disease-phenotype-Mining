A case of antiphospholipid syndrome (APPS) is presented. A 33-year-old female presented with a right hemispheric stroke secondary to thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery. Shortly thereafter, she developed thrombosis of the right brachial artery. Despite thrombolytic therapy, progressive occlusion of this artery occurred as demonstrated by a follow-up angiogram. The patient had a history of multiple recurrent spontaneous abortions. Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and VDRL were positive on two different occasions. The angiographic findings of multiple and progressive arterial thrombosis in young women should alert the angiographer to the possibility of APPS.
