Heparin-induced Extracorporeal LDL < total cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen > Precipitation (H.E.L.P.) was applied in cases of acute thromboembolic stroke within 48 to 96 hours after onset. 42 patients had been randomized for the trial. In Group A 12 patients underwent a single H.E.L.P. application, while remaining 10 patients formed a control group. In group B 10 patients had 10 H.E.L.P. applications, the other 10 patients firmed as controls. Results of group A: 4 days after H.E.L.P. an improvement in the Mathew Scale and in the Mini Mental State Examination could be obtained (p < 0.05 each). 10 days after H.E.L.P. all the tests showed significant changes (p < 0.05 in the Mathew Scale and in the Mini Mental State Examination and p < 0.01 in the Activities-of-Daily-Living Score). Relatet to the controls there appeared a statistically significant difference 4 days after H.E.L.P. in the Mini Mental State Examination and in the Activities-of-Daily-Living Score (p < 0.05 each). At day 10 all the tests showed a difference to the controls (p < 0.05 in the Mathew Scale and p < 0.01 in the other tests). Results of group B 10: One day after 1st H.E.L.P. a statistically significant difference could be observed in all the tests (p < 0.05 in the Mathew Scale and the Mini Mental State Examination and p < 0.01 in the Activities-of-Daily-Living Score). At that time even a difference to the controls became visible (p < 0.05 in the Mathew scale, p < 0.01 in the other tests).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
