A giant aneurysm of the left vertebral artery which was nearly completely thrombosed and very difficult to diagnose, was successfully treated by a complete surgical excision. The patient had been hospitalized eight times because of brief episodes of headache associated with neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting and numbness of the left hand. On the ninth admission, the diagnosis of a "tumour" involving the posterior fossa was established. At operation an aneurysm of the left vertebral artery was found and resected. At discharge, one week after surgery, the patient was free of neurologic deficits.
