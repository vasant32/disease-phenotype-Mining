Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of the internal carotid arteries and its relationship with focal cerebral ischaemia is unproven. This vasculopathy is often detected incidentally during a cerebral angiogram for non-ischaemic cerebral events. FMD affects the proximal one-third of the internal carotid artery in almost all cases and is bilateral in 60% to 85%, with middle-aged women affected in 85% of the cases. Ischaemic stroke has been postulated to result from severe stenosis or thrombotic occlusion at the FMD site. Cerebral embolism from FMD has rarely been reported. We report 3 young patients with acute ischaemic stroke who had FMD on cerebral angiography. They presented with a focal hemispheric stroke where the probable pathophysiology is embolism to the distal internal carotid artery from thrombus formed at the proximal FMD site. The patients were all males, with unilateral proximal internal carotid artery FMD lesions and occlusion of the internal carotid artery distally on the same side. All were extensively investigated and no other causes for stroke were found.
