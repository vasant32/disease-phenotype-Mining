The case of a 38-year-old female who suffered a cerebral embolism from a free left atrial thrombus is reported. The clinical picture, including serum enzyme elevations, was consistent with a nontransmural myocardial infarction. Atrial flutter exhibiting very slow (162/min) and tall waves was transiently recorded indicating development of an intra-atrial conduction disturbance.
