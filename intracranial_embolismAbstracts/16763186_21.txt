BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A 6-point scoring system (ABCD) was described recently for stratifying risk after transient ischemic attack (TIA). This score incorporates age (A), blood pressure (B), clinical features (C), and duration (D) of TIA. A score <4 reportedly indicates minimal short-term stroke risk. We evaluated this scoring system in an independent population. METHODS: This was a prospective study of TIA patients (diagnosed by a neurologist using the classic <24-hour definition) hospitalized <48 hours from symptom onset. The primary outcome assessment consisted of dichotomization of patients into 2 groups. The high-risk group included patients with stroke or death within 90 days, > or =50% stenosis in a relevant artery, or a cardioembolic source warranting anticoagulation. All others were classified as low risk. Findings on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) were also evaluated when performed and patients classified as DWI+ or DWI-. RESULTS: Over 3 years, 117 patients were enrolled. Median time from symptom onset to enrollment was 25.2 hours (interquartile range 19.8 to 30.2). Overall, 26 patients (22%) were classified as high risk, including 2 strokes, 2 deaths, 15 with > or =50% stenosis, and 10 with cardioembolic source. The frequency of high-risk patients increased with ABCD score (0 to 1 13%; 2 8%; 3 17%; 4 27%; 5 26%; 6 30%; P for trend=0.11). ABCD scores in the 2 patients with stroke were 3 and 6. Of those who underwent MRI, 15 of 61 (25%) were DWI+, but this correlated poorly with ABCD score (0 to 1 17%; 2 10%; 3 36%; 4 24%; 5 13%; 6 60%; P for trend=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Although the ABCD score has some predictive value, patients with a score <4 still have a substantial probability of having a high-risk cause of cerebral ischemia or radiographic evidence of acute infarction despite transient symptoms.
