Georg Friedrich HÃ¤ndel, a musical genius, was affected since his middle age by several attacks, during a period of 20 years, of upper right limb palsies, abnormal speech followed by amaurosis in his contralateral eye and then is both eyes. He underwent three unsuccessful operations due to a wrong diagnosis of cataracts. We discuss the possible differential diagnoses. Considering his clear vascular profile, the most plausible hypothesis is cerebrovascular disease with embolic infarcts from stenotic left internal carotid artery to the left middle cerebral and retinal arteries.
