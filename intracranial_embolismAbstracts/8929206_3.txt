We present the case of a helicopter pilot who suffered an arterial gas embolism following instruction in the use of the Short Term Air Supply System (STASS) at a depth of 1 m of water. This is believed to be the shallowest depth from which a case of arterial gas embolism associated with the use of compressed air breathing apparatus has been reported.
