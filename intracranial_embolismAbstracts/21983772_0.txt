Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare cardiac disorder. Although left ventricular apical thrombus formation is common in peripartum cardiomyopathy, biventricular apical thrombi formation is a very rare condition in these patients. A 21-year-old woman presented with complaints of dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and palpitations that appeared three months after labor. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe global hypokinesis, decreased left and right ventricular ejection fraction (left 30%, right 35%), increased left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (60 mm), grade 2 mitral regurgitation, and biventricular apical thrombi. On the second day of admission, she developed global aphasia and right hemiplegia. The patient was successfully treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Transthoracic echocardiography following treatment showed disappearance of biventricular apical thrombi. She had no neurologic deficit. Treatment for heart failure was continued due to persistence of global hypokinesis and left ventricular dilatation.
