We present a case of a cervical internal carotid artery aneurysm that caused cerebral embolism. This lesion was supposed to be a dissecting aneurysm due to blunt neck injury. The large aneurysm with intramural thrombus was treated with endovascular placement of a balloon-expandable stent. Both CT and MRI were useful for evaluating the size and characteristics of the aneurysmal wall. Intravascular ultrasound imaging was also useful for evaluation of the satisfactory stent deployment and identification of the neck of the aneurysm. We discuss effectiveness of endovascular stenting for cervical internal carotid artery aneurysm with intramural thrombus and the usefulness of a combination of the neuroradiological imaging before, during and after the interventional procedure.
