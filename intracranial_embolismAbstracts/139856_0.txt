This study reports on two more cases of left atrial myxoma. They were two women with embolic manifestation for several years and in whom the diagnosis was not clinically considered. It was made by echocardiography. Emergency surgery was applied in both cases one of whom without hemodynamic study. The presence of a recent brain embolism did not seem to us to be a contraindication to this surgery. In both cases the tumoral pedicle was implanted on the posterior wall of the left atrium, an unusual location.
