Since the acute revascularization was adopted as a probable means of surgical treatment for the acute cerebral ischemia, it became essential to discuss how the initial symptom at onset can predict the subsequent development of severe or mild cerebral infarction. In the 2 past years, 207 cases of cerebral ischemic lesion were admitted non-selectively and mostly in the early stage after the attack. Excluding 40 cases of surgical treatment, 167 cases were classified into 30 cases of TIA, 13 cases of RIND, 94 cases of minor completed stroke and 30 cases of major completed stroke. In 30 cases of major completed stroke, 21 cases developed severe motor hemiplegia from the onset and the rest 9 cases initially mild hemiparesis which gradually developed to severe hemiplegia thereafter. The cases of minor completed stroke showed mild or moderate hemiparesis initially and did not worsen thereafter. In the group of TIA and RIND, no case had developed severe hemiplegia in any stage of clinical course. The disturbance of consciousness were noted in 5 cases out of 94 cases of minor completed stroke (5%) and 12 cases out of 30 cases of major completed stroke (40%) in the following time course. More than half of the cases of major completed stroke were considered to be cerebral embolism including the retrospective review.
