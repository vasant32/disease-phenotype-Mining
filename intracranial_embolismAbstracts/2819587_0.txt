The clinical and radiographic features of cerebral deep venous thrombosis in a 21-year-old white woman are presented. This nulliparous patient presented with relatively mild clinical symptoms and progressing mental status changes. The only known risk factor was "low-dose" oral contraceptive pills. The magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed increased signal intensity from the internal cerebral veins, vein of Galen, and straight sinus. The diagnosis was confirmed by arterial angiography.
