BACKGROUND: Neurologic impairment after coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with cerebral embolization. An important cause of embolism is aortic manipulation. Constructing both distal and proximal anastomoses during a single period of aortic cross-clamping avoids this source of embolism and may reduce neurologic injury after coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were prospectively randomized to group 1, in which a single aortic cross-clamping was used to construct distal and proximal anastomoses, or to group 2, in which the proximal anastomoses were each constructed with a partial occluding aortic clamp. Levels of S-100 and troponin-T release were measured preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: Aortic cross-clamp time was significantly longer in group 1, but other preoperative and intraoperative variables were equally represented in both groups. Control group levels of S-100 and troponin-T were similar. Postoperative S-100 levels were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 (p < 0.015). No significant difference was found between the groups in postoperative troponin-T levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial suggest improved cerebral protection is associated with the single aortic cross-clamp technique for coronary artery bypass grafting with no increase in myocardial damage. The single aortic cross-clamp technique is simple and inexpensive. We recommend its wider use.
