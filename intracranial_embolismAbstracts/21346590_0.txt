Elective surgery cannot be recommended in every patient with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, and predictors identifying high-risk patients need to be identified. In guidelines we read that elective surgery, at the asymptomatic stage, can only be recommended in selected patients, at low operative risk (see guidelines of European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association), but we have not read any reference to patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis after symptomatic spontaneous calcium cerebral embolism. Because cardioembolic stroke is associated with poor prognosis compared to other stroke subtypes, in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis and spontaneous calcific embolic stroke valve replacement appears to offer the best hope of avoiding a recidivation of stroke and should be considered in most cases. On the contrary, is it still correct to consider as asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and cerebral thromboembolism from a calcified aortic valve?
