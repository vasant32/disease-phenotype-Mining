OBJECTIVE: To report the initial application of brain protection device in the dilatation and stenting of atherosclerotic stenosis of the carotid and vertebral artery. METHODS: Eighteen patients with 21 atherosclerotic stenoses of the carotid or vertebral artery underwent dilatation and/or stenting with brain protection device (filterwire or angioguard). The clinical results were summarized and the indispensability and feasibility of the device was discussed. RESULTS: With the aid of brain protection device, endovascular dilatation and (or) stenting were performed in all the patients with 21 stenoses of the carotid or vertebral artery. The interventional manipulation was successful and no complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Brain protection device is helpful to decrease the embolic complication caused by atherosclerotic plaque and thromboembolus and to increase the security of interventional therapy, during the dilatation and/or stenting of stenosis of the carotid or vertebral artery.
