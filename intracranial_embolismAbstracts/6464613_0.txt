Study of the blood coagulation system (BCS) in 108 patients revealed the following regular features: before and in the first 24 hours after removal of the compression the coagulation of blood was reduced, which led to hemorrhagic complications and recurrence of the hematoma in occasional cases. Hypercoagulation of blood developed in the next days, which was conducive to the occurrence of thromboembolic and inflammatory complications. Anticoagulation therapy produced good results from the 3rd-4th postoperative day and made it possible to reduce the incidence of these complications and to remove them.
