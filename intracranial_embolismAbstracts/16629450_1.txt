We report a 63-year-old case of the vertebral artery dissection with recurrent brain embolisms. She was admitted to the hospital because she suffered a visual symptom. She was examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnosed a left vertebral artery (VA) dissection. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed the string sign on the left VA supporting the evidence of dissection. However, after DSA, multiple brain embolic stroke was occurred. She was treated with anti-platelet drug (sodium ozagrel), then, recanalization of the pseudo-lumen at the dissecting lesion was observed by MRI examination. Anti-platelet medicine (cilostazol) was taken for preventing reattack although the dissecting lesion was not closed. Following 4 weeks, brain embolisms were observed in the posterior circulation system. MRI revealed a dilated pseudo-lumen at the dissecting lesion with recurrent VA. This time, she was treated only with free radical scavenger (edarabone). After the occlusion of the dissected VA was observed, she started to take anti-platelet medicine again. It is generally accepted to use anti-platelet drug or anti-coagulant drug as a treatment of VA dissection causing brain ischemia. However, it should be assessed more carefully in cases showing recanalization of the pseudo-lumen as observed in this case. Surgical treatments should be taken into consideration at the early stage, especially for the cases presenting fragile dissecting lesions. Further study need to decide the effective treatment of the vertebral artery dissection.
