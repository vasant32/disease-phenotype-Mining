Pregnancy in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome is known to be associated with a high incidence of maternal and perinatal death. Complications can occur before and during parturition but are most hazardous in the early postpartum period. If the exact causes of maternal death remain in most instances unknown, hypovolemia with augmented pulmonary to systemic shunt, thromboembolism and cardiac arrythmias are often mentioned as the primary causes of mortality. We report the unsuccessful management of a pregnant patient with Eisenmenger's disease despite all possible precautions as reported in the literature had been taken. We discuss these precautions and more specifically the type of anesthesia that is best given, the prophylactic methods of anticoagulation and the benefit of monitoring techniques in the management of such complex pathologies.
