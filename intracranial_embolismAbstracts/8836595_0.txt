Two cases of cerebral venous thrombosis with ulcerative colitis with complete autopsy findings are reported. The diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis with ulcerative colitis was made during life in one case and at autopsy showed active chronic ulcerative colitis with recent cerebral venous thrombosis with cerebral infarction. In the other case active chronic ulcerative colitis and old cerebral venous thrombosis with cerebral infarction were diagnosed at autopsy. Although rare the importance of recognising cerebral venous thrombosis as a complication of ulcerative colitis has been emphasised in view of the high mortality of this complication.
