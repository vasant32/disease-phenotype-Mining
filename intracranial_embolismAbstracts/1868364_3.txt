A variable-interval spatial delayed alternation memory task was used to quantify the behavioral effects of photochemically induced thrombic infarction of the precentral (frontal) cortex. Upon achieving criterion on the behavioral task, rats received thrombicischemic lesions, predominantly limited to the medial precentral cortex, induced by injection of the fluorescein dye Rose Bengal and illumination of the skull above the target area. Beginning six days after surgery, rats were retested on the memory task. Compared to Sham-operated controls (n = 5), rats with precentral cortex lesions (n = 5) demonstrated a retention interval-dependent accuracy deficit (impaired at the longest retention interval only) and slower reaction time (increased response latency). These effects were significant only during the first week of postoperative testing. Rats with lesions also demonstrated a greater probability of a choice response throughout the three postoperative test weeks. The results suggest that photochemical thrombosis in the precentral cortex produces functional, behavioral consequences in rats which can be reliably and objectively measured.
