Although transmission and engraftment of donor-derived malignancies is rare in recipients of solid organ transplants, it is associated with unfavorable allograft and patient survival. Therefore, a recent history of malignancy is considered a contraindication to organ donation. Although atrial myxomas are benign cardiac tumors of stromal origin, they can lead to systemic embolization with ectopic myxoma formation. We report successful liver, kidney, and pancreas transplantation into 3 recipients from a donor with cerebral emboli from a left atrial myxoma. Eighteen months after transplantation, all 3 patients enjoy good allograft function and are free of donor-derived atrial myxoma. Although the duration of follow-up in this report is limited, we suggest that the presence of atrial myxoma should not be viewed as an absolute contraindication to organ recovery, particularly in view of the shortage of organ donors and the attendant morbidity and mortality for patients on waiting lists.
