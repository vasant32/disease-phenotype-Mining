This single case report describes a large (giant) left internal carotid aneurysm that showed a very marked decrease in the size of its lumen on reevaluation 5 days after the initial arteriogram. A review of the literature found only 5 cases of spontaneous thrombosis documented by arteriography and only one involved a giant aneurysm. Follow-up arteriography however, may show this rare occurrence and eliminate unwarranted surgery.
