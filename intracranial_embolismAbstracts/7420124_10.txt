A 48-year-old woman with triple cardiac valve prostheses became completely deaf after bitemporal embolism. The lesions were demonstrated radiologically and neurophysiological investigation confirmed intact peripheral and brainstem pathways. Experimental studies of the auditory pathways are briefly reviewed. Reported cases of cortical deafness are discussed and the rarity of the condition emphasised.
