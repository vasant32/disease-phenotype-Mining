Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is an antiplatelet agent which has been used in treatment and prevention of stroke in humans. In the present study, the effects of ASA on perfusion deficits in the brain have been studied in an embolic model of stroke. Data showed that perfusion deficits were observed in all rats sacrificed immediately after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Treatment with ASA significantly reduced perfusion deficits 1 h but not 3 h after the MCA occlusion. These findings thus support that ASA is useful agent in treatment and prevention of stroke, and show that its mechanism of action is likely through the reopening of cerebral microvessels.
