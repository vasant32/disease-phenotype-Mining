The arterial angioarchitecture of twenty post mortem brains, containing thirty infarctions, was examined by means of the translucidation technique after filling the arterial system with a collo√Ødal barium sulphate solution. Although the large as well as the small arteries and arterioles were filled to a variable degree in the infarcted areas, the angioarchitecture was generally severely affected. Their differences were compared in red and white softenings and in cases of thrombosis, embolism, hemodynamic disturbances and compression of arteries. Also the influence of arterial hypertension and of the age and the location of the infarction was determined.
