We evaluated parietal cortex (PCTX) involvement in learning a shock-motivated, 14-unit T-maize in young F344 rats. In Experiment 1, each rat was placed into a stereotaxic instrument, and the scalp was retracted before either the photosensitive dye, rose bengal, or saline (CON) was provided via a jugular catheter. After 60 s, halogen lamps were used to illuminate the cranium bilaterally over PCTX for 40 min to activate the dye and generate a thrombus in dye-injected rats. Active avoidance pretraining in a straight runway occurred 12 days after surgery. Each rat was provided acquisition (ACQ) trials in the 14-unit T-maze 24-h later. The PCTX rats were impaired relative to CON in errors, run time, alternation errors, and shock frequency measures in the 14-unit T-maze, but not in shock duration. The thrombosis extended to areas comprising anteromedial and posterior PCTX, and also into the striate cortex (SCTX). In Experiment 2, rats were divided into four groups: a PCTX group that received bilateral illumination; PCTX+SCTX and SCTX groups that were illuminated at midline; and a CON group that received the surgery and either dye or illumination. Only PCTX differed from CON, with maze performance similar to Experiment 1. The thrombosis for the PCTX group in Experiment 2 was confined to anteromedial and posterior PCTX. Thus, PCTX, but not SCTX, was implicated in ACQ of this maze task, suggesting that PCTX might be involved in the robust age-related impairments in ACQ previously observed.
