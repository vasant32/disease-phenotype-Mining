Fibrinolytic therapy may be effective in the treatment of ischemic stroke, and clinical trials are under way. We evaluated two fibrinolytic agents, an analogue of tissue plasminogen activator (Fb-Fb-CF, the catalytic fragment of the tissue plasminogen activator molecule with a prolonged serum half-life, n = 10) and streptokinase (n = 7), in a rabbit model of embolic stroke. Both agents were given 3 hours after stroke onset, a time relevant to the clinical setting. Fb-Fb-CF was significantly better (p less than 0.04) than saline (n = 7) in restoring blood flow to previously occluded intracranial arteries, but streptokinase was ineffective. Neither fibrinolytic agent was associated with a substantial risk for intracerebral hemorrhagic side effects. Our study demonstrates that Fb-Fb-CF can safely and effectively reperfuse rabbit intracranial arteries 3 hours after occlusion, while streptokinase does not.
