Hospital admissions for acute stroke were monitored over a twelve month period. Only patients age 20 and over were studied. Out of a population at risk of 114931 there were 116 cases, giving an overall incidence of 1.01 admissions per 1000 population per year over age 20. Cerebral hemorrhages were present in 32.8%, large artery thromboses in 31.9%, cerebral embolism in 13.8% and lacunar infarctions in 20.7% of cases. Atrial fibrillation was the presumed cause of cerebral embolism in 6.9% of patients. Hypertension was present in 69.8% of patients. Further studies are needed to establish the characteristics of stroke in the Third World.
