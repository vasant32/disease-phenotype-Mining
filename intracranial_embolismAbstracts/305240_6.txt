A 65-year-old man suffered a midbrain infarct after coronary artery bypass surgery. He was left with a severe neuro-ophthalmologic deficit consisting of paralysis of upward and downward vertical gaze, weakness of adduction of the left eye, a dilated fixed left pupil, and partial right Horner's syndrome. He died 31 months after the episode. Postmortem examination disclosed an infarct involving parts of both oculomotor nuclei as well as supranuclear structures thought to be involved in the mediation of vertical eye movements.
