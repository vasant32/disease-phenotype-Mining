A 31-year-old woman was admitted with recurrent pulmonary emboli. The patient subsequently developed right sided hemiplegia. A mobile left atrial mass attached to the interatrial septum was detected and paradoxical embolization was assumed to be the underlying cause of the cerebral event. Leg phlebography and B-mode ultrasonographic imaging showed that the most probable source of embolization was a right popliteal venous aneurysm containing thrombi adherent to the vein wall. The immediate treatment was restricted to full dose heparin therapy and supportive measures. Thirteen days after admission, the aneurysm was excised. Recovery was rapid and the patient was discharged for further rehabilitation with an only minimal neurological deficit 3 weeks after admission.
