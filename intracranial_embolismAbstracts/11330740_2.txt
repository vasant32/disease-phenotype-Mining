We describe a technique for transapical cannulation in cases of acute aortic dissection. This method entails aortic cannulation via the apex of the left ventricle and the aortic valve. When this technique is used, retrograde perfusion prevents such fatal complications as malperfusion or cerebral embolism that can occur with femoral cannulation. Having found no disadvantage in this method, we recommend transapical cannulation as the best cannulation technique for acute aortic dissection.
