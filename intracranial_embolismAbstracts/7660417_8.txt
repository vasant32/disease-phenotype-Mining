BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated an association between mitral annular calcification and stroke; however, the pathophysiological explanation remains speculative. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We describe two patients with cerebral embolism in whom mitral valve calcification was demonstrated by transthoracic echocardiography. In both patients, transesophageal echocardiography identified a mass that appeared to be thrombus on the calcified portion of the mitral apparatus. There was no evidence of a hypercoagulable state or endocarditis in either case. Repeated transesophageal echocardiography after anticoagulation demonstrated resolution of the masses in both patients. CONCLUSIONS: These cases support the hypothesis that thrombus formation may be a pathophysiological link between ischemic cerebral events and mitral annular calcification in some patients.
