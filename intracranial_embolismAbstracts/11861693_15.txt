 OBJECTIVES: The aim was to estimate the recurrence rate and to define subgroups at increased risk for recurrent cerebral ischaemia in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and so called cryptogenic stroke due to paradoxical embolism. METHODS: Patent foramen ovale was diagnosed in 318 patients with otherwise unexplained ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). One hundred and fifty nine were treated medically (oral anticoagulation 79, platelet inhibitors 80) and represent the study population. The remaining 159 patients underwent endovascular or surgical closure of the PFO and are not part of this study. RESULTS: Mean age was 50.7 (SD 13.5) years. The event leading to the diagnosis of PFO was a TIA in 38 patients (23.9%), an ischaemic stroke in 119 (74.8%), and an amaurosis fugax in two patients (1.3%). Forty four patients (27.7%) had experienced multiple cerebrovascular ischaemic events before the diagnosis of the PFO. During mean follow up of 29 (SD 23) months 21 patients (13.4%) had a recurrent cerebrovascular event (seven strokes and 14 TIAs). The average annual rate of recurrent strokes was 1.8% and that of recurrent strokes or TIAs was 5.5%. When patients with PFO with multiple cerebrovascular events before the diagnosis of the PFO were analyzed separately, the average annual rates of recurrent cerebral ischaemia were 3.6% for recurrent strokes and 9.9% for recurrent strokes or TIAs. These rates were significantly higher than in patients with first ever stroke or TIA (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms a risk of stroke recurrence that is similar to the rates of previously published series of patients with PFO and cryptogenic strokes. Patients with more than one previous event were at increased risk of recurrent cerebral ischaemia.
