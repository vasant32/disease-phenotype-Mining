In this article, the therapeutic effects of acupuncture and routine drugs in treating 20 cases of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and in comparison with another 20 cases treated with sole routine drugs were studied. Effects of acupuncture were evaluated from the degree of functional nervous damage, EEG-map and somatosensory evoked potential. After treatment the results were as follows: the marks of functional nervous damage in the test group were reduced 13.0 average, but only 3.75 in the control group. There was a very remarkable difference between these two groups (P less than 0.001). Slow wave of the EEG-map in the test group were reduced 1.70 level average, but only 0.05 in the control group (P less than 0.001). theta wave of the EEG-map in the test group were reduced 1.05 level average, but only 0.25 level in the control group (P less than 0.001). The diversity of latent period of P45 peak wave value between left limbs and right limbs were reduced evidently in the test group and showed a very significant statistical difference. (P less than 0.05) as compared with the control group. The above results revealed that therapeutic effects of acupuncture were objective and were based on neurophysiological mechanism.
