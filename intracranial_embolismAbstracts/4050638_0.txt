It is difficult to determine the significance of nonstenotic carotid bifurcation plaques in patients with ischemic cerebral symptoms. Plaque ulcerations may be associated with platelet/fibrin embolism. Hemorrhages within a plaque may also cause symptoms. In practice, however, plaque ulcerations and intraplaque hemorrhages are difficult to define. The clinical presentation often offers valuable clues to the etiologic significance of nonstenotic carotid bifurcation plaques.
