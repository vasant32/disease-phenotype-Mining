We reported five cases of cerebral and/or cerebellar embolism after insertion of a heparin-coated catheter from the left thoracoacromial artery for multiple liver metastases. They were one patient with multiple liver metastases from the angiosarcoma of the scalp, and 4 others with gastrointestinal cancer liver metastases. The first case suffered a cerebeller embolism just after removal of a catheter that had been obstructed. In this case, it is possible that the thrombus quickly migrated into a cranial vessel from around the catheter. In the others with patent catheters, the cerebral embolisms occurred more than a month after insertion of the catheters. In the latter cases, it is thought that embolisms did not occur because of catheter insertion maneuver. However, a thrombus that grew around the catheter migrated into the left common carotid artery or the left vertebral artery. The anti-coagulation therapy should be considered for prophylactic treatment.
