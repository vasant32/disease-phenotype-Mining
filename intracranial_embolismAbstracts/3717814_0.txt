Thirty patients with acute severe lower limb arterial obstruction were treated with local administration of low dose Urokinase associated with Lysyl Plasminogen. Fifty-three per cent primary and 40 p. 100 secondary successes were obtained with few complications but one death due to cerebral embolism related to the catheterisation procedure. This intra-arterial therapeutic association seems to be as effective as local streptokinase infusion, but it is much better tolerated than other forms of treatment. It could be the treatment of choice in acute occlusive arterial disease of the lower limbs providing the therapeutic indications are strictly respected.
