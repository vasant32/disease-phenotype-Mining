Purpose of this study was to define a subgroup of TIA/stroke patients who should be examined by transthoracal and transesophageal echocardiography or Holter-electrocardiography to identify those with cardiogenic brain embolism reliably; 300 consecutive patients with acute focal brain ischemia underwent a standardized diagnostic protocol for the evaluation of the etiology including, clinical examination by a cardiologist and routine electrocardiography, Holter-electrocardiography, transthoracal and transesophageal echocardiography. 188 patients had a potential cardiac source of embolism. In particular echocardiography was diagnostic in 163 patients, and Holter-electrocardiography 10; 159 of these 188 patients (84.6%) had competitive etiologies, predominantly large vessel atherosclerosis. In 136 patients cardiogenic brain embolism was assumed as quite definite or possible. To identify these patients reliably, transthoracal and transesophageal echocardiography would have been necessary in 89% of the entire group of patients (all with clinically cardiological abnormalities, pathological routine ECG, without vascular risk factors, or no atherosclerosis in duplex sonography), and Holter-electrocardiography in 54%.
