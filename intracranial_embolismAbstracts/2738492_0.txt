A hospital-based study of the relationship between the hematocrit and thrombotic stroke was carried out among 117 patients admitted to Ramathibodi hospital. There was no significant difference in the age of patients with and without CT scan. Six patients, three males and one female with CT scan and one male and one female who did not have CT scan were found to have polycythemia vera. Ten patients had relative polycythemia (five had CT scan and five without CT scan). The mean age of patients with PV and relative polycythemia was not significantly different from those without polycythemia. The mean Hct in those with PV and relative polycythemia was generally higher than those without polycythemia. We recommended that Hct should be determined in every thrombotic stroke and a high Hct should be further studied for evidence of polycythemia vera or relative polycythemia.
