A U.S. Marine Corps Reconnaissance diver suffered arterial gas embolism (AGE) while using a closed-circuit oxygen rebreathing scuba apparatus; there are few, if any, reported occurrences of AGE due to gases other than air. The high oxygen fraction of the diver's inspired gas may have contributed to his rapid recovery once recompression therapy was initiated.
