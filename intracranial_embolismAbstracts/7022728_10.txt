Two cases of mycotic emboli of the peripheral vessels are presented, and 42 additional cases from the literature are analyzed. Male patients predominate 3:1. Candida and Aspergillus are the usual pathogens. Initial presentation as large vessel peripheral emboli is characteristic (77%), with emboli originating from either the aortic or mitral valves. Cerebral emboli may proceed of follow the peripheral embolization. Predisposing factors include open-heart surgery, antibiotic therapy, concomitant infection, and intravenous drug abuse. Early symptoms of fungemia are nonspecific, with blood cultures positive in only 43% of cases. The overall mortality rate was 84%-73% in patients who did not undergo previous open-heart surgery, and 96% in patients who underwent previous open-heart surgery. Patients with Candida infection seem to do better than those with Aspergillus endocarditis (19% survival versus 5%). Aggressive therapy, including embolectomy, early valve replacement, and prolonged antifungal drug therapy, is advised.
