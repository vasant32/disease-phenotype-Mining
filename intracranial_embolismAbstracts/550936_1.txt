2 cases of left atrial myxoma are presented, with a review of the recent literature on the topic, in order to bring this rare condition to the attention of clinicians. Both cases presented to the Neurological Unit of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital during 1978. The cases helped to emphasise the role of echocardiography in the routine appraisal of the stroke patient, especially if there are multiple lesions or if the patient concerned is young. The second case raised interseting questions regarding electrocardiographic changes associated with altered states of consiousness. Until recently cardiac myxomas were usually a postmortem diagnosis, but now with the effective combination of echocardiography and cine-angiography, cases are being effectively diagnosed and treated. It is hoped that with an increased awareness of the condition, diagnosis will be made sooner and thus prevent more severe sequelae occuring.
