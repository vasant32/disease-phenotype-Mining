BACKGROUND: Aneurysms involving the cervical portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) frequently result from prior trauma or dissection. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two patients are reported with cervical internal carotid artery aneurysms. In both cases, disease involving the contralateral ICA precluded safe treatment of the aneurysms by ICA occlusion. Endovascular stents placed across the diseased portion of the artery resulted in thrombosis of the aneurysm with preservation of the parent artery. CONCLUSION: Endovascular stent placement should be considered for treatment of aneurysms involving the cervical ICA when preservation of the parent vessel is necessary.
