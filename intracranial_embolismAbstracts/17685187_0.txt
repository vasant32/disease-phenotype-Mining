Approximately 25% of cerebral infarction is cardioembolic in nature. Transoesophageal echocardiography is widely regarded as the initial study of choice for evaluating cardiac source of embolism. We studied the records of 83 consecutive patients referred to our Neurologic Ward between January 2000 and October 2006 with diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular disease of unknown cause (cryptogenetic strokes). A potential cardiac of emboli source was found in 36.1% of the patients. Atrial septal abnormalities and aortic plaques accounted for most of the detected findings. Our experience suggests that routine transoesophageal echocardiography in this setting is of value and has a high impact on clinical management.
