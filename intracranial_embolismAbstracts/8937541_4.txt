INTRODUCTION: Focal neurologic deficits in sepsis frequently result from parenchymal lesions due to cerebral embolism. The aim of this study was to characterize clinical, laboratory and radiologic patterns of those patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 30 patients with focal neurologic symptoms during sepsis were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 24 patients (22 with infective endocarditis) had ischemic stroke. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses revealed inflammation in 11 of 12 patients. Patients who died (11/24) suffered more frequently from secondary intracerebral hemorrhage (p = 0.0031), which was significantly associated with intravenous high-dose anticoagulation (p = 0.0059). Six patients had slowly progressive focal neurologic deficits without evidence for stroke. All showed CSF inflammation and three developed multiple cerebral abscesses. CONCLUSIONS: There are two distinctive groups of patients with focal neurologic deficits during sepsis. One presents with stroke and CNS inflammation (septic embolic focal encephalitis). The other group develops slowly progressive focal neurologic deficits and sometimes multiple cerebral abscesses (septic metastatic focal encephalitis).
