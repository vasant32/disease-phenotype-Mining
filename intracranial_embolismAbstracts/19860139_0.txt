Formation of bubbles in tissue and vasculature from a sudden reduction in ambient pressure is likely an underlying cause of the clinical symptoms of decompression sickness (DCS). Thus, tools detecting bubbles in the vasculature may be important for evaluating DCS. Sheep were air-compressed to 6.0 ATA (30 minutes bottom time) then rapidly decompressed to the surface. A fundus camera was quickly positioned for continuous observation of the retinal vasculature. Bubbles were observed in the retinal vasculature of 25.8% (n = 31) of the sheep. Bubble onset time ranged from 5-22 minutes post-chamber and lodge time ranged from 0-70+ minutes. Bubbles were visualized mostly in the arteries of the retinal circulation. Severe vasoconstriction was captured using red-free angiography in two sheep. In two other sheep, fluorescein angiography demonstrated occluded blood flow caused by arterial gas emboli. This study demonstrates that retinal angiography is a practical tool for real-time, noninvasive detection of bubbles in the retinal circulation, a visible window to the cerebral circulation. Thus retinal angiography may prove invaluable in the early detection of arterial gas emboli in the cerebral circulation, the resolution of which is imperative to favorable neurological outcomes. This study also presents for the first time images of bubbles in the retinal circulation associated with DCS captured by a fundus camera.
