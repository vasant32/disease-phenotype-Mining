Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective modality for the treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma. It is used to treat small tumors and to downstage large tumors to meet liver transplant criteria. TACE can be associated with multiple side effects, including fever, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, cholecystitis and pancreatitis. Neurological complications after TACE are rare, usually caused by cerebral embolism, and confirmed by means of imaging studies. Spinal cord ischemia secondary to TACE is extremely rare and can lead to significant morbidity. We report a case of paraparesis caused by TACE with normal imaging and nerve conduction studies, suggestive of localized vasculitis.
