Embolic phenomena, early after endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery, were observed in 8 of 28 cases. No patient suffered from ischemic events. 24 h later, no further embolic signals could be detected. These and other observations of an increased risk of perioperative thrombosis and cerebral infarction, in the case of persistent embolic signals during the early recovery period, confirm the probably important role of the transcranial emboli detection in the monitoring of carotid surgery.
