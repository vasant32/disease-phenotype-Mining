The intention of minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) is to reduce priming volume and minimize contact of blood with polymers and air in a closed system. In contrast to conventional extracorporeal circulation (ECC), a venous reservoir is missing. Thus, air trapping is limited and avoidance of bubble embolism is a major concern. This study investigates microbubbles (MBB) number and size in the venous and arterial lines of ECC and MECC compared to the number of microembolic signals (MES) in the right and left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Twenty patients undergoing coronary surgery were operated either with conventional ECC (cardiotomy reservoir, Rotaflow pump, Quadrox oxygenator, Quart filter) or MECC (Quart filter, Rotaflow pump, Quadrox oxygenator). Number and size of MBB were monitored in the venous and arterial lines with an ultrasound Doppler system. MES in right and left MCAs were measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring. Patients undergoing MECC had additional sealing of the venous cannula by a ligature at the site of its insertion into the right atrium. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to age, X-clamping, bypass time and number of distal anastomoses. The number of MES and MBB in the arterial line was comparable between the groups. On the venous side, MECC-perfusion shows a significantly lower number of MBB. This could be explained with the additional sealing of the venous cannula. Furthermore, our data indicate that the MBB-volume reaching the pump will also appear in the arterial outflow and into the patient's MCA. For this reason, the avoidance of air contamination is a major concern for surgeons, anaesthesiologists and perfusionists.
