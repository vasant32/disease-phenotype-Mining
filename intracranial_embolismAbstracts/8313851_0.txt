A 37-year-old woman with increasing dyspnoea over several months suddenly developed severe ortho- and tachypnoea as well as cyanosis of the lips and acrocyanosis. Pulmonary angiography revealed massive bilateral pulmonary emboli with a systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 75 mm Hg. Phlebography demonstrated a thrombotic occlusion of the deep veins of the left leg extending to the distal femoral vein. Thrombolysis treatment was started via an indwelling pulmonary artery catheter (500,000 IU urokinase and 10,000 IU heparin as bolus, then 1 mill. IU urokinase and 1,000 IU heparin per hour). After two hours an incomplete left-sided paresis occurred (involving ocular and facial muscles, dysarthria, left arm and left leg) and the thrombolytic infusion was stopped. But cerebral computed tomography (CT) did not demonstrate any intracerebral haemorrhage. The heparin infusion was restarted (partial thromboplastin time between 70 and 90 s). CT examinations during the next few days showed the development of an ischaemic infarction in the distribution of the right medial cerebral artery. Angiography demonstrated occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. The diagnosis of a paradoxical embolus was supported by easy cardiac catheter passage through a patent foramen ovale. Subsequent pulmonary angiography demonstrated a thrombus-free pulmonary arterial circulation with a normal pulmonary arterial pressure. There was gradual and extensive regression of the incomplete hemiparesis.
