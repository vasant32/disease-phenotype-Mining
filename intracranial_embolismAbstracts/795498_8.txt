Intramuscular dexamethasone combined with intravenous low-molecular-weight dextran (dextran 40) was compared with placebo in 40 patients with acute ischaemic cerebral infarction. A double-blind procedure was used. Dexamethasone was given for up to 14 days and dextran 40 for up to three days after the infarction. A weighted scoring system was used to evaluate neurological state and mobility. There were no differences in mortality or in improvement of the neurological or mobility scores between the two groups.
