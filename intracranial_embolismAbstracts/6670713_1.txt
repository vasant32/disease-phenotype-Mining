A 9-year-old boy developed ataxia, right transient hemiparesis, left transient hemichorea, dysarthria and swallowing difficulties with left velar paralysis following two transient episodes of vomiting, headache and dizziness. Angiography demonstrated an occlusion of the distal part of the basilar artery. Thirty-six previously reported cases of vertebro-basilar arterial occlusion in children were reviewed, with particular regard to possible etiologies.
