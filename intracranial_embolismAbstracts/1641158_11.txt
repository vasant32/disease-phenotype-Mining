We evaluated 183 patients with brain ischemia for an embolic source, using transesophageal echocardiography with extensive imaging of the thoracic aorta. There were mobile, frond-like projections of aortic plaque in seven (4%) patients. The plaque originated on a wide base on the posterior aspect of the ascending aorta at its junction with the transverse arch in six patients, and on the aortic root in one. The acute event was a cerebral infarction in five patients, and a transient ischemic attack in two. This type of aortic plaque could be a previously underdiagnosed source of cerebral embolism that is now easily visualized by transesophageal echocardiography.
