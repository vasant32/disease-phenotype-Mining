Local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) is an effective treatment for selected patients in acute thromboembolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, vertebrobasilar system or ophthalmic artery. However, the risk/benefit ratio of thrombolysis in patient subgroups requires classification. Advanced age has been regarded as a prognostic factor for poor clinical outcome. We report our experience with LIF in seven patients with a mean age of 79 years (range 76-83 years) who represented thromboembolic occlusion of the basilar, middle cerebral or pericallosal arteries. We discuss why advanced age need not contraindicate LIF.
