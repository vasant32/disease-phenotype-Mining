Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is now widely used in the evaluation of patients with unexplained stroke or transient ischemic attack, in part to exclude the presence of protruding aortic arch atheromas. We report two cases in which repeated TEE revealed an aortic clot not seen on the earlier transesophageal echocardiogram performed immediately after embolization. These cases illustrate the dynamic nature of aortic thrombus and the role of TEE in its diagnosis.
