Dynamic cardiomyoplasty is a technique for ventricular assistance indicated for the correction of left ventricle aneurysm and for cardiomyopathies in which heart transplantation is contraindicated. In this article, our first four patients to undergo cardiomyoplasty (from February 1991 until April 1992) with a left latissimus dorsi island flap, rotated into the thorax after a 3-week training period, are reviewed. Therapeutic indications were cardiomyopathy with contraindication for heart transplant in patients 1 and 4 and associated to surgery for left ventricle aneurysm for patients 2 and 3. Patient 1 died 4 months after surgery because of a cerebral embolism when he was at functional class II. The other three patients remain at functional class I, carrying out normal activities. All the data were evaluated with the paired t test. Ejection fraction values (obtained through echocardiography and scintigraphy studies) and maximum minute flow rate of blood (measured with an echo-Doppler) have increased significantly (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively) after heart surgery. Clinical improvement has been found after cardiomyoplasty, which correlates with an increase in ejection fraction and maximum minute flow rate of blood.
