Summary: We report 3 cases of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis with thrombus. The initial symptom is transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 1 case, and cerebral infarction due to artery-to-artery embolism in 2 cases.We started anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy after the angiography on admission in all cases. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was performed in 1 case after confirming the disappearance of the thrombus 1 month after the initial attack, although small cerebral embolic infarction happened during this period. In the other cases, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting was performed using the protective technique about 2 weeks after the initial attack without embolic complication. Postoperative angiography showed sufficient dilatation. It seemed that PTA/stenting using the protection system was one of the alternatives for ICA stenosis with thrombus.
