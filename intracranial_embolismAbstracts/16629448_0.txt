A 45-year-old woman, who had had rheumatoid arthritis for 12 years, had three attacks of cerebral embolism over two months and died after the final attack. Intensive clinical laboratory investigations did not disclose any specific origins of emboli, but an autopsy revealed a nodule at the base of the aortic valve which was pathologically proved to be a rheumatoid nodule. The thrombi were present from the distal part of left internal carotid artery up to the proximal part of the left middle cerebral artery. They were rich in fiber, but poorly organized endothelial cell, raising the possibility that they originated from other parts and have recently reached there. On the top of the rheumatoid nodule, a thrombus was present. It was easily ablated and a small amount of fibrin stuck the nodule. Based on these results, we concluded that cerebral emboli were originally generated at the top of a rheumatoid nodule in the heart. In patients with RA, rheumatoid nodules are rarely seen in the heart. If present, they usually cause cardiac failure or atrioventricular block, and seldom result in cerebral infarction. This is the first case in which an autopsy proved rheumatoid nodule in the heart which had caused multiple cerebral emboli. We should consider the possibility of rheumatoid nodules in the heart as an origin of cerebral emboli in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
