One calf, which weighed 87 kilograms, survived for 25 days with a total artificial heart (TAH) implanted orthotopically. All hemodynamic parameters stayed normal except the right atrial pressure (RAP), which increased gradually toward the end of the experiment. The cardiac output was maintained between 8.0 and 11.0 L. per minute. Kidney function was well maintained, and no pulmonary insufficiency was noted. Infection became obvious after 2 weeks of pumping although it was controlled to the extent that the calf was able to eat, to several factors, amont them mechanical damage to red blood cells, infection, malnutrition, and liver damage. The calf was standing until 30 minutes before its sudden death from cerebral thromboembolism. The calf's activity throughout the postoperative course convinced us of the feasibility of clinical application and of immediate application to studies of cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology.
