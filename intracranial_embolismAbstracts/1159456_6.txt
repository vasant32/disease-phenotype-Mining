The relationship between the rCBF and the electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency was investigated in the contralateral hemisphere of 22 patients with acute cerebral infarction. Reduced rCBF was observed in all patients studied. The degree of rCBF reduction was mild, moderate, or severe and ranged between 6 and 80% from the lowest age-matched normal values obtained in our laboratory. The frequency indices remained within normal limits (mean - 10.4 Hz) in 16 patients. Slower frequencies (mean - 6.3 Hz) were recorded in 6 patients. No correlation was found between the two parameters (P = 0.89). Both the EEG frequency and the rCBF are known to be closely related to the cerebral metabolic rate. The observed rCBF depression without concomitant changes in the EEG frequency raises the question of the role of globally-reduced cerebral metabolism as the cause of rCBF reduction in the noninfarcted hemisphere in stroke patients. Our findings constitute additional evidence that the contralateral hemisphere is involved in the haemodynamic changes occurring in acute cerebral infarction.
