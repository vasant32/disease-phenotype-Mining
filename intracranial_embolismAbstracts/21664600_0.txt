This observation relates to the discovery of native coronary paradoxical embolism secondary to thrombus adherent to the right atrium through a patent foramen ovale (PFO). A patient of 64 years, with a history of mitral regurgitation not followed, was hospitalized for acute respiratory distress due to a mitral insufficiency (MI) with a ruptured chordae and pulmonary embolism. Coronary angiography was performed and revealed two typical images of coronary embolism associated to a non-atheromatous coronary tree. The patient underwent a mitral valve replacement. After the establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass, adherent fibrin and cruoric thrombus of the right atrium and a PFO were found. The analysis of the valves did not reveal any arguments for infective endocarditis. A CT scan, performed as the patient remained unconscious after surgery, showed several cerebral infarcts. Paradoxical embolism coronary was diagnosed in front of the combination of adherent thrombus in the right atrium, pulmonary embolism and systemic coronary and cerebral embolism with a PFO. Coronary embolism rarely happens. It is mainly due to three causes: iatrogenic origin in most cases, direct causes due to micro emboli, particularly from infectious endocarditis and paradoxical embolic origin. There are two types of right atrial thrombus; the most common is the mobile thrombus from the peripheral venous system. The other one, which is more rare, is the adherent thrombus, which occurs in situ. Coronary embolism of paradoxical origin represents a small proportion of the causes of coronary embolism. However, this diagnosis must be considered.
