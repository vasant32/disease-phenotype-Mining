A retrospective survey was made of neurologic complications of cardiac catheterization. Of 10 patients, only one had a diffuse disorder, with seizures of a type associated with reaction to contrast agents. Disorders in the other nine patients appeared to be embolic in nature. Five of these nine involved deficits indicating damage in the vertebrobasilar territories, suggesting local trauma to vessels as a source of the embolic material.
