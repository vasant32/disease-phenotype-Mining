A case of intracavernous aneurysm secondary to septic cavernous sinus thrombosis demonstrating sequential dynamic angiographic changes is reported. Serial angiograms of a 32-year-old man with septic cavernous sinus infection revealed a normal study, stenosis, recovery of stenosis, and aneurysmal formation. Superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and internal carotid artery ligation were performed because of progressive ophthalmoplegia. Neurological deficit rapidly disappeared. Anigiographic changes and surgical treatment of septic cavernous sinus thrombosis are discussed.
