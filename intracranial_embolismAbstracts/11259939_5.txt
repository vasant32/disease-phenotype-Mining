A 42-year-old woman with subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage was investigated with diagnostic angiography, disclosing an occlusion of the left internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery. CT examination immediately after the angiography revealed a 12-h-old infarct of the left middle cerebral artery territory. There was also gas in the arteries supplying the infarcted part of the brain, but not in other vessels. Air had most probably been introduced during the angiography and had consequently been "trapped" in the cortical arteries of the ischemic brain. In the non-ischemic parts of the brain air may have passed through the vessels leaving no trace.
