We experienced a case of familial cardiac myxoma observed in a mother and her daughter. A 58-year-old woman was addmited to our hospital because of repeated cerebral embolism. Echocardiography showed a left atrial myxoma to be considered as the cause of cerebral embolism. At the operation, 3 myxomas were found in the left atrium, and were removed successfully. No recurrence has been observed for 14 years after the operation. Three years after that, her 3rd child, 31-year-old-women, suffered from cerebral embolism and was also diagnosed as a left atrial myxoma. A friable myxoma was removed with the interatrial septum. She had no recurrence for 11 years after the operation. In patients with cardiac myxoma who have unusual biologic behavior, including familial myxoma, "complex" type myxoma must be suspected. We suggest that it is important to distinguish patients with "complex" type myxoma, because the recurrence rate is much higher in those than in patients with "sporadic" type myxoma.
