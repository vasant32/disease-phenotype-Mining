Two cases of fatal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cerebral involvement are described. Both showed widespread microinfarction of the brain secondary to platelet and fibrin thrombi. There was no evidence of vasculitis. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs may have an important role in the management of cerebral SLE.
