We report clinical, neuroimaging and immunological findings in seven women with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) and cerebral ischemia. Two patients had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and five had the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Autopsies were done in 3 women who died acutely with focal neurological deficits. Evidence for cerebral embolism was found in all patients: a) pathology demonstrated multiple cerebral infarctions and cerebral emboli from underlying non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) in the patients who died. b) Three patients had thickened mitral valves and embolic cerebral occlusions were identified with cerebral angiography. c) In one patient, echocardiography detected a thrombus on the posterior leaflet of a prolapsing mitral valve at the time of ictus. Our data provide further evidence to implicate valvular endothelium in the genesis of cerebral ischemia in some patients with APLA.
