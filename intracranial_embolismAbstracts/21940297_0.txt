Acute cerebral embolism or cerebral aneurysm formation as a consequence of left atrial myxomas has been well documented, but the formation of multiple cerebral aneurysms resulting from atrial myxoma is a very rare neurological complication. We present the case of a 72-year-old-woman with a cardiac myxoma who suffered multiple cerebral mycotic aneurysms. After experiencing both vertigo and a sudden collapse accompanied by loss of consciousness, she underwent cerebral computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, which revealed multiple cerebral mycotic aneurysms of various dimensions and a large cyst, as a result of a previous haemorrhage. Embolisation was performed in large aneurysms of the circle of Willis but not in the one located in the periphery, and re-examination for a cardiac intervention a month later was indicated. The risk of cerebral haemorrhage was considered high; thus she was not operated on. Conservative treatment followed. Two years after the first diagnosis the patient remains healthy, suggesting that in such cases we should also consider conservative treatment. According to the literature, the risk is high when aneurysms are large, multiple and intractable. We propose that cerebral CT or MRI scan should be performed before operation in all patients with a cardiac myxoma, especially in those with left cardiac chamber localisation.
