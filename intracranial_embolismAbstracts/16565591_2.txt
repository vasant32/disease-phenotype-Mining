Systemic embolization is a potential complication in patients with thrombi situated in the left atrium and particularly, in the left atrial appendage (LAA). Reduced LAA contraction velocities, determined by the transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), are associated with increased risk of LAA spontaneous echocontrast and thrombus formation, and a history of systemic embolism. However, TEE remains a semi-invasive procedure, limiting its serial application as a screening tool. Therefore, it is desirable to obtain information regarding LAA function by transthoracic echocardiography in patients having cardioembolic stroke. The present study was designed to investigate various echocardiographic variables for patients with stroke to predict LAA dysfunction, reflected as reduced LAA contraction velocity. We studied a total of 61 patients with newly diagnosed acute embolic stroke (42 patients) and transient ischemic attack (19 patients). Computerized tomographic scanning was performed for the diagnosis of embolic stroke. Left atrial functional parameters determined by transthoracic echocardiography, such as left atrial active emptying fraction and acceleration slope of mitral inflow A wave, had significant correlations with the LAA contraction velocity (r = 0.57, p < 0.001; r = 0.54, p < 0.001, respectively). Left atrial volume index, left atrial active emptying volume and left atrial fractional shortening were also correlated with LAA contraction velocity (r = -0.44, p < 0.001; r = 0.38, p = 0.003; r = 0.37, p = 0.004, respectively). In conclusion, transthoracic echocardiography can provide valuable and reliable information about the LAA contraction velocity in stroke patients with sinus rhythm. This finding gives new insights for the appropriate strategy in the evaluation of an acute ischemic stroke.
