BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dopamine plays an important role in striatal function. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the pathophysiological changes in striatal dopamine metabolism after microsphere embolism. METHODS: Microspheres (48 microns) were injected into the right internal carotid artery of rats. Extracellular levels of dopamine and its metabolites were measured by in vivo microdialysis with the aid of high-performance liquid chromatography. In vivo striatal tyrosine hydroxylation and turnover (catabolism) rate of dopamine were estimated on the first and third days after the embolism. These were estimated by measuring tissue dopa or dopamine content in the presence of either an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor or a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, respectively. RESULTS: In the microdialysis study, a 190-fold increase in the release of dopamine from the right striatum was observed 40 minutes after microsphere embolism, whereas the striatal dopamine metabolites decreased during the first 180 minutes after the embolism. Microsphere embolism decreased the striatal dopamine content throughout the experiment (28 days), whereas it increased tissue dopamine metabolites on the first day, followed by a decline in the metabolites on the third day or later. The in vivo turnover rate of dopamine decreased both on the first and third days, whereas the in vivo tyrosine hydroxylation decreased only on the third day after the embolism. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that microsphere embolism induces severe damage to striatal dopaminergic metabolism 3 to 28 days after the embolism. Dopamine synthesis may be more resistant to the embolism-induced ischemic insults than its catabolism.
