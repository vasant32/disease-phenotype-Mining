An 18-year-old woman taking an oral contraceptive was admitted to hospital because of a stroke due to occlusion of three branches of the right middle cerebral artery. She later developed renovascular hypertension due to occlusion of one of two renal arteries on the right side. Occlusion of the ceoliac artery was also found. The circumstances suggest that the occlusions were caused by multiple emboli, the source of which could not be identified. The kidney with the circulatory disturbance was shown to have a persistent abnormal renin secretion three and six months after the stroke, but the peripheral renin level was lower at the second investigation. Cardiac function studies revealed an alarming degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, and satisfactory blood pressure control could not be maintained despite increasing antihypertensive therapy. Surgical corrrction of the circulatory disturbance promptly led to normotension without drugs, and the patient has remained normotensive during the postoperative observation period of twelve months. The oral contraceptive was probably responsible for precipitating the vascular occlusions, but no predisposing factors or warning symptoms were present to identify this patient as being at risk.
