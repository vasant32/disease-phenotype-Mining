In a review of 768 consecutive autopsies, 21 (2.7%) clinically unsuspected cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome were diagnosed by histologic examination. DIC was diagnosed by the presence of fibrin thrombi in arterioles, capillaries, venules, and medium-sized veins. Fibrin thrombi were found, in the descending order of frequency, in the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, adrenals, spleen and liver. Most patients had multiple visceral involvement, with three showing fibrin thrombi in as many as ten organs. The density of fibrin thrombi was greatest in the spleen, followed by kidneys, liver, lungs, adrenals, brain, and heart. A review of clinical data showed that infections were the most common underlying conditions in 13 cases, including nine with positive bacterial cultures from blood or cerebrospinal fluid, or both. The results suggest that, despite increasing clinical recognition of DIC, a great number of patients remain unsuspected of having the DIC syndrome prior to postmortem examination.
