Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was carried out in eight patients with cervical arterial stenosis; six in the subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries (5 with subclavian steal syndrome), one in the common carotid artery, and one in both the brachiocephalic and common carotid arteries (with subclavian steal syndrome). The PTA balloon catheters were introduced via the femoral artery in seven and brachial artery in one. To prevent distal embolization through the vertebral and internal carotid arteries, the blood flow in these vessels was temporarily occluded with a balloon catheter. The dilation of the stenotic areas was generally satisfactory. Antegrade blood flow was promptly obtained in the vertebral artery even in patients with subclavian steal syndrome. In all patients, the clinical symptoms improved. Two patients underwent repeat PTA because of restenosis.
