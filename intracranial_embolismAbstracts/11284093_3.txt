Two cases of vascular tumors of large vessels with intraluminal growth simulating venous thrombosis and arterial occlusive disease are reported. One was a borderline malignant epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the femoral vein and the other a malignant epithelioid angiosarcoma of the carotid artery. Immunohistochemical studies permitted to classify the tumors. Treatment consisted in surgical resection. No recurrence and no metastasis are noted at 24 months. Uncertainty regarding biological behaviour of vascular tumors and treatment persists.
