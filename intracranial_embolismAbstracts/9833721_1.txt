OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the occurrence, intensity and rate of high-intensity transient signals (HITS), measured in both middle cerebral arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) after mechanical or homograft aortic valve implantation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TCD monitoring was performed by means of a pulsed Doppler ultrasound with two 2 MHz probes, stabilized on the head and directed at the middle cerebral artery. SETTING: Outdoor patients after aortic valve replacement in a university hospital. PATIENTS: The study cohort comprised a random transverse sample of patients and included 20 patients with a mechanical aortic valve and 20 with a homograft aortic valve. Comparisons were made with 20 admitted control patients. INTERVENTIONS: No interventions. MEASURES: No significant number of HITS were expected in the homograft group and a limited number in the mechanical valve group. RESULTS: HITS were detected in more patients after implantation of a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis compared with a homograft aortic valve (16 versus 8, p=0.02). Nevertheless, more patients with a homograft aortic valve showed HITS than the control patients (8 versus 1, p=0.02). The mean number of HITS in the mechanical prosthesis group was higher than in the homograft group (3, range 0-18 versus 13, range 0-70, p<0.05). HITS in patients with mechanical prostheses had a higher amplitude than HITS in patients with homograft aortic valves (p<0.0001). Focal neurological deficit (FND) was diagnosed in 9 patients (mechanical prosthesis 6 versus homograft 3, ns). CONCLUSIONS: HITS commonly occur both in patients with a mechanical aortic valve and in patients with a homograft aortic valve. HITS occur significantly less often, at a lower rate and with a lower intensity in patients with homograft aortic valve compared with patients with a mechanical aortic valve. Future studies should elucidate the nature and prognostic significance of HITS and their relationship with thromboembolic events.
