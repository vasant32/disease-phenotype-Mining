BACKGROUND: The isoprenoid pathway was assessed and compared in patients of lone atrial fibrillation with embolic stroke as well as in patients with right hemispheric, left hemispheric and bihemispheric dominance to determine the role of hemispheric dominance in its pathogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The activities of hydroxyl methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase and RBC sodium-potasium ATPase as well as serum levels of plasma magnesium, digoxin, dolichol and ubiquinone were measured. The tyrosine/tryptophan catabolic patterns, glycoconjugate metabolism, free radical metabolism and RBC membrane composition were also assessed. In patients with lone atrial fibrillation with embolic stroke, there was elevated digoxin synthesis, increased dolichol and glycoconjugate levels, and low ubiquinone and elevated free radical levels. There was also an increase in tryptophan catabolites and a reduction in tyrosine catabolites: and an increase in the cholesterol: phospholipid ratio with a reduction in the glycoconjugate levels of the RBC membrane. The same biochemical patterns were obtained in individuals with right hemispheric dominance whereas the patterns were reversed in patients with left hemispheric dominance. CONCLUSIONS: Lone atrial fibrillation with embolic stroke is associated with an upregulated isoprenoid pathway and elevated digoxin secretion from the hypothalamus. This occurs in right hemisphere-dominant individuals.
