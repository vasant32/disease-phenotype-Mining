An unusual case of traumatic aneurysm of the A-1 part of the anterior cerebral artery associated with a contralateral carotid-cavernous fistula is presented. Trapping of the fistula was carried out, and an attempt to repair the vessel wall was made. Thrombosis of the vessel occurred, but remained asymptomatic. Causes, physiopathology, and treatment of traumatic aneurysms are discussed.
