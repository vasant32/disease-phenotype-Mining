PURPOSE: This investigation was conducted to determine whether MR imaging showed cerebral or spinal damage in acute diving-related decompression illness, a term that includes decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism (AGE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 16 divers with dysbaric injuries were examined after the initiation of therapeutic recompression. Their injuries comprised: neurological DCS II n = 8; AGE n = 7; combined cerebral-AGE/spinal-DCS n = 1. T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained in 2 planes. In addition, the spinal cord was imaged in 7 subjects. The imaging findings were correlated with the neurological symptoms. RESULTS: MR images of the head showed ischemic cerebrovascular lesions in 6/8 patients with AGE but showed focal hyperintensities in only 2/8 divers with DCS. Spinal cord involvement was detected in 1/7 examinations, which was the combined cerebral-AGE/spinal-DCS case. There was agreement between the locations of the documented lesions and the clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: MR readily detects cerebral damage in AGE but yields low sensitivity in DCS. A negative MR investigation cannot rule out AGE or DCS. However, MR is useful in the examination of patients with decompression illness.
