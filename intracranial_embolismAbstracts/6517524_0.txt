Much has been written about the changing clinical spectrum of infective endocarditis. However our survey shows that the classical text book descriptions still hold good. The majority of our patients were young with 79% either 30 years or below. Fever was present in 93%, splenomegaly in 50% and cerebral embolism in 43% of our patients. Twelve patients had valvular heart disease and 2 patients had a ventricular septal defect. Eleven out of 14 patients had a positive blood culture. Echocardiography detected definite or probable vegetations in 66% of the examinations. Five patients responded satisfactorily to antibiotic therapy, 2 patients discharged themselves from hospital against medical advice, and 4 patients underwent successful cardiac surgery. Three patients died during medical therapy.
