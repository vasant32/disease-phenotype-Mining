Although left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus formation in the presence of sinus rhythm may potentially be the source for embolic events in various types of heart disease, no cases of LAA thrombus with embolic stroke in association with aortic stenosis in sinus rhythm have been reported. We present a case of valvular aortic stenosis with cerebral embolism in a person who was in sinus rhythm and had an LAA thrombus diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography.
