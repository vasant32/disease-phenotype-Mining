We investigated the effect of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on the thrombolytic efficacy of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), platelet aggregability, serum cholesterol and phospholipids. Male Wistar rats (6 weeks old) received dietary DHA supplementation (300 mg/kg per day) for 8 weeks. The rat middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by a thrombus induced by photochemical reaction between rose bengal and green light which cause endothelial damage followed by platelet adhesion, aggregation and formation of a platelet and fibrin-rich thrombus at the site of photochemical reaction. The MCA blood flow was monitored using a laser Doppler flowmeter. rt-PA was administered 30 min after the middle cerebral artery had been occluded by a thrombus. This regimen produced a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in serum free-cholesterol and phospholipids levels, inhibited platelet aggregation ex-vivo induced by collagen in whole blood (P < 0.05), reduced thromboxane (TX) B2 formation (P < 0.01) in whole blood and prolonged the time for thrombotic MCA occlusion (P < 0.01) as compared with values obtained from animals on standard diet. Further, dietary DHA enhanced thrombolytic efficacy of rt-PA and reduced the size of ischaemic cerebral lesions. Our findings suggest that dietary DHA produces antithrombotic effects via metabolic conversion to non-atherogenic and non-platelet stimulant metabolites.
