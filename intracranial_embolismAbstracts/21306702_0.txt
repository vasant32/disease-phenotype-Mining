Cannabis is the most consumed drug in France, particularly in young adults. Few reports have suggested a causal role of cannabis in the development of cardiovascular events. We describe one case of 26-year-old man, cannabis and tobacco smoker, admitted with recurrent ischemic stroke cause by post-myocardial infarction left ventricular thrombus. Coronary arteries were angiographicaly normal and etiological tests were negative. We suggest the possible relationship between marijuana use with coronary heart disease.
