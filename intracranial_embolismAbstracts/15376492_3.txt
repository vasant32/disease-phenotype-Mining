The use of diffusion weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient mapping in the diagnosis of cerebral fat embolism is shown here to demonstrate infarcts secondary to fat emboli more intensely than T2 weighted sequences 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Embolic foci are hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient mapping consistent with cytotoxic edema associated with cell death and restricted water diffusion. This technique increases the sensitivity for detecting cerebral fat embolism and offers a potentially important tool in its diagnosis.
