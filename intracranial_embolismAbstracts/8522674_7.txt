Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality following multiple fractures. Neurological involvement (cerebral fat embolism) has been reported frequently. A case of cerebral fat embolism is reported. While CT scan revealed no abnormalities, MRI, performed in this patient 8 days after trauma, showed relative low-intensity areas on T1-weighted images and high intensity areas on T2-weighted images involving cerebral white matter, corpus callosum and basal ganglia. MRI follow-up (1 and 3 months post-trauma) showed nearly complete resolution of the abnormal signal. MRI seems to be a useful diagnostic tool for detecting and quantifying lesions in fat embolism syndrome.
