Penetration of Sodium Cephalothin (CET) into CSF follwing intravenous administration was studied in 23 patients with intracranial diseases excluding inflammation and severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. 1) After intravenous injection of 2 g of CET, ventricular CSF was obtained in 4 cases. All these 4 cases showed CET concentration in CSF to be below 0.1 mcg/ml. 2) After intravenous injection of 2 g of CET, lumbar CSF was obtained in 6 cases. In two cases out of these 6 cases, CET concentration in CSF was higher than 0.7 mcg/ml. 3) In 13 cases 2 g of CET with 200ml of 20% Mannitol was injected intravenously and lumbar CSF was examined. CET concentrations in CSF between 0.7 mcg/ml and 6.0 mcg/ml were observed in 9 cases of this group. 4) According to the results it is strongly suggested that the administration of Monnitol and CET is very effective for penetration of CET into CSF.
