The authors present a case of an aneurysm of the inferior vena cava in a 5-year-old boy. The boy suffered from acute pulmonary and paradoxical cerebral embolism after a minor abdominal trauma. Magnetic resonance angiography was the key for correct diagnosis of the retroperitoneal process and helped develop a strategy for surgery. The boy underwent resection of the aneurysm and a prosthetic replacement of the distal inferior vena cava. Aneurysms of the inferior vena cava are very rare conditions. The diagnosis is difficult because they may mimic a retroperitoneal tumor. Thrombosis and embolism are common complications of aneurysms of the vena cava.
