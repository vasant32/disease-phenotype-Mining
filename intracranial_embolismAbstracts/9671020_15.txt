In a prospective study of 312 older patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, at 36-month follow-up evaluation, new thromboembolic stroke developed in 162 of 312 patients (52%). Significant independent risk factors for new thromboembolic stroke were prior stroke (risk ratio = 1.6), rheumatic mitral stenosis (risk ratio = 2.0), left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (risk ratio = 2.8), abnormal LV ejection fraction (risk ratio = 1.8), serum total cholesterol (risk ratio = 1.005), and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (risk ratio = 0.96).
