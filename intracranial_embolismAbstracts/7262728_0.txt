A study was conducted on the electroencephalographical and neuropathological correlations on 96 cases of cerebrovascular disease in order to elucidate the reasons why EEGs are often misleading in the diagnosis of location and size cerebrovascular lesions. The study showed that EEG findings are particularly misleading when the lesions were in the locations as follows: 1) subcortical deep infarctions, 2) cortical infarctions occupying a small proportion of cerebral convexity, or involving an entire hemisphere, or affecting the right hemisphere, 3) basilar thrombosis and infratentorial hemorrhage (primary or secondary to supratentorial lesions). The pathophysiological significance of these results has been discussed.
