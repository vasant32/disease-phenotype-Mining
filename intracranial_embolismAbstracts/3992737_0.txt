A clinical study of the adverse effects induced by the endocrine therapy with a high dose of estrogen in 45 patients with stage C or D prostatic carcinoma is conducted. Transient decreases of hemoglobin and serum protein values were observed after administration of estrogen. The levels of glutamine-oxaloacetic and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase showed a transient increase. The value of serum total cholesterol and electrolytes showed no changes. Serial evaluations of electrocardiograms have played a minor role in the observation of cardiovascular disease. Up to date we have not experienced cardiovascular death in our cases during the endocrine therapy.
