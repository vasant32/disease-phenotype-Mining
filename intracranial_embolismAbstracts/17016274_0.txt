This review focuses on the effects of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass on the brain, with special emphasis on the results of recently conducted studies. The incidence of postoperative neurological and neuropsychological deficits and risk factors for cerebral injury are reviewed. The relationships between cerebral embolic load, release of biochemical markers of brain injury and cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery are also reviewed. Finally, recently gained information on the management of cardiopulmonary bypass is discussed, along with the results of recent pharmacological neuroprotective trials in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
