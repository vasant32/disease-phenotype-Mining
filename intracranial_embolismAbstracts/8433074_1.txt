To study left ventricular thrombus (LVT) formation and arterial embolism (AE), 106 consecutive patients with a first acute anterior myocardial infarction (AAMI) underwent two-dimensional echocardiography before discharge. Repeated assessments for detection of AE were performed. Patients were non-randomly allocated to either no heparin, low-dose heparin or high-dose heparin. LVT was found in 25 (26.9%) of 93 patients with technically satisfactory echocardiograms. Left ventricular (LV) wall motion impairment (P = 0.0017) and treatment with either heparin or low-dose heparin (P = 0.0019) were independent predictors of LVT formation. AE, all strokes, occurred in 10 patients (9.4%) and was strongly associated with high age (P = 0.0013). In conclusion, LVT and AE are frequent complications to AAMI. LV wall motion impairment predisposes for LVT and low-dose heparin seems not to prevent these complications.
