 BACKGROUND: Although the mechanism of migraine is regarded as a functional disorder of the brain, numerous studies have reported that migraine is closely associated with vascular system abnormalities. CASE REPORTS: We describe a 19-year-old female with recurrent migraine attacks and typical aura for 7 years. MRI showed multiple stroke lesions in the posterior circulation. Moreover, a pseudoaneurysm (1.9 Ã— 1.4 cm) originating from the left vertebral artery was observed on four-vessel angiography. Multiple microembolic signals (MES) were repeatedly observed in the basilar artery using 30-minute transcranial Doppler monitoring. Interestingly, MES and her typical migrainous symptoms disappeared simultaneously with removal of the pseudoaneurysm. DISCUSSION: This case supports the fact that microemboli play a pivotal role in the development of migraine attacks.
