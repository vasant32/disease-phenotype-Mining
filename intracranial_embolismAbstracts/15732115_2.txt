We report a case of cerebral fat embolism which occurred in a 33-year-old man after a diaphyseal femoral fracture without cranial traumatism. The initial examination showed an incomplete picture of coma with tetrapyramidal syndrome and cutaneomucous purpura. There was no respiratory damage. We present a magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of the cerebral lesions observed in the initial phase of the embolism, as well as follow-up, which has strengthened the clinical and imaging features for the diagnosis.
