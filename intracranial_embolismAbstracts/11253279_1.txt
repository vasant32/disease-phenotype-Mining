HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 58-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency room after reanimation in hypotensive shock, under sedation and respiration. INVESTIGATIONS: The cardiac laboratory markers were within normal limits. The ECG demonstrated a sinustachycardia with typical infarction signs. The echocardiogram showed a hypokinesia of the cardiac apex. DIAGNOSTICS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Acute myocardial infarction was treated with a systemic rt-PA lysis. The course was complicated by: confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, left ventricular thrombus and a cerebral embolism. After multiple adaptations of the anticoagulation regimen, the patient was discharged in a good condition without major neurologic deficits. CONCLUSION: With a careful anticoagulation regimen it is possible to achieve a successful outcome in major complications such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, left ventricular thrombus and cerebral embolism.
