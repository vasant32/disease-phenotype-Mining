16 specimens of cerebral embolism were studied with regard to their pathological and clinical manifestations. Close observations were made in 35 foci of infarction and 24 emboli in 14 specimens, among which 5 were multi-embolic. Most of the embolism were located at the bifurcations of the middle cerebral arteries. The emboli in 11 specimens were confirmed to be cardiogenic and in 1 specimen to be neoplastic. 7 specimens and twelve emboli were examined under the scanning electron microscope. It was found that the pathological appearances of the emboli varied and there were tiny spaces inside the embolized arteries. This might facilitate the embolus to get organized.
