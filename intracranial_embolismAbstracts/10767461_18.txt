OBJECTIVE: Oral antibiotic use may have changed the incidence and microbiology of otitic intracranial complications. We reviewed cases of acute mastoiditis to document: (1) incidence of intracranial complications; (2) risk factors; and (3) identify pathologic organisms. METHODS: A retrospective study of children at a tertiary care children's hospital with acute mastoiditis from July, 1986 through June, 1998. RESULTS: 118 children with acute mastoiditis were identified. Eight patients (6.8%), ages 20 months to 14 years, had intracranial complications related to acute mastoiditis. Three children had a sigmoid sinus thrombosis, two children had an epidural abscess, and two children had both complications of sigmoid sinus thrombosis and epidural abscess, and a sigmoid sinus thrombosis and meningitis was present in one child. Pre-admission oral antibiotics were administered for an average of 10 days in seven of the eight patients. Persistent otorrhea and/or otalgia were present in all patients. Intraoperative cultures were negative in four cases (50%). Organisms isolated included: Streptococcus pneumoniae (2); Proteus mirabilis (1); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1); and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1). Multi-drug resistant organisms were documented in only one case. All patients underwent a contrast enhanced CT of the temporal bones and brain. Surgical management included complete mastoidectomy in all patients and a pressure equalization tube in seven of the eight cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our review did not document an increase in the incidence of otitic intracranial complications. Persistent otalgia or otorrhea while on oral antibiotics with associated neurologic symptoms are ominous signs suggestive of a complication. Multi-drug resistant organisms are uncommon whereas negative intraoperative cultures are common.
