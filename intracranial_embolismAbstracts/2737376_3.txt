The importance of socio-economic conditions in the causation of postnatally-acquired cerebral palsy has not been stressed in previous studies. A comparative survey was undertaken in Cape Town, South Africa. Three ethnic groups were compared--white, coloured (mixed ancestry) and black. The percentage of postnatally-acquired cerebral palsy in these groups was 13.2, 24.0 and 36.1 per cent, respectively. These figures can be explained by the differing socio-economic conditions of each group, the white group belonging to the highest socio-economic stratum and the black group to the lowest. The main causes of postnatally-acquired cerebral palsy were cerebral infections (particularly meningitis), cerebral trauma and cerebrovascular accidents. The proportion in each group, the main causal factors, age at onset, types of cerebral palsy and intellectual status are similar to those of most previous studies.
