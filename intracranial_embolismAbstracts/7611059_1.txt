Two patients with giant basilar tip aneurysms underwent coil embolization, one with both platinum fiber and platinum Guglielmi detachable coils and the other with Guglielmi detachable coils only. In both cases, spontaneous intraaneurysmal thrombosis occurred outside the coil mass, presumably a result of disruption of the intraaneurysmal flow pattern.
