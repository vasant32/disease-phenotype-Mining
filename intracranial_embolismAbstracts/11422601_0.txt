Few studies have focused on the relationship between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for postmenopausal women or those with breast cancer and the occurrence of cerebral embolism. Results are conflicting as to whether there is a link between the two. We describe three patients who experienced cerebral embolism during HRT. A 73-year-old woman had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 6 years prior to the present admission. She then took HRT oestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate for about 6 years. The HRT had been prescribed by a gynaecologist for amelioration of postmenopausal symptoms. Six years after beginning HRT, she experienced sudden onset left hemiparesis due to cerebral embolism. Two other patients had been taking HRT for breast cancers. One, a 47-year-old woman, had taken medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than one year, for recurrence of breast cancer. She had developed sudden complete left hemiparesis due to an embolism at the carotid bifurcation. The other patient, a 72-year-old woman who was taking tamoxifen citrate for prevention of breast cancer relapse, experienced cerebral embolism just 2 months after beginning tamoxifen. The risk of cerebral embolism in those on HRT should be emphasized, along with the beneficial effects in terms of postmenopausal symptoms and prevention of breast cancer recurrence.
