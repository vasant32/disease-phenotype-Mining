Sixty asymptomatic patients (age 26 +/- 10 years) with chronic severe aortic regurgitation were followed prospectively for 2.4 +/- 1.4 years. Based on previous echocardiographic end-systolic dimension (ESD) and angiographic ejection fraction (EF) correlations, the cohort was divided into group A (21 patients) with ESD greater than or equal to 48 mm and group B (39 patients) with ESD less than 48 mm. Group B had a faster ESD progression (NS) and 19 crossed over to group A. Thirteen patients, all with ESD greater than 48 mm, reached designated end points. One died of cerebral embolism and 12 (age 31.4 +/- 10.6 years) required aortic valve replacement (AVR). Of these, 9 of 12 were asymptomatic and 11 of 12 had significant left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). The preoperative ESD of 51.9 +/- 4.1 mm fell to 38.4 +/- 3.6 mm (p less than 0.001) postoperatively and the EF of 43.7 +/- 4.16 increased to 64.9 +/- 5.9 (p less than 0.001). We found (1) the progression was faster than in other series; (2) ESD greater than 48 mm was associated with significant progression; and (3) patients with EF above 40% showed no residual LVD after AVR.
