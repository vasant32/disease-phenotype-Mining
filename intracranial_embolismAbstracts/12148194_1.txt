 MATERIAL: 26 patients (17 female, 9 male) from 5 centers were evaluated. The age at the beginning of treatment ranged from 6 to 29 years (mean 13.8). The cause of short stature in 19 patients was achondroplasia or pseudoachondroplasia, in next 2--other bone dysplasias. The other 5 patients had not bone pathology and were treated because of cosmetic indications. Preoperative body height ranged from 90 to 149 cm (mean 120). Axial deviations of the lower extremities were noted in 11 patients. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years. METHOD OF TREATMENT: Most of patients were treated with Ilizarov device using cross lengthening strategy (2 stages--opposite femur and tibia lengthening). Mean duration of treatment including interval between two stages (mean 12 months) was 29 months. Planned increase of body height ranged from 10 to 26 cm (mean 16.4). RESULTS: Planned or greater lengthening (mean 14.8 cm) was achieved in 14 patients. Partial planned lengthening (mean 65% of planned lengthening) was achieved in 8 patients (mean 11.8 cm) including two patients who resigned the second stage of treatment. In two patients lengthening was stopped during first month of treatment because of great complications. In 2 patients treatment was not completed (interval between first and second stage). Mean increase of body height of patients with complete treatment was 13.1 cm (from 2 to 28). Problems, obstacles and complications were analyzed according to Paley classification. PROBLEMS: There were 24 problems in 15 patient (inflammation process around K wires--15 patients, bone healing disturbances--3, regenerate fracture--2, transient foot equinus--2 and axial deviation of the lower extremity--1). OBSTACLES: There were 31 obstacles in 19 patients (regenerate's defect--7 patients, premature bone consolidation--6, foot equinus--4 and other--14). COMPLICATIONS: There were 26 complications in 18 patients (axial deviation of the lengthened segment--8, foot equinus--6, paresis of the peroneal nerve--3, fractures--2 and other--5). The most serious complication was hemiparesis after cerebral embolism (1 patient) and damaging of the femoral artery (1 patient) both disrupting bone lengthening. CONCLUSION: The risk of complication in surgical treatment of short stature patients is high. Qualification for short stature treatment because of cosmetic indication should be made very careful and after precise psychological and/or psychiatric investigation.
