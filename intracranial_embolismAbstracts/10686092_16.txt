The combination of thrombolysis with neuroprotection, because of different mechanisms, would be expected to show better results when used after onset of focal ischemia. In this study we report our experience with the neuronal protective effects of citicoline alone and in combination with urokinase in a model of focal ischemia. Both medications were injected 2 h after onset of a focal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats. Focal ischemia was produced with embolization of a clot into the origin of the MCA. This produces a large infarction involving the cortex and the basal ganglia. Animals were observed for neuronal deficts at 2 and 24 h after surgery and were sacrificed 72 h after onset of ischemia. Saline-treated animals showed a large infarction involving the cerebral cortex and basal ganglion in most animals (volume 33.1 +/- 9.7%). Animals treated with citicoline alone were divided in two groups. The first group of animals were treated with a single injection (300 mg/kg, ip) of the medication 2 h after the arterial occlusion. The second group was treated with the active medication intermittently (3 x 300 mg/kg, ip) over a 72-h period. There was a significant decrease in the neuronal damage in the cortex in the animals treated with citicoline (single dose, 20.9 +/- 9.7%, P = 0.01; intermittent injection, 18.9 +/- 11.4%, P < 0.008). The last experiment evaluated the usefulness of the combination of citicoline with intraarterial urokinase. The combination showed significantly more protection than with urokinase or citicoline alone (volume 13.6 +/- 9.1%, P < 0.001). We conclude from our experiments that citicoline may offer significant neuronal protection that may be further enhanced with the addition of a thrombolytic agent.
