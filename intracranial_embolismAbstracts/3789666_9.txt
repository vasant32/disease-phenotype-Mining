Since controversy continues concerning the value of routine electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and selective carotid bypass shunting, we reviewed the neurological morbidity and mortality following elective carotid endarterectomy in 172 patients with symptomatic carotid occlusive disease. The use of EEG monitoring and selective shunting was associated with a reduction in the frequency of carotid shunts (49 to 12%) and a decline in combined major neurological morbidity and mortality (2.3 to 1.1%). We conclude that the routine use of intraoperative EEG monitoring is a valuable procedure, particularly in patients at high risk for perioperative neurological complications.
