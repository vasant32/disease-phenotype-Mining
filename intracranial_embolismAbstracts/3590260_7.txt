The authors report an autopsy case with repeated transient ischemic attacks and subsequent strokes demonstrating evidence of artery-to-artery embolism from thrombi generated in the stenotic middle cerebral artery to the distal cortical branches. This case substantiates the existence of intracranial artery-to-artery embolism as a cause of transient ischemic attacks and subsequent strokes, and has potential relevance for therapy.
