Cerebral infarction due to chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after thromboexclusion for thoracic dissecting aortic aneurysma is described. Chronic DIC may be caused by the delay of thrombus formation at the site of thromboexclusion, and local DIC occurred at that site. It is difficult to find chronic DIC. This case shows that DIC after thromboexclusion for dissecting aortic aneurysma may be one of the causes of recurrent cerebral infarction.
