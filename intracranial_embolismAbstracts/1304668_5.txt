In this study we investigated the efficacy of an initial compression to 6 atm abs on a 53% nitrogen:47% oxygen mixture (PO2 = 2.8 atm abs) before breathing oxygen at 2.8 and 1.9 atm abs for the treatment of feline cerebral arterial gas embolism. Neurophysiologic function was determined by measuring the cortical somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) amplitude in anesthetized ventilated cats. Air was infused into the carotid artery until the SEP amplitude was reduced to less than 10% of baseline values. The animals were randomly separated into 3 groups. The first group (CONTROL) (n = 7) served as control and remained at the surface, breathing air. The second group (NITROX) (n = 10) was compressed to 6 atm abs breathing a 53:47% nitrox mixture for 30 min followed by breathing 100% oxygen at 2.8 and 1.9 atm abs. The third group (HBO) (n = 10) was compressed to 2.8 and 1.9 atm abs breathing 100% oxygen. Air infusion suppressed the SEP amplitude to the same level in all groups. The CONTROL group recovered 27.6 +/- 31.2% (mean +/- standard deviation) of the baseline SEP amplitude, whereas the NITROX group recovered 63.2 +/- 28.2%, and the HBO group recovered 66.0 +/- 19.3%. An analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed that both treatment profiles promote significant (P = 0.03) recovery of the SEP amplitude compared to no treatment. We find no additional benefit, however, by initiating treatment at 6 atm abs, even when additional oxygen is provided.
