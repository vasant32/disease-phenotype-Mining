Assessments of mood disturbance and "vegetative" (appetite or sleep) disturbance as well as a single-dose dexamethasone suppression test (DST) were carried out in 25 randomly selected stroke patients and in 13 nonstroke control patients hospitalized in a rehabilitation center. Prevalence rates of moderate-to-serve depression of mood and vegetative disturbance were significantly higher in stroke patients than controls (48% and 52% versus 0% and 8%, respectively), as was the prevalence of abnormal DST results (52% versus 8%). Abnormal DST results were associated with the occurrence of moderate to severe mood, appetite, and sleep disturbances among all patients. in 2 stroke patients, repeated DST results paralleled the clinical course. The DST may be useful as an adjunct to the diagnosis and in monitoring the progress of the common and potentially reversible mood and vegetative disturbances occurring after stroke.
