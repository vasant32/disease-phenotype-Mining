We report the case of a young woman with a transient ischemic attack secondary to a rare intracardiac tumor, a papillary fibroelastoma. The tumor was identified by two-dimensional echocardiography and was treated surgically. The intracardiac papillary fibroelastoma as an uncommon source of occult cerebral emboli is discussed.
