A 71-year-old man sustains multiple fractures in an accident; after a lucid interval he deteriorates neurologically and becomes comatose. Intracranial hemorrhage, status epilepticus, adverse drug reactions, toxic-metabolic, ischemic or infectious causes are subsequently ruled out. Development of petechiae and thrombopenia raises the possibility of fat embolism syndrome, which is confirmed in a MRI of the head 72 hours after the accident. We discuss current aetiologic concepts as well as diagnosis and clinical course of the cerebral fat embolism syndrome.
