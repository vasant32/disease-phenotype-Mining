Stroke continues to be a serious socioeconomic problem in the industrialized countries. The three disease processes responsible for most ischemic cerebrovascular events (CVE) are large-vessel and small-vessel atherothrombotic disease and, in up to 20-30% of cases, cardiac embolism. Data from the literature show that life expectancy after CVE is mainly dependent on the coexistence of cardiac disease. It is the responsibility of the cardiologist to exclude or identify the source of cardiac embolism and to initiate adequate treatment for the prevention of recurrences, as well as to diagnose, and treat any concomitant cardiac disease which may be present. We propose a cost-effective algorithmic approach to help the cardiologist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with transient ischemic attacks and ischemic stroke.
