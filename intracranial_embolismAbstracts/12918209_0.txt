The article deals with diagnosis and treatment of fat embolism concomitant with trauma. A new term is suggested, i.e. liqoroglobulism, which is concomitant with the cerebral form of fat embolism. The results of investigations of patients, who endured fat embolism, are presented. A new method is suggested for the treatment of fat embolism, i.e. a combination of hemosorption and liquosorption. A thesis on that the blood-brain barrier is damaged in the cerebral form of fat embolism is formulated.
