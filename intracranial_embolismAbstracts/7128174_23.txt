One hundred subjects (50 men, 50 women), of whom 80 had suffered a unilateral cerebrovascular accident (40 left, 40 right), were tested on the WAIS. In the case of left hemisphere damage the male patients showed lower Verbal than Performance Scale IQ scores; for the right brain damaged men Performance Scale scores were Lower than their scores on the Verbal Scale. Women with unilateral brain damage showed no such reliable discrepancies between their Verbal and Performance Scale scores. This difference in the patterning of WAIS IQs in male and female stroke patients persisted even after the scores of those few patients with any significant degree of expressive aphasia had been excluded from consideration.
