38 autopsied cases of cerebral sinus-vein thrombosis (CSVT) in our institute were studied. In this study, special attention was paid for the evolution and fate of venous thrombus. 18 cases showed hemorrhagic infarction or intracerebral hematoma (group 1; G 1). In contrast, no cerebral parenchymal changes were observed in the other 20 cases (group 2; G 2). In 13 of 18 cases of G 1, superior sagittal sinus (SSS) were thrombosed. 10 of these 13 cases showed thrombosed cerebral cortical veins (CV) or deep cerebral veins (DV). In contrast, none of 16 cases of G 1 with thrombosed SSS showed thrombosed CV or DV. All cases of the solitary thrombosis of CV or DV (each 2 cases) belong to G 1. Venous thrombi were divided into three stages according to its process of organization; recent thrombus (R), hyalinized thrombus (H), organized thrombus (O). In the venous thrombi of G 1, 6 cases were R, 6 were partly H, 6 were partly 0. In addition to O, R and H were also observed in group O. Distribution of various stage of thrombus in same case suggested that gradual thrombus evolution had occurred before or after the clinical onset in CSVT. This study suggested: (1) CV or DV occlusion may play an important role for the advent of cerebral parenchymal changes in CSVT. (2) Gradual thrombus evolution after the onset is one of possible causes of slow clinical deteoration after the onset. Therefore, prevention of these thrombus propagation with anti-platelet drugs or fibrinolotic therapy should be recommended for the treatment of CSVT. On the contrary, hyperosmolar agents and diuretics may produce potential risk of dehydration, and as a result, accelerate secondary thrombus extension.
