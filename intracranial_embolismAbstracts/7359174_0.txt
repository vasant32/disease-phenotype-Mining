Because of the demonstrated suitability of the guinea pig (Cuvis cobaya) for a large variety of laboratory investigations, we sought to develop a stroke model in this animal. Many ingenious stroke models in other animals exist; some depend on anomalous anatomy, others utilize methods of intracranial or extracranial vascular occlusion and yet others combine ischemia and anoxic damage (1-14). As one proposed application for this work was to study immune responses following experimental stroke, survival of several days after cerebral infarction was a requirement. Three to five days elapse before detection of a hymoral and cellular immune response is possible. The guinea pig is especially suited to immunological studies because of the enormous amount of accumulated data on the immunology of this animal. However, the guinea pig has proved relatively invulnerable to existing small animal techniques. Moreover the unacceptably short postoperative survival associated with the use of existing techniques necessitated the development of a new procedure. We have successfully pursued the development of an embolic stroke procedure applicable to this animal.
