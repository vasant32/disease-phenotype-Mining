Intracranial microembolic signals, probably caused by gaseous emboli, are readily detectable in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation in the left side of the heart only. Clinical value of the detected signals could not be equivocably assessed, because only 2 of the patients who were examined (both emboli positive) had transient neurologic symptoms.
