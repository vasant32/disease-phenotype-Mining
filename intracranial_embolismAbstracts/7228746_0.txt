Complications of otitic origin are still possible despite introduction of antibiotica. The number, however, has been reduced not only because of better conservative treatment but because of early operations in acute and chronic suppurative otitis media. 232 patients with otitic pathology showed in 173 cases affections of the labyrinthine and in 59 cases intracranial complications. Statistical results of the different findings before and after operations are given and discussed.
