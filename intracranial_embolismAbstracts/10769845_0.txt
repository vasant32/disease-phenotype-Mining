A 54-year-old woman complaining of left hemiplegia was transferred to our hospital. Computed tomography on admission demonstrated normal. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was decreased in both the cortex and the perforator territory of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA), whereas the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the cortex was normal. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed an occlusion of the right MCA (M 1 proximal) with collateral flow from the right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) to the territory of the right MCA. After intra-arterial injection of tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA), DSA showed partial recanalization, and the symptoms of the patient improved considerably. Five days after that, the patient deteriorated again and showed disturbance of consciousness and left hemiplegia. In this episode, both CBF and ADC in the cortex of the right MCA were decreased. DSA revealed an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and collateral flow from the right ACA to the territory of the right MCA disappeared. After intra-arterial injection of t-PA, DSA showed partial recanalization with collateral flow from the right ACA, and the symptoms of the patient improved. DSA 5 weeks after onset showed complete recanalization of both the right MCA and the ICA. The patient was diagnosed as both mitral and aortic stenosis and regurgitation (MSR + ASR) and underwent an operation for both mitral and aortic value replacement. She was discharged with no neurological deficit 4 months after onset. ADC analysis is especially useful for the prediction of reversible ischemic damage and the prevention of hemorrhagic transformation and fatal edema in acute ischemic stroke.
