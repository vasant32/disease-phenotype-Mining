A 65-year-old male presented with rapidly progressive paraparesis and akinetic mutism due to occlusion of the bihemispheric anterior cerebral artery (ACA). He was treated by intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy but reocclusion of the arteriosclerotic lesion occurred. Bilateral superficial temporal artery (STA)-ACA anastomoses achieved lasting neurological improvement. Bilateral STA-ACA anastomoses are quite effective to prevent ischemia of the bilateral ACA territories.
