Transesophageal echocardiography is often the diagnostic modality used for evaluation of cardiovascular sources of cerebral emboli. While invasive, TEE has proven to be a safe diagnostic method. However, TEE may have hemodynamic consequences within the procedure that are potentially hazardous to the specific population of acute ischemic stroke patients. As the case study and resultant discussion illustrated, specific interventions may theoretically interrupt the possible mechanisms responsible for the precipitous decrease in blood pressure. Further investigation of methods to prevent precipitous decrease in blood pressure and to identify potential negative outcomes for ischemic stroke patients must continue within the clinical setting.
