Two newborn infants with respiratory distress syndrome developed massive systemic air embolisms and pneumoencephaly. These complications occurred during positive-pressure ventilation therapy. Intracranial gas was probably due to the rupture of cerebral vessels secondary to systemic gas embolism. The diagnostic features of plain radiographs, computed tomography, and ultrasonography in the evaluation of this unusual entity are described. The importance of early CT scans of the head is emphasized.
