Recent progress in the measurements of the hemostatic markers enables us to assess the detailed profiles of hemostatic activation in various diseases. To evaluate the degree of hemostatic system activation in patients with cerebral thrombosis, detailed coagulation studies were performed in 28 patients with acute-phase cerebral thrombosis and in 36 with chronic-phase cerebral thrombosis, together with 6 with chronic-phase cerebral hemorrhage and 37 age-matched healthy volunteers. In both acute-phase and chronic-phase cerebral thrombosis, plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex, plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex and D-dimer were significantly higher, and antithrombin III and protein C were significantly lower than those in the normal group. Plasma fibrinogen concentration was significantly higher in chronic-phase cerebral thrombosis than that in chronic-phase cerebral hemorrhage. No significant difference was found in these variables between acute-phase and chronic-phase cerebral thrombosis. In addition, there was no difference in these parameters between chronic phase cerebral hemorrhage and normal subjects. These findings indicate that a sustained activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis is present in cerebral thrombosis, and it might contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral thrombosis.
