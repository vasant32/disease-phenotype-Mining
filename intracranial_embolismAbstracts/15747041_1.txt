BACKGROUND: Stenting of isolated proximal LAD stenoses is still a controversial issue since it is associated with higher target vessel revascularization (TVR) rate than both bypass surgery using the internal mammary artery, and stenting of other coronary artery territories. The sirolimus- eluting stent (SES) has been reported to significantly reduce restenosis rates in de novo coronary lesions. Therefore, we compared patients from the German Cypher Registry treated with SES for isolated proximal LAD lesions with those stented for isolated lesions in the proximal LCX or RCA. METHODS: A total of 349 patients treated with SES were analyzed. 249 patients were treated for proximal LAD stenosis, and 100 for proximal LCX/RCA stenoses. The combined clinical endpoint was MACCE (death of any cause, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke) and TVR at 6 months. RESULTS: In-hospital events (death, MI and TVR) did not differ significantly between both groups (3.2% for the LAD group vs 2.0% for the LCX/RCA-group, p=0.73). The combined end point of death of any cause, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke at six months was 2.6% in the LAD group, and 2.2% in the LCX/RCA group (p=1.0). TVR occurred in 4.8% of the LAD group and in 6.5% of the LCX/RCA group at six months (p=0.58). The percentage of patients free from angina at daily activities was 80.6% in the LAD group, and 77.4% in the LCX/ RCA group (p=0.52). CONCLUSION: SES once implanted into isolated proximal LAD stenoses appears as effective as reported in other vessel territories. Accordingly, stenting of the proximal LAD using SES might prove a suitable alternative to surgery.
