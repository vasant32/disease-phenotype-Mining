In a prospective study of 2,384 persons, mean age 81 years, at 44-month follow-up, new thromboembolic stroke developed in 510 of 2,384 persons (21%). The Cox regression model showed that significant independent risk factors for new thromboembolic stroke were atrial fibrillation (risk ratio 3.2), left ventricular hypertrophy (risk ratio 2.8), prior stroke (risk ratio 2.2), and male gender (risk ratio 1.2).
