OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of endovascular treatment of inoperable cerebral aneurysms using electrolytically detachable platinum coils (Gugliemi Detachable Coils, GDC). DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: St. Elizabeth Hospital Tilburg, the Netherlands. METHOD: Fifteen aneurysms in 13 patients were treated using GDC; 14 of these aneurysms were inoperable and in three aneurysms surgical clipping had failed. RESULTS: Twelve of the 15 treated aneurysms were completely occluded. In another two, occlusion was 90% and in one, 70%. One patient with an inoperable basilar bifurcation aneurysm died of progressive thrombosis of both posterior cerebral arteries. One patient with an inoperable aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery developed an infarction of the A. centralis longa (recurrent artery of Heubner). CONCLUSION: GDC treatment of inoperable cerebral aneurysms is currently the only available option with a reasonable chance of success and acceptable risks.
