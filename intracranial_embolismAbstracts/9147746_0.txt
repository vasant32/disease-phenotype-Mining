INTRODUCTION: Pathological laughter occurs in pseudobulbar paralysis, in psychiatric disorders and as a sign of convulsions (gelastic crisis). An extremely rare form is the "fou rire prodromique' a pathological episode of laughter preceding a stroke. The pathogenesis is unknown and classically differentiated from gelastic crises. "Fou rire prodromique' has been described in subcortical ischaemic or haemorrhagic strokes, not in cortical strokes. CLINICAL CASE: We describe a patient with an ischaemic cerebrovascular accident due to embolism of the left Sylvian artery. The clinical picture started with a short episode of pathological laughter which preceded sensitive aphasia and weakness of the right limbs. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that in the case described it is impossible to differentiate between the "fou rire prodromique' and a gelastic crisis as a first sign of an embolic cerebrovascular accident.
