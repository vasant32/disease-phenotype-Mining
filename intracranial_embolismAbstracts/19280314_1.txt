Primary cardiac tumors are rare. Hemangiomas represent about 5%-10% of benign cardiac tumors. Hemangiomas can be found in any heart chamber, but atria have been more frequently involved. Ventricular involvement is uncommon. Hemangiomas may have various presentations, but there have been few reports about neurological manifestations of such tumors in the English-language literature. We present a patient with a left ventricular hemangioma who presented with leftsided weakness and sudden onset of slurred speech.
