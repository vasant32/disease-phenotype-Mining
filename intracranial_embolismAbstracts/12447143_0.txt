Paradoxical embolism (PE) is an uncommonly diagnosed cause of unexplained ischemic cerebral event. Its diagnosis is based on established criteria and the failure to identify an arterial or cardiac embolic source. The association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke has repeatedly been demonstrated in clinical studies. Transesophageal contrast echocardiography is the best diagnostic test. Surgical or endovascular PFO closure is recommended for the long-term prevention of PE.
