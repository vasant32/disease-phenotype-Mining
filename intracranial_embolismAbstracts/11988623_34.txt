BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been proposed that the novel spin trap agent disodium-[(tert-butylimino)methyl]benzene-1,3-disulfonate N-oxide (NXY-059) may be useful in the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, there is little information concerning the neuroprotective properties of NXY-059 when administered after an embolic stroke. Moreover, there is no information available concerning the combination of NXY-059 with the only Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological agent for the treatment of acute stroke, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Thus, we determined the effects of NXY-059G, a generic form of NXY-059, on behavioral outcome after an embolic stroke when administered alone or in combination with tPA. METHODS: Male New Zealand White rabbits were embolized by injecting a suspension of small blood clots into cerebral circulation via a carotid catheter. NXY-059G (100 mg/kg) was infused intravenously 5 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, whereas control rabbits received infusions of the saline vehicle. In tPA studies, the thrombolytic was administered intravenously starting 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization (3.3 mg/kg). In combination studies, NXY-059G was given 5 minutes after embolization, followed by the administration of tPA beginning either 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization. Behavioral analysis was conducted 24 hours after embolization. RESULTS: In the vehicle control group, the ES50 value (calculated as the amount of microclots [milligrams] that produce neurological dysfunction [impairment] in 50% of the rabbits within a specific treatment group) measured 24 hours after embolism was 1.04+/-0.31 mg, and this was increased by 153% to 2.54+/-0.72 mg if NXY-059G was administered beginning 5 minutes after embolization. However, if NXY-059G was administered beginning 3 hours after embolization, the ES50 was 2.01+/-0.40 mg. The rabbits treated with tPA alone had an ES50 of 2.64+/-0.66 or 0.63+/-0.35 mg if tPA administration started 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, respectively. If tPA was administered after NXY-059G (started at 5 minutes), the ES50 values were 3.15+/-0.50 or 2.66+/-0.82 if tPA administration started 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NXY-059G is neuroprotective and can increase behavioral ratings if administered early after an embolic stroke. In addition, the study shows that NXY-059G can be used in combination with tPA without negative side effects. The drug combination can improve behavioral function and increase ES50 values. However, during the short time course of the behavioral analysis, the combination was not statistically better than either drug alone.
