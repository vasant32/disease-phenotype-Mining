We report five patients with intracranial vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms, all of whom had ischemic symptoms. Angiographically, four of the five cases revealed distention and elongation of the vertebrobasilar artery like dolichoectasia and one irregular stenosis, the so-called "string sign". Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed all dolichoectatic dissecting lesions by demonstrating intimal flaps, double lumen, or subacute clot in the false lumen. We also present a successful demonstration of slow flow in the false lumen by gradient refocused magnetic resonance imaging scan with partial flip angle by the cardiac gating method. It is suggested that many of the classical "dolichoectasia" may include dissecting lesions.
