Thromboses of cerebral veins and sinus occur both in childhood and in adult age. The clinical symptoms are variable, so that until a few years ago the diagnosis had been based exclusively on angjiography. Owing to the introduction of computer tomography, a method has now become available to the clinician which, while it does not involve great risks and stress for the patient, is of great importance in the diagnosis of thromboses of cerebral veins and sinus, especially for the observation of the course of the disease and the therapy to be employed. This is particularly true of the indication for thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy. The computertomographic findings are described on the basis of the literature and two own observations, differentiating between direct and indirect symptoms. All changes are inconstant, which makes the appraisal difficult. At the time being, the angiographic diagnosis can rarely be renounced. Both examination methods supplement each other very well.
