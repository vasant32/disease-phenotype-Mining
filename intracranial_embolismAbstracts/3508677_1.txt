Tuberous sclerosis was diagnosed in an infant girl during the first 3 days of life on the basis of electrocardiographic and cranial computed tomographic abnormalities. At 19 months of age, neurologic deterioration occurred and repeat computed tomography documented several new cortical lesions while the subaortic mass was markedly reduced in size. The sequence of events suggested cerebral embolization by the cardiac tumor.
