The authors describe the clinical, pathological, and therapeutic aspects of a case of focal temporal lobe eosinophilic granuloma, presenting with otitis media and meningitis, and evolving subsequently into a temporal lobe mass. This triad, otitis media, meningitis, focal cerebral lesion with systemic manifestations of inflammation, eosinophilia of blood and cerebrospinal fluid, should suggest eosinophilic granuloma in the differential diagnosis. The lesion is sensitive to relatively small doses of radiation.
