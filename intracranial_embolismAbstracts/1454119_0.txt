Eighty-four patients with ischaemic stroke aged 18-50 years were analysed. They had been treated in the years 1985-1989. Forty-five of them were followed up. In a high proportion of cases stroke was a result of thrombosis. Many risk factors were found in this group, mainly hypertension. In most cases stroke was serious, in several cases post-stroke epilepsy and poly-infarction dementia developed.
