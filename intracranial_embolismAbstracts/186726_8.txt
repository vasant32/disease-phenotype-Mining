Seventy-nine autopsy correlations of CT scans showed (1) excellent correlations in normal brains, but the size of the lateral ventricles consistently larger during life than after death; (2) a distinctive pattern differentiating obstructive from nonobstructive hydrocephalus; (3) infarctions appearing as areas of decreased densities of parenchyma in vascular distributions; (4) distinctive high density appearances of hemorrhages that differentiated them from infarctions and, in general, all other pathologic processes; (5) supratentorial, intraventricular, and posterior fossa tumors appearing as masses that displaced, distorted, collapsed, and enlarged normal spaces and structures such as ventricles and pineal gland; (6) 11 false-negative CT scans in some cases of brain stem infarction, brain stem hemorrhage, and small metastasis; and (7) an overall accuracy of 86.2 percent of CT scanning in correctly identifying pathology of the brain.
