OBJECTIVE: To compare the curative effect of Cox/maze III procedure combined with mitral replacement and that of mitral valve replacement (MVR). METHODS: Fifty-six patients suffering from rheumatic heart disease with atrial fibrillation (AF) were treated by Cox/maze III procedure combined with MVR (maze group). Another 56 age, sex, and heart function-matched patients with the same diagnosis underwent MVR alone during the same period. Warfarin was administered after operation in both groups. Comparison of operative complication and curative effects was made. RESULTS: The aortic cross-clamp time and cardio pulmonary bypass time (CPB) were longer in maze group than in MVT group (75 +/- 22 min vs 41 +/- 11 min, P < 0.05 and 124 +/- 40 min VS 68 +/- 19 min, P < 0.05). Bleeding happened after the heart reatored beating in 2 patients in maze group and in one patient in MVT group, all these 3 patients responding satisfactorily to hemostasis. The early post-operative mortality was 1.79% (1/56) in both groups. In maze group, AF disappeared in all patients but one who had node rhythm. Normal sinus rhythm was restored in 98.18% of the patients (54/55). Atrial contractility was restored in all patients with sinus rhythm. One year after operation, 98.18% patients' cardiac function changed to grade and 1.82% changed to grade II. In MVR group AF disappeared after operation temporarily for 24 hours in 7 patients and re-appeared, and AF disappeared in one patients for 2 years so far. One year after operation, the cardiac function of 94.6% patients in MVR group changed to grade I, of 3.6% patients to grade II, and of 1.8% patients to grade III. No serious hemorrhage relate d to anticoagulant therapy happened. One patient in MVR group suffered from hemiplegia due to cerebral embolism. The late mortality was 1.8% on maze group amd 3.6% in MVR group. CONCLUSION: Cox/maze III procedure combined with NVR is safe and effective in treating rheumatic heart disease with AF.
