Clinical records were reviewed to analyse occurrence of hypertension and other risk factors that may predispose to the development of lacunar stroke. The comparison of risk factors associated with deep, small, ischaemic lesions of the brain (revealed in 67% by CT, in 31% by MRI and in 2% by autopsy) and large superficial or superficial and deep ischaemic lesions (diagnosed in 89% by CT, 4% by MRI and 7% by autopsy) was done. Hypertension, treated and untreated, was more frequent in lacunar stroke, but the difference was not statistically significant. Statistically significant difference was found in large stenotic lesions of internal carotid artery, which were more common in patients with large superficial or superficial and deep lesions (watershed area) and in moderate stenotic lesions of internal carotid artery, which were more common in patients with lacunar stroke. The results suggests that lacunar stroke may be caused by cerebral embolism from carotid sources.
