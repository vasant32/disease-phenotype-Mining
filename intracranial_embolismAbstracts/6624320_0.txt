Clinical, echoelectroencephalographic and pathomorphological study in 73 patients with grave ischemic insult in arteria cerebralis media region was performed. Brain infarctions caused by thrombosis were characterized by small M-echo displacement 12 hours after process beginning followed by displacement increase in 3-4 days. Brain infarctions caused by thromboembolic process were characterized by small M-echo displacement 6 hours after accident with subsequent fast increase of displacement till mean or great values in the second half of the first day. Supratentorial brain infarctions not connected with thrombosis were not accompanied by M-echo displacement.
