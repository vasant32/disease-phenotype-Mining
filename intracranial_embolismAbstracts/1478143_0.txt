Non-activated platelet cytoplasmic ionized calcium was measured in Aequorin-loaded Gel-filtered platelets in 43 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 32 healthy controls. Platelet cytoplasmic ionized calcium is 2,596 +/- 0,674 mumol/L in controls, 3,370 +/- 1,339 mumol/L in the patients with acute ischemic stroke. Platelet cytoplasmic ionized calcium is increased in the stroke patients as compared to controls (P < 0.01). This indicates that there may be a lower threshold in platelet of stroke patient for activation. Moreover, increased platelet cytoplasmic ionized calcium may be a risk factor for thrombus propagation and aggravation of clinical manifestation.
