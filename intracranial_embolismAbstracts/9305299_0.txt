We describe 15 malpractice claims that were filed after the patients had strokes. Both embolic and thrombotic, sterile and infected strokes led to claims. Ten of the claims alleged physician failure to protect the patient, two alleged physician failure to react as called for by symptoms, and three were related to medication. We conclude that physicians should advise patients of the possibility of stroke when circumstances warrant it, as well as documenting their judgment and suggested preventive practices. These cases further suggest that treatment decisions supported by documented second opinions may reduce the number of malpractice claims for strokes.
