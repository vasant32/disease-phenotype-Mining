The radiographic examinations and hospital records of 93 young adult patients (15-45 years of age) with nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction evaluated at our institution during the past 9 years were reviewed. The angiographic examinations were abnormal in 76% of patients. The most common abnormalities were embolic disease and atherothrombotic disease. Forty-seven patients underwent angiography within 7 days of their event. There were no major neurologic or systemic complications related to early angiography. We believe that angiography performed early in the course of the illness is a high-yield, safe procedure that may significantly alter the management of acute stroke in young adults.
