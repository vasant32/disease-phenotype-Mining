The apparently paradoxical appearance of increased vascularity appearing in the radionuclide angiographic studies of a patient with cerebral infarction has recently been described and attributed to the "luxury perfusion syndrome". It is suggested that this phenomenon occurs more frequently than previously thought and in fact has been observed in nine patients presenting for a cerebral scan during a ten-month period. These cases are reviewed and an alternative explanation for the occurrence of increased vascularity on the dynamic study is submitted.
