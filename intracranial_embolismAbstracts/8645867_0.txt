 PURPOSE: To evaluate stroke risk assessment of balloon test occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) with enlarged haemodynamic monitoring prior to permanent ICA occlusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 24 patients with cervical metastasis (n = 18), cavernous meningiomas (n = 3) or inoperable cavernous aneurysms (n = 3) were examined. The test occlusion was monitored by EEG, neurological examinations and transcranial Doppler sonography of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery with evaluation of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity. Additionally 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT imaging was added showing the perfusion during test occlusion. RESULTS: In one (4%) patient the test occlusion had to be interrupted previously due to an acute neurological deficit. This patient and two (8%) patients with highly pathological test results in SPECT and TCD were excluded from permanent carotid occlusion. In 6 (25%) patients quantitative TCD monitoring could improve the stroke risk assessment by differentiating the patients in a low and high risk group. 6 (25%) patients were definitely occluded without haemodynamic complications, but two patients suffered from embolic infarctions which cannot be predicted by this procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal balloon test occlusion with enlarged haemodynamic monitoring allows haemodynamic stroke risk assessment prior to permanent occlusion of the ICA.
