Three patients with suspected iatrogenic cerebral air embolism had cranial CTs performed within 24 hr of onset of symptoms. One was interpreted as normal, one showed a large, right frontoparietal enhancing lesion, and the third showed evidence of bi-thalamic infarction. Follow-up scans 7 to 10 days later showed either single or multiple enhancing infarcts in all patients. Although CT proved a valuable tool in the diagnosis of this condition, one out of three initial studies were negative, necessitating a follow-up scan.
