Cerebral embolism carries significant mortality and morbidity rates. Middle cerebral artery embolectomies which have been carried out in man with variable results, have been reported by different authors, In order to define a time limit for embolectomies before irreversible damage has been incurred, an experimental embolus model was used in dogs. It was observed that embolectomy carried out at 2, 3, and up to 5 hours after embolism was relatively safe and effective. Beyond 5 hours, embolectomy carried an increased risk of death and morbidity.
