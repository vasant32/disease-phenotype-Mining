291 patients were subjected to carotid endarterectomy from January 1985 to June 1992 in two Australian medical institutions. Of the 291 patients, perioperative stroke occurred in 22 (6.3%) after 347 operations (moderate 17 and severe 5). The 22 patients were studied with Doppler scan, angiography, reexploration and CT. Reexploration showed that 12 of 14 patients had thrombosis in the internal carotid artery at operation. The etiological factors for perioperative strokes included thrombosis at the operative sites in 14 patients (64%), cerebral embolism after operation in 4, clamping ischemia in 2, intracerebral hemorrhage in 1 and unknown cause in 1. Six patients (27%) recovered completely in 4 weeks, 10 (45%) had mild residual neurological deficits, 5 (23%) had moderate neurological deficits and 1 died 3 days after operation. Only 6 patients had permanent neurological deficits (6/347, 17%).
