BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effect of ebselen, a seleno-organic compound with antioxidant activity through a glutathione peroxidase-like action, on the outcome of acute ischemic stroke was evaluated in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. METHODS: Patients diagnosed as having acute ischemic stroke who could receive drug treatment within 48 hours of stroke onset were enrolled. Oral administration of ebselen granules suspended in water (150 mg BID) or placebo was started immediately after admission and was continued for 2 weeks. The major end points were the Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 1 month and 3 months after the start of treatment. The modified Mathew Scale and modified Barthel Index scores at 1 month and 3 months were also studied as secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Three hundred two patients were enrolled in the trial. Intent-to-treat analysis of 300 patients (151 given ebselen and 149 given placebo) revealed that ebselen treatment achieved a significantly better outcome than placebo at 1 month (P = .023, Wilcoxon rank sum test) but not at 3 months (P = .056, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The improvement was significant in patients who started ebselen within 24 hours of stroke onset but not in those who started treatment after 24 hours. There was a corresponding improvement in the modified Mathew Scale and modified Barthel Index scores. CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with ebselen improved the outcome of acute ischemic stroke. Ebselen may be a promising neuroprotective agent.
