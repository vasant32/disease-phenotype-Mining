The rupture of a cerebral aneurysm is the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Endovascular embolization of the aneurysms by implantation of Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC) has become a major treatment approach in the prevention of a rupture. Implantation of the coils induces formation of tissues over the coils, embolizing the aneurysm. However, blood entry into the coiled aneurysm often occurs due to failures in the embolization process. Current diagnostic methods used for aneurysms, such as X-ray angiography and computer tomography, are ineffective for continuous monitoring of the disease and require extremely expensive equipment. Here we present a novel technique for wireless monitoring of cerebral aneurysms using implanted embolization coils as radiofrequency resonant sensors that detect the blood entry. The experiments show that commonly used embolization coils could be utilized as electrical inductors or antennas. As the blood flows into a coil-implanted aneurysm, parasitic capacitance of the coil is modified because of the difference in permittivity between the blood and the tissues grown around the coil, resulting in a change in the coil's resonant frequency. The resonances of platinum GDC-like coils embedded in aneurysm models are detected to show average responses of 224-819 MHz/ml to saline injected into the models. This preliminary demonstration indicates a new possibility in the use of implanted GDC as a wireless sensor for embolization failures, the first step toward realizing long-term, noninvasive, and cost-effective remote monitoring of cerebral aneurysms treated with coil embolization.
