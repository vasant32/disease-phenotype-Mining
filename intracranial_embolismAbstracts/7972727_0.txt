Elemental mercury is usually found in the vascular system following intravenous injection. It is distributed in the body in two different ways, which are described in detail. We report the case of a 39-year-old male, who injected elemental mercury in his cubital vein in a suicide attempt. This fact was detected accidentally during clinical treatment. Microemboli of metallic mercury were found in the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, central nervous system and other organs. A high serum concentration of dissolved and oxidized mercury was detected. No signs of chronic mercury intoxication in the form an organic functional disturbance were obvious.
