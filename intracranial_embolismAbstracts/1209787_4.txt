The present investigation was carried out to study the incidence of new cerebrovascular strokes (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction and cerebral embolism) in people under the age of 70. SUCH INFORMATION HAS HITHERTO BEEN LACKING. The material comprises all cases from Uppsala county occurring between 1967 and 1971. The incidence was found to be 36/100,000 inhabitants. Of the total number of strokes, 25% were recurrences. During the period of study the incidence showed a moderate but significant decrease. It is assumed that this decrease is due to an extended and improved treatment of hypertension. It was observed that there were 6 females below 40 years of age. All had been on oral contraceptives at the time of the stroke. There was a high incidence of diabetes and symptoms of cardiovascular impairment (hypertension, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), cardiosclerotic disease) in the series. A high incidence of myocardial infarction was found among the parents of the cases of cerebral haemorrhage. A high incidence of strokes was found among the parents of those having cerebral infarctions.
