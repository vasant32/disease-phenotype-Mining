35 patients with oral anticoagulant (OAC) related intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhage were studied to determine treatment received, outcome and rate of recurrent bleeding and thromboembolism after restarting OAC. All patients underwent active anticoagulant reversal and in 14 patients with prosthetic heart valves (PHV) the INR remained below 2.0 for 0-19d (median 7) with no thromboembolic events. 10 patients received heparin, although a therapeutic level was rarely achieved. 13 patients with PHV were restarted on OAC and followed for a median 23.5 months. One patient had recurrent intracranial bleeding. 3/13 patients had cerebral embolic events despite anticoagulation. We conclude that in PHV patients temporary cessation of OAC is safe and the risk of recurrent bleeding after restarting OAC is low.
