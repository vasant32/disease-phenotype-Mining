Severe calcification of the ascending aorta makes coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) complicated since aortic cross-clamping may induce cerebral embolization of aortic debris or aortic dissection. Furthermore, there are problems that the distal aortic occlusion becomes incomplete and proximal anastomosis between the ascending aorta and saphenous veins becomes impossible. CABG for a 56 year-old male with severely calcified ascending aorta was successfully conducted using hypothermic circulatory arrest technique. His right internal thoracic artery was bypassed to LAD under fibrillatory arrest and then his right gastroepiploic artery was bypassed to the distal portion of RCA under hypothermic circulatory arrest. There was no complication and left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 16% to 38% postoperatively.
