The most effective and safest option for the prevention of atrial fibrillation and its sequelae--cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, stroke)--is primary prophylaxis. Here, the management of arterial hypertension--the most common cause underlying atrial fibrillation--is of considerable importance. In addition to blood pressure reduction, substances with an action of the autonomic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (ACE-inhibitors, AT1 antagonists, beta blockers) have a positive effect on the remodeling, so-called, of the atrial myocytes, and thus on the occurrence of atrial fibrillation with its associated stroke risk. For patients with elevated blood pressure, therefore, the therapeutic strategy should, in the individual case, give consideration to the possibility of exerting a positive effect on atrial fibrillation.
