Two patients with a cerebral embolism were evaluated by using both 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD, or Bicisate) and 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In one patient, 99mTc-ECD SPECT images revealed hypoactivity in a reflow hyperemic area where an infarct was seen later on CT scans. In another patient, a reperfused area showed hyperactivity on 99mTc-ECD SPECT without any abnormality on follow-up CT. 99mTc-ECD represents a potential agent with which to evaluate cerebral tissue viability in early reperfusion after ischemia.
