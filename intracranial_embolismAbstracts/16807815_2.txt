A 55-year-old woman suffered from a bloodstream infection (Staphylococcus aureus), which originated from pump inflow and outflow skin exits, from 4 months after a parocorporeal left ventricular assist device (LVAD) had been implanted. In addition to local irrigation, repeated administration of a weekly unit of cefazolin hydrate was temporarily effective, but fever frequently recurred. Because short-term antibiotic administration had limited effectiveness, a much longer-term course of cefazolin was begun at 14 months post-LVAD implantation and was planned to continue until future transplantation. Unfortunately, the patient died from a cerebral embolism at 19 months after LVAD implantation; long-term consecutive cefazolin administration had suppressed the infection for over 5 months without side effects. To treat intractable LVAD-associated bloodstream infection, long-term administration of a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam drug is an effective option.
