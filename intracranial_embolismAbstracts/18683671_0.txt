The authors present a case of thrombosis on the St. Jude Medical 19 aortic valve prosthesis. The diagnosis was confirmed by transthoracic and transoesofageal echocardiography, cardiac fluoroscopy revealed restricted movement of the aortic valve prosthesis leaflet. Thrombolytic therapy was complicated with brain embolism that was successfully percutaneously removed from the cerebral artery by the mechanical device. The patient has fully recovered without any neurological residual symptoms. This case report should be instructive to other clinicians who encounter the same complications after thrombolytic treatment.
