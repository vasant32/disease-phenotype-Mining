Four patients with cerebral ischemic events related to anemia or therapeutic hemodilution were observed within a 10-month period. Upper gastro-intestinal hemorrhage was responsible in 2 patients. The 3rd suffered from chronic polyarthritis and erosive gastritis, and in the 4th instance, the decrease of hematocrit was the result of a therapeutic hemodilution for polycythemia. A significant carotid stenosis corresponding to the symptoms was diagnosed in all patients. Passage of emboli in the middle cerebral or ophthalmic artery respectively was detected in two patients during the transcranial Doppler exam. Analysis of the effect of a decrease of hematocrit on arterial stenoses suggests that cerebral ischemic events related to blood loss are partially due to induced embolism.
