BACKGROUND: Cerebral embolization as a result of aortic manipulation has emerged as an important risk factor for the incidence of stroke after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPACB). METHODS AND RESULTS: A new surgical technique for proximal anastomosis without using a side-biting clamp or any proximal anastomotic device in OPACB has been developed and successfully used for proximal anastomosis between a great saphenous vein or radial artery graft and the aorta in OPCAB of 138 patients, with good short-term results. CONCLUSIONS: This novel technique proximal anastomosis in OPACB can be completed in a safe, easy and economical fashion.
