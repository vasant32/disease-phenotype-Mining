Changes of Factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIR:Ag) were measured in patients with cerebral thrombosis on day 1-15 (125 cases), 16-45 (acute reaction phase, 70 cases), and during 1.5-5 months (recovery phase, 29 cases) after onset of the disease. FVIIIR:Ag was significantly (P less than 0.001) increased in both acute and recovery phase as compared to 108 healthy controls, although slightly decreased in recovery than in acute phase. The persistently high FVIIIR:Ag levels in acute phase are unlikely to be caused by the so-called acute phase reaction but are probably due to increased synthesis and endothelial changes in atherosclerotic lesions releasing FVIIIR:Ag from its endothelial pool. It suggested that increased FVIIIR:Ag mainly reflects the degree of vascular involvement and it may be used as a marker (or indicator) of arterial endothelial injury in patients with cerebral thrombosis.
