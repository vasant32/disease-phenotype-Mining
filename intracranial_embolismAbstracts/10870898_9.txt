Carotid stenosis severity is a commonly used indicator for assessing risk of stroke. However, the majority of individuals with severe carotid artery disease never suffer a stroke, and strokes can occur even with only mild or moderate stenosis. This suggests local factors (other than stenosis severity) at or near the carotid artery bifurcation may be important in determining stroke risk. In this paper we investigate the effect of stenosis geometry on flow patterns in the stenosed carotid bifurcation, using concentrically and eccentrically stenosed anthropomorphic carotid bifurcation models having identical stenosis severity. Computational simulations and experimental flow visualizations both demonstrate marked differences in flow patterns of concentric and eccentric stenosis models for moderately and severely stenosed cases, respectively. In particular, we identify post-stenotic recirculation zone size and location, and spatial extent of elevated wall shear stress as key factors differing between the two geometries. As these are also rotid plaque more vulnerable to cerebral embolus prokey biophysical factors promoting thrombogenesis, we propose that the stenosed carotid bifurcation geometry--or the induced flow patterns themselves--may provide more specific indicators for those plaques that are vulnerable to enhanced thromboembolic potential, and hence, increased risk of ischemic stroke.
