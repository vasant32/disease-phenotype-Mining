OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of CT angiography in case of clinical signs of acute brainstem infarction for the therapeutic management of catheter-based local thrombolysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3 patients (2 males, 1 female) suffering from an acute onset of brainstem symptoms and being suspicious of an occluded basilar artery were included into this report. 1 patient underwent selective vertebral arteriography. 2 patients were initially examined with CT angiography using a 4-row scanner and 100 ml intravenous contrast agent. RESULTS: In one patient, an occlusion of the basilar artery was excluded with catheter-based angiography. Subsequently, the patient was treated with systemic thrombolysis using r-tPA because of a thalamus infarction seen in MRI. 2 patients who have been initially examined with CT angiography presented with complete occlusions of the basilar arteries. These patients underwent r-tPA thrombolysis by means of superselective micro-catheter approaches of the vertebrobasilar vessels. CT angiography was very useful for determinating the occlusion length of the basilar artery pre-therapeutically, and in 1 case for ruling out an occluded vertrebral artery for catheterization. All patients recovered well under thrombolytic therapy applied systemically or selectively. CONCLUSION: Cerebral multi-slice CT angiography is a fast and save technique for detecting or ruling out an acute basilar artery occlusion. Thus, in cases of equivocal clinical signs CT angiography is recommended before the decision of thrombolytic therapy is made.
