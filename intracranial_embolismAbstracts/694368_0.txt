Angiotomography is a method which is particularly suitable for application in the diagnostics of the vertebrobasilar system on account of its ability to increase the selectivity of angiography, the definition of details, and spatial orientation. Available techniques include angioautomography with and without accessory device, and simultaneous angiotomography and its variations. Among the indications, those are predominant where disturbing vascular overshadowing should be eliminated and certain details emphasized. Angiotomography of the vertebrobasilar system visualizes important vascular structures without overshadowing, and hence also facilitates indirectly the assessment of certain neural structures. The visualization of the contours of vascularized tumors is also improved, and visualization of cystic processes becomes possible. The contrast of discrete tumor staining is enhanced, and, last but not least, visualization of the vessels themselves, as well as of important details, is increased.
