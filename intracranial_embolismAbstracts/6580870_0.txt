The stroke types and major risk factors in 356 patients with cerebrovascular disease were examined. Large artery thrombosis accounted for 53% of strokes, cerebral embolism for 22%, lacunes for 14% and intracerebral hemorrhage for 11%. Hypertension, detected in two-thirds of patients, was the major risk factor. The sex distribution varied with age, the major change being an increase in the number of females affected in older age groups. The extent of systemic vascular disease was greatest in patients with thrombo-embolic infarction.
