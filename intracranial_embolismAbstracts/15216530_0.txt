BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR), multiple microembolic signals (MES) can be detected in cerebral arteries. We sought to characterize composition and clinical relevance of these MES and to evaluate strategies to reduce cerebral microembolization during TMLR. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: TMLR was performed in pigs. Laser energy was set to 4-10 J (group A) or 80 J (group B). Oxygen concentration was varied between 21 and 100%. MES were recorded in the ophthalmic artery. Brain and spinal cord were investigated histologically after 10 days. RESULTS: More MES could be detected during high- compared to low-energy laser procedures. Ventilation with 100% oxygen reduced the number of MES. No lesions were found on histology. CONCLUSIONS: The number of MES depends on the laser energy. Laser-induces cavitation-effects lead to an additional release of nitrogen bubbles. Thus, the microembolic load can be reduced by ventilation with 100% oxygen and by decreasing the laser energy.
