AIM: The aim of this Italian prospective registry was to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of the Mo.Ma Device (Invatec, Roncadelle, Italy) for the prevention of cerebral embolization during carotid artery stenting (CAS) in a real world population. METHODS: In 4 Italian centers, 416 patients (300 men; mean age 71.6+/-9 years) between October 2001 and March 2005 were enrolled in a prospective registry. Two-hundred and sixty-four symptomatic (63.46%) with >50% diameter stenosis and 152 (36.54%) asymptomatic patients with >70% diameter stenosis were included. The Mo.Ma Proximal Flow Blockage Embolic Protection System was used to perform protected CAS, achieving cerebral protection by endovascular clamping of the common carotid artery (CCA) and of the external carotid artery (ECA). RESULTS: Technical success, defined as the ability to establish protection with the Mo.Ma device and to deploy the stent, was achieved in 412 cases (99.03%). The mean duration of flow blockage was 4.91+/-1.1 min. Transient intolerances to flow blockage were observed in 24 patients (5.76%), but in all cases the procedure was successfully completed. No peri-procedural strokes and deaths were observed. Complications during hospitalization included 16 minor strokes (3.84%), 3 transient ischemic attacks (0.72%), 2 deaths (0.48%) and 1 major stroke (0.24%). This resulted in a cumulative rate at discharge of 4.56% all strokes and deaths, and of 0.72% major strokes and deaths. All the patients underwent thirty-day follow-up. At thirty-day follow-up, there were no deaths and no minor and major strokes, confirming the overall cumulative 4.56% incidence of all strokes and deaths rate, and of 0.72% rate of major strokes and deaths at follow up. In 245 cases (58.89%) there was macroscopic evidence of debris after filtration of the aspirated blood. CONCLUSIONS: This Italian multicenter registry confirms and further supports the efficacy and applicability of the endovascular clamping concept with proximal flow blockage in a broad patient series. Results match favorably with current available studies on carotid stenting with cerebral protection.
