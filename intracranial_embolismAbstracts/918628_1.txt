Between 1968 and 1977 5000 angiocardiographies revealed an aneurysm of the membranous septum (AMS) in 20 patients. In 11 patients the AMS was accompanied by a usually minor ventricular septal defect, in 4 by aortic valve disease, in 3 by coronary heart disease and in the remainder by some other rare heart disease. The diagnosis of AMS was established by angiocardiography, but in 3 patients it was detected by echocardiography. In one case a sepsis lenta with cerebral embolization was observed.
