The efficacy of treatment of cerebrovascular disorders is difficult to establish. Treatment effects may be confounded by the natural course of the disease, or they may be misjudged by bias and can not be compared with the results of treatments in other hospitals or with previous results. Pathophysiological knowledge does not always lead to the right or the most practical treatment, neither the results of in vitro or animal experiments, nor the experience with related disorders. The randomized clinical trial is the right method to investigate treatment effects, but is not faultless and explanatory experiments ought to be distinguished from pragmatic studies.
