We present a new technique, which is the distal perfusion first technique, for chronic dissection with dilatation of the aorta. Using a "side-ways-tau shaped" incision, this technique allows single-staged repair, full-time antegrade perfusion, less possibility of mesenteric malperfusion and cerebral embolism.
