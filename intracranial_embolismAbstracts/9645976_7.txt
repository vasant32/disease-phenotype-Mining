The type of small-vessel disease in small deep (lacunar) infarcts (SDIs) remains contentious as opposed to that in primary intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH), which is lipohyalinosis in most cases. Therefore, we compared risk factor profiles as indicators of underlying vessel pathology, between patients with SDI and patients with PICH, and those with a non-cardio-embolic infarct involving the cortex (CORTI). Multivariate regression analysis showed the diabetes mellitus [odds ratio (OR) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.90] and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.40-0.99) were more strongly associated with CORTI than with SDI. Carotid stenosis was associated with SDI in comparison with PICH (OR 7.5; 95% CI 1.02-54.94). Compared with PICH, CORTI was more strongly associated with diabetes mellitus (OR 3.27; 95% CI 1.38-7.76), carotid stenosis (OR 24.42; 95% CI 4.99-119.45), and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 3.12; 95% CI 1.47-6.65), whereas hypertension was associated with PICH (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18-0.79). These data support the hypothesis that small-vessel atheromatosis rather than small-vessel lipohyalinosis underlies lacunar infarcts in most cases.
