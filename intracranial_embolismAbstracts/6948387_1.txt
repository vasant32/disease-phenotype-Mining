The filterability of red cells was altered in 100 patients with CVA. This disorder appeared to be correlated with risk factors and haemostatic disturbances. The mechanism which links thrombosis with the filterability disorder, mainly depended upon a plasmatic factor. This factor disappeared after the red cells were carefully washed. The hypothesis of products originating from the thrombotic areas amd vasculo-endothelial lesions (mainly fibrin-related products) was supported.
