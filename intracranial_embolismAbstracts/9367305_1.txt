L-Asparaginase is the major induction-phase agent for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and an important adjuvant in treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, L-asparaginase-induced disturbances of clotting homeostasis may result in thrombosis or hemorrhage. Thrombotic occlusion of small cerebral veins has been reported in patients with ALL treated with this agent, but have not been described in NHL patients or those treated with the long-acting synthetic congener, pegaspargase. We report a 16-year-old boy with NHL who developed a focal motor seizure 15 min after receiving intravenous pegaspargase. MRI of the brain demonstrated multiple cortical and subcortical lesions that most likely represented focal brain edema due to thrombotic venous occlusion, which improved remarkably within 3 days and completely resolved within 3 weeks without specific intervention or permanent clinical consequences. This process must be considered when such changes are detected in NHL patients.
