The best management for patients requiring CABG with severe calcification of the thoracic aorta has not be established. To clamp ascending aorta in such cases produce cerebral embolization, aortic dissection or mural laceration. We reported a 60-year-old male for unstable angina with LMT lesion. Emergency CABG using IABP was performed with femoral cannulation, moderate hypothermia and induced ventricular fibrillation. His postoperative course was uneventful and coronary arteriography revealed a satisfactory patent graft of the RITA to the LAD system.
