The intact omentum of 13 monkeys was lengthened, placed subcutaneously, and laid on the left cerebral hemisphere prior to occluding the left middle cerebral artery. Two of these 13 monkeys developed left cerebral infarct and a right hemiparesis. Nine other monkeys had their left middle cerebral artery occluded without omental protection. All of these 9 developed a left cerebral infarct and 8 of them a right hemiparesis. Intact omentum may prevent a cerebral infarction when placed on the brain prior to MCA occlusion.
