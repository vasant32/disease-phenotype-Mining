Lipoprotein and hemostatic profiles including coagulation inhibitors were determined in 136 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Based on clinical examination, cerebral computed tomography, Doppler ultrasonography of precerebral arteries and transthoracic echocardiography, the strokes were classified as cardioembolic (n = 38), non-cardioembolic (n = 92), and mixed cardioembolic/hypertensive (n = 6). Patients with cardioembolic stroke were older than patients with non-cardioembolic stroke. Lipoprotein(a) was higher in the cardioembolic than in the non-cardioembolic group. Lipoprotein(a) was not significantly correlated to the other lipid levels and may represent an independent lipid risk factor. The non-cardioembolic group had higher levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B. The cardioembolic group had higher concentrations of fibrinogen and D-dimer, and lower levels of antithrombin, protein C, protein S and heparin cofactor 2 than the non-cardioembolic group. The differences in the hemostatic profile are consistent with thrombosis due to activated coagulation being more involved in the pathogenesis of cardioembolic than of non-cardioembolic stroke. Lipoprotein(a) seems to be more associated with coagulation markers of thrombosis than with atherosclerosis, whereas the other lipids mainly seem to be risk factors for atherosclerosis.
