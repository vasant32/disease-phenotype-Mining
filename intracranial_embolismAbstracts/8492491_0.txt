The best management of the calcified ascending aorta during coronary surgery has not established. Clamping of the calcified aorta causes cerebral embolism, aortic rupture and laceration as a lethal complication. Recently we had two successful cases of surgical treatment and these were treated by "Non-touch aortic technique". The femoral cannulation and ventricular fibrillation with moderate hypothermia or circulatory arrest will reduce the risk of coronary bypass surgery in the calcified aorta.
