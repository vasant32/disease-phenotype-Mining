In a 23-year-old woman CT demonstrated a patent giant intracranial aneurysm. MRI, CT and angiography one month later demonstrated complete spontaneous thrombosis of the aneurysm. The diagnosis was confirmed surgically and pathologically. This case demonstrates that a normal angiogram can be associated with a thrombosed giant aneurysm, and that this diagnosis should be considered in cases of angiographically-occult cerebral vascular malformations.
