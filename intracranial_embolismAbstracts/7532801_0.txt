A 27-year-old male presented with intracranial embolization due to accidental penetration of his neck by an iron fragment at work. Cerebral angiography revealed foreign body embolization of the left middle cerebral artery. The foreign body was successfully removed via craniotomy and arteriotomy. The extended period from onset to surgical treatment prevented acute hemodynamic reconstruction. However, he had good collateral circulation and was discharged with mild hemiparesis and moderate motor aphasia. The possibility of intracranial embolization should be considered in patients presenting with penetrating injury of the neck.
