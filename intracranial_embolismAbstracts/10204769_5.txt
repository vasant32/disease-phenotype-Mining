In clinical thromboembolic stroke, spontaneous late recanalization is a common feature, but one which has been very sparsely studied experimentally. This study aimed at enabling the study of spontaneous reperfusion and exploring its consequences by modifying a recently developed photothrombotic-stroke model that focuses on the region-at-risk located within an ischemic ring-locus. The exposed crania of male Wistar rats (280-340 g) were subjected to a ring-shaped (5.0 mm outer diameter and 0.35 mm thick) laser-irradiation beam (514.5 nm; 0.89 W/cm2) for 2 min simultaneously with intravenous erythrosin B (17 mg/kg) infusion for 30 s. Transcardial carbon-black perfusion experiments revealed a ring-shaped cortical perfusion deficit at 4 h post-irradiation, which progressively increased at 10, 24, and 48 h, at which time the whole region-at-risk was pale with single distal branches of the middle cerebral artery being extensively narrowed, but not occluded. At 72 h, spontaneous reperfusion was observed in the region-at risk, which was even more pronounced at 7 and 28 days. Cortical cerebral blood flow (cCBF), measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry, was distinctly reduced at 2 min post-irradiation and further decreased slightly during 4 h of recording to ca. 24% of baseline values at the ring locus and 40% in the region-at-risk. In the region-at-risk, cCBF flow values were 23-30% of the baseline at 2448 h post-irradiation, followed by a relative cCBF increase to 71 and 77% at 72 and 96 h post-irradiation. Brain water content in the ischemic part of the cortex increased steadily from 4 to 48 h post-irradiation; at 72 h, it leveled off and returned to control values at 7 days. In conclusion, by employing a laser beam in the shape of a thin ring, critically sustained cCBF reduction was followed by late, consistent spontaneous reperfusion in the region-at-risk in this novel photochemically induced stroke-in-evolution model.
