BACKGROUND/AIMS: The sigmoid colon is the most frequent site for a volvulus. In this report, we review our experience with sigmoid colon volvulus. METHODOLOGY: We present our experience of 81 cases of sigmoid volvulus admitted to our department. RESULTS: Preoperative endoscopic volvulus detortion was attempted in all patients, and in 39 of them the procedure was successful. The success rate of endoscopic detortion for sigmoid colon volvulus with a flexible colonoscope (60%) was higher than with a rigid rectosigmoidoscope (42%). In 19 of these 39 non-operatively devolvulated patients, sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis was performed within 7-10 days after reduction, but 20 patients did not accept the elective operation after a non-operative treatment. Among the 61 patients undergoing urgent or elective operation for sigmoid volvulus, there were 17 laparotomies with only detortion, 19 resections with elective anastomosis, 6 resections with primary anastomosis, and 19 resections with a Hartmann's pouch. There were 9 deaths (21%) among 42 patients who underwent an emergency operation, and one (5.2%) among the 19 patients who had elective surgery died because of a cerebral embolus. CONCLUSIONS: Initial therapy with endoscopy affords decompression and an adequate preparation of patients for surgical resection, and a flexible colonoscope has notable advantages over rigid instruments for the detortion process.
