Abnormal intracranial venous drainage called cerebral venous angioma is usually asymptomatic. Hemorrhages and seizures may however occur. The malformation may rarely be revealed by thrombosis. We report the case of a 25-year-old right-handed woman who developed cortical thrombophlebitis subsequent to developmental venous anomalies. After a course of anticoagulant therapy, outcome was good, demonstrating that anticoagulant therapy may be indicated in spite of the high risk of hemorrhage.
