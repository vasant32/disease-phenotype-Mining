A revival of interest in antithrombotic agents for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease has resulted in the widespread use of oral anticoagulants for the prophylaxis and therapy of the ischemic variety of stroke, and has generated enthusiasm for the use of platelet-suppressant agents such as aspirin, dipyridamole, and sulfinpyrazone. In delineating the several clinical types of focal ischemic disease and outlining the causes of cerebral ischemia and infarction, the study group considers the problems of data interpretation in the face of inconsistent terminology. The basic mechanisms of hemostasis and thrombogenesis are concisely detailed. Finally, the study group critically reviews extensive earlier reports of clinical trials of anticoagulants, platelet function suppressants, and thrombolytic agents, and reassesses according to present-day statistical standards the significance of the results. The information contained in this report should familiarize the reader with sufficient data to permit him to utilize antithrombotic agents under a variety of circumstances and to appreciate the contraindications and potential dangers in their use.
