In seven carotid-related acute hemispheric strokes with simultaneous embolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery thrombolysis with urocinase or rt-PA was performed preoperatively (n = 3) or intraoperatively (n = 4) after carotid endarterectomy. Four patients recovered totally, three patients showed a remarkable improvement and were able to walk postoperatively. The combination of carotid endarterectomy and thrombolysis (simultaneous or staged) is a new option in the emergency treatment of an acute carotid-related stroke and should be evaluated in prospective interdisciplinary studies.
