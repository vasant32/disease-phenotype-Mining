We describe a series of experiments in which a subhuman primate model was used to create temporary and permanent cerebral ischemia by three separate mechanisms. In the first group of five baboons, a hemodynamic model was produced by creating unilateral and bilateral carotid stenotic lesions of varying degrees with and without associated reduction in systemic perfusion pressure. Only global ischemic changes and no focal changes resulted. In the second group of three baboons, a macroembolic model was produced by introducing solid particulate material into the extracranial circulation. No reversible contralateral focal neurologic changes resulted. In the third group of 11 baboons, cerebral ischemia was produced by introducing agents known to cause platelet aggregation (arachidonic acid, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen) into the extracranial arterial circulation. Arachidonic acid caused seizures, adenosine diphosphate caused severe postural hypotension, and only collagen fibrils produced a picture resembling a transient ischemic attack. We propose a theory that intravascular activation of the prostaglandin cascade by chemical initiation may result in the pathophysiologic changes of transient cerebral ischemia.
