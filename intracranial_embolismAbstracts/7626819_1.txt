One hundred twenty-seven patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were monitored by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Five patients had more than 50% increases in middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity during the initial phase (10-120 sec) of cardiopulmonary bypass. Four of these 5 developed neurological complications including stroke and encephalopathy. These results indicate that overperfusion of the basal cerebral arteries during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures may contribute to neurological dysfunction after the surgery.
