We present a case of cerebral fat embolism (CFE) that demonstrated evidence of diffuse white matter cytotoxic edema on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, in addition to punctate hyperintensities on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. The case suggests that CFE represents a combination of occlusive arteriolar disease and secondary neurotoxicity.
