Thirteen patients with transient vertebrobasilar insufficiency caused by emboli from a proximal subclavian artery lesion were treated over a 5-year period. This group was characterized by the absence of significant carotid disease (12 of 13 patients) and equal arm pressures bilaterally in most patients (8 of 13 patients). An isolated supraclavicular bruit (12 of 13 patients) and a history of ipsilateral digital ischemia (5 of 13 patients) were common. Arch angiography demonstrated proximal subclavian lesions in 12 patients, with obvious ulcerations in 10 cases and thrombus in an old carotid-subclavian bypass graft in one case. Surgery directed at removal or exclusion of the lesion was successful in all cases. Isolated lesions in the subclavian artery can be a source of emboli into the vertebrobasilar circulation. These lesions are effectively treated by exclusion and vascular reconstruction.
