Peripheral neuropathy was not found even six to ten years after the onset of visual symptoms in a family with primary amyloidosis, except in the propositus at the terminal stage. The propositus had mainly ocular and CNS involvement. An ocular manifestation, the vitreous opacity, was the only involvement in the family members, in spite of the long clinical course. This family may have a different type of familial primary amyloidosis from that previously reported.
