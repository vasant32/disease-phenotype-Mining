Two cases of left atrial myxoma are reviewed, both presenting as embolic phenomena. Neither patient gave a history compatible with pre-existent cardiac dysfunction. Sudden collapse and subsequent right hemiplegia resulted in one patient when an embolus lodged in the left middle cerebral artery. The second patient presented with headache and transient visual obscuration in the left eye. She showed evidence of embolism to the central retinal artery, and particulate matter could be seen within the retinal arterioles. Attention is drown to the fact that echocardiography now constitutes a simple, noninvasive, and highly reliable method of making this diagnosis. The propensity for embolic tumor fragments to grow and invade cerebral arterial walls is discussed along with its possible neurosurgical significance.
