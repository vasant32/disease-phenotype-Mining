As part of an ongoing longitudinal study of coronary heart disease and stroke among Japanese men in Hawaii, 8,006 men of Japanese ancestry living on the island of Oahu and aged 45-68 at entry examination have been followed by reexamination and surveillance. One hundred and eleven were found to have evidence of prior stroke at the time of the initial examination. During a six-year follow up period of the remaining 7,895 men, 94 developed definite thromboembolic stroke, 33 definite intracranial hemorrhage, and 6 developed stroke of unknown type. The principal risk factors for thromboembolic stroke were: elevated blood pressure, glucose intolerance, age, and electrocardiography evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or strain. Attributes associated with increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage were elevated blood pressure, electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or strain, and alcohol intake. Serum cholesterol level was negatively associated with risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
