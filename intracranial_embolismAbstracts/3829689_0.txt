Two cases of successful surgical removal of left ventricular thrombi are presented. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed in the first case multiple masses of thrombi in the dilated ventricle consistent with congestive cardiomyopathy and emergency surgery was performed for cerebral embolism. In the second case the thrombus was pedunculated and calcified, a probable sequel of a 17-year old myocardial infarction. The pertinent literature of echocardiographic and surgical aspects of left ventricular thrombi is reviewed.
