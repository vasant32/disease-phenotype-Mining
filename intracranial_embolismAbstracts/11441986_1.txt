The factor V Leiden (FV Leiden) and prothrombin G20210A mutations, are the most common established genetic risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the relationship between these mutations and arterial thrombotic syndromes (coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke) has not been established. Some studies have suggested a relationship between them, but other authors have considered it unlikely that these anomalies are a major risk factor for arterial thrombosis. From the clinical point of view, a question arises concerning the risk of repeated thrombosis in patients carrying one of these two mutations. The question is whether the recurrence is attributable to the mutations or to the presence of additional circumstantial risk factors. As the risk of repeated thrombosis varies considerably from one patient to another, decisions about long-term treatment require weighing the persistence of risk factors for vascular disease (venous and arterial), especially in selected cases such as young patients or patients with thrombosis of unusual localization.
