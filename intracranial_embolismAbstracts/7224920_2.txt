Complications of carotid sinus pressure, which are rare, include cardiac arrhythmias and cerebrovascular accidents. A 79-year-old man experienced a flaccid right hemiplegia one minute after left carotid sinus pressure. At necropsy, an atheromatous embolus occluded the left middle cerebral artery, resulting in hemorrhagic infarction in its vascular territory. Atheromatous embolism following carotid sinus pressure has not been previously documented. Most sudden stroke deficits following carotid sinus pressure are probably caused by this mechanism.
