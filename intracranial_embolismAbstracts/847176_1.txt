The EMI head scanner was used to review a large number of cases of porencephaly; computed tomographic scanning was found to be the most satisfactory method of evaluating these lesions. The nuclide brain scan has not usually been of significant value for diagnosis, and although angiography and pneumoencephalography were used for correlation in some cases, the CT scan is often the only neuroradiological procedure necessary to achieve the correct diagnosis. Porencephalic areas usually have a well-defined border, have the density of cerebrospinal fluid, and do not change in density following the use of contrast medium enhancement.
