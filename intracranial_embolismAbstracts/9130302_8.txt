Photochemical induction of a thrombosis produces lesions of the cortex of reproducible area and depth, and it has been suggested that this may provide a relatively noninvasive model of the human condition of stroke. The cognitive effects of photothrombotic lesions centred at two different positions were assessed in rats using the Morris water maze test for spatial learning and memory, and it was demonstrated that profound deficits in acquisition of this task were produced by bilateral lesions of the frontal cortex. These effects were in the absence of overt motor deficits, and there was no significant correlation between lesion volume and functional deficits. Flunarizine (2 mg/kg) did not attenuate this ischaemic damage and had no effect on the functional deficits. This model has distinct advantages over more invasive global models of ischaemia and may also provide greater understanding of the functional role of the mammalian neocortex.
