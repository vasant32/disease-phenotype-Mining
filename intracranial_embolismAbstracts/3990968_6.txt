Three patients with CT and angiographic documentation of cerebellar infarction in the superior cerebellar artery distribution had ataxic gait with little or no vertigo. Limb ataxia occurred in two patients. Transient chorea and signs of pontine infarction were also noted. CT demonstrated infarcts on the upper surface of a cerebellar hemisphere and/or vermis. Angiograms disclosed occlusion of the top of the basilar artery in two cases and distal superior cerebellar artery (SCA) branches in one. One patient later died after distal basilar artery occlusion; the others recovered.
