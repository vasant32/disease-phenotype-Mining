In the present study, we compared Tc-99m HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain images obtained using the conventional filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction method with the new reconstruction method of conjugate gradients with modified matrix (CGMM). The two methods were employed to generate SPECT images of a brain perfusion study in a 41-year-old patient who had suffered from multiple embolisation of the right hemisphere. Marked improvement in spatial resolution was achieved by CGMM reconstruction as compared to FBP reconstruction; this considerably helped in defining grey matter structures and low-uptake white-matter areas, both in the normal cerebral areas and in the hemisphere that had been affected by stroke. Although the relatively long time still required by the CGMM procedure might be considered as a significant drawback to date, with the increasing diffusion of the new computer facilities the CGMM method can be proposed as a valuable alternative to the standard FBP technique in order to better recognise cerebral areas with different tracer uptake.
