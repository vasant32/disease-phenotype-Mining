Following endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, cerebral infarctions have been reported to involve an apoptotic process, including the activation of the caspase cascade. To confirm whether fragmented caspase-12, which is activated by cleavage and is detectable during ER stress, is also involved in embolic cerebral infarctions in rats, we adopted an autologous blood clot model for the analysis of cerebral infarctions. We performed experiments in rats with brain infarctions, which are closely related to embolic cerebral infarctions. We utilized a homologous blood clot, i.e., natural materials, to form the infarct area. Our findings reveal that caspase-12 is fragmented when infarct areas form in cerebral cortical neurons. Interestingly, we observed that these fragments translocated to the nuclei of not only cerebral cortical neurons but hippocampal neurons. We further found that glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a marker of ER stress, is up-regulated in both cerebral cortical and hippocampal neurons during cerebral infarction. This result suggests that the fragmentation of caspase-12 and the subsequent nuclear translocation of these fragments are involved in the brain infarction process in rats.
