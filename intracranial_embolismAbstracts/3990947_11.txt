The authors report their experience based upon 56 cases of CT in cerebral thrombophlebitis. Direct signs of occlusion of the veins are infrequent and interest lies in the abnormalities due to brain edema or venous infarct. It is fundamental to recognize these infarcts as their evolution is favorable under treatment. Angiography is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis which can be only suspected on CT findings.
