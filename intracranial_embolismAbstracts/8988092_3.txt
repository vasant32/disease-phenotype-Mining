Although complement activation is associated with tissue injury during inflammatory and ischemic states, complement activation in states of acute cerebral ischemia before and after administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has not yet been examined and is the focus of this investigation. Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3 to 3.5 kg were used for this study. Of these, 20 were subjected to intracranial autologous clot embolization via the internal carotid artery. Three hours postembolization, rabbits received an intravenous infusion of TPA (6.3 mg/kg, 20% bolus with the remainder infused over a 2-hour interval; 12 animals) or vehicle (eight animals). All animals were observed for a total of 7 or 8 hours postembolization. These two groups were compared to a cohort undergoing sham operation with subsequent TPA infusion (four animals). Plasma samples to quantify complement component C5 hemolytic activity (C5H5O) were obtained at the following time points: 30 minutes before and after clot embolization; 1 hour before and 1 hour after the initiation of therapy with TPA or vehicle and at the completion of the protocol; 7 to 8 hours after clot embolization. The C5 activation was not detected as the result of acute cerebral ischemia. However, animals receiving TPA with or without concomitant clot embolization exhibited C5 activation as assessed by a reduction in C5 hemolytic function, both 1 hour after initiation of TPA infusion (78.7 +/- 10.3% and 77.5 +/- 9.9% of baseline value, respectively; mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) and at the end of the protocol, 2 hours after the completion of the TPA infusion (72.5 +/- 8.8% and 53.3 +/- 8.1%, respectively; mean +/- SEM, p < 0.05, each group). This study supports the conclusion that TPA, but not acute cerebral ischemia, may activate the complement cascade in this rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke.
