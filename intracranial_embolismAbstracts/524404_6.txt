Brain edema was induced in rats by injecting 50 mu microspheres, labelled with 85Sr, into the internal carotid artery. The use of radioactive microspheres as embolic agents enabled the number of microspheres to be determined in each cerebral hemisphere. Edema was assessed 12 or 24 h after embolization by measuring brain water content and, in some experiments, sodium and potassium. Pretreatments with dexamethasone, parachlorophenylalanine (an inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis), mepyramine and metiamide (H1 and H2 histamine receptor antagonists) or aminophylline did not influence significantly the development of brain edema evaluated 24 h after embolization. Aminophylline treatment (100 mg/kg) markedly increased mortality following embolization. Gamma-butyrolactone (300 mg/kg, every 2 h) inhibited significantly the development of brain edema evaluated 12 hours after embolization. Increases in water and sodium in the embolized cerebral hemisphere were reduced by about 50%. This protective effect may be related to the known depressant action on brain metabolism.
