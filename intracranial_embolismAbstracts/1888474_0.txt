Nine white New Zealand rabbits were submitted to internal carotid embolization with microspheres which caused a histologically verified focal cerebral ischemia. Six animals were sham-operated. EEG, QEEG, ECG, blood pressure, rectal temperature and platelet aggregation were monitored in basal conditions and one hour after ischemia. Embolized animals showed an increase in power density spectrum (PDS) and delta activity (0.15-3.70 Hz) and the appearance of platelet aggregation. The QEEG changes were correlated to the degree of platelet aggregation after ischemia.
