Analysis of CT image in 112 patients with tuberculous meningitis, abnormal findings were shown in 80.4% cases. They were tuberculoma, hydrocephalus, basal cistern exudation, cerebral embolism, brain atrophy, miliary nodules, tuberculous abscesses and etc. Tuberculoma, hydrocephalus and basal cistern exudation are common changes in patients of cerebromeningitis type. Basal cistern exudation is the main image in early stage patients. Hydrocephalus occurred in patients of chronic stage. Manifold lesions occurred in late stage patients. The longer the disease course, the more is the abnormal finding rate by CT image. The prognosis of patients with normal CT image is good, the patients with manifold lesions are worse than those patients with single lesion by CT image, and sequelae developed more frequently in those patients with manifold lesions.
