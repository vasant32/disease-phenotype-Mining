Cerebral venous thrombosis is an infrequent cause of childhood stroke. It is reported most frequently in the setting of acute dehydration, cyanotic congenital heart disease, or the nephrotic syndrome and it is commonly found in patients with hereditary coagulation or immunologic disorders. Thrombotic tendencies may also occur in children with iron deficiency anemia. We describe a 11-months old boy with cerebral venous thrombosis likely attributable to dehydration and iron deficiency anemia by intestinal chronic blood loss, caused by food allergy.
