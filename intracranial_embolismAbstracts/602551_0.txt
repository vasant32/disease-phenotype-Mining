The authors analyse the significance of some factors for the development of a clinical, electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic picture of the secondary dysfunction of stem brain structures in patients suffering from strokes with a hemispheric localization of the focus. A great complexity and different influences of the course of stages of the secondary stem syndrome are stressed. Attention is drawn to the expedience of using repeated EEG recording in the acute phase of a stroke for diagnostic purposes.
