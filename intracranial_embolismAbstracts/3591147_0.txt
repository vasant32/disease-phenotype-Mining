Appraisal of the results of surgical treatment of 7 patients with arterial aneurysms of the carotid channel convinced the authors of the useful applicability of extra-intracranial anastomosis in occlusion of the cerebral arteries. The anastomosis provides for adequate compensation of circulation in the brain in occlusion of not only the internal carotid artery but also the middle cerebral artery. Depending on the surgical situation, extra-intracranial anastomosis can be performed both as a planned procedure and as an emergency measure. Emergency establishment of the anastomosis is useful in all cases of complications of the operations terminating in occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery.
