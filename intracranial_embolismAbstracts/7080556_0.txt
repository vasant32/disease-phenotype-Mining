The authors investigated the occurrence of mortality during hospitalisation (first 4 weeks) and in the following period (from the 5th week till the end of the first year) on 70 patients with acute myocardial infarction subject to temporary pacemaker therapy due to bradyarrhythmia and/or conduction disorders. Progression of conduction disorder has been commonly observed during hospitalisation, mortality amounted to 43 per cent. Almost each of the conduction disorders has been discontinued by means of prophylactic pacemaker therapy. Despite the successful pacemaker therapy during the acute phase one third of the patients died within one year. It was found by the authors that the mortality in both periods showed close relationship not with the character of the block, but with the localisation and the severity of the infarction.
