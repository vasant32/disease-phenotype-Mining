Five cases of neonatal cerebral venous thrombosis (NCVT) diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are presented in this report. MRI was specific for the anatomic diagnosis, demonstrating involvement of the superior sagittal sinus in 3 infants or deep venous system in the remaining 2. Four cases were associated with perinatal hypoxia or cranial trauma. Three of these children show significant developmental delays. The increased use of MRI may add significant information on the association of cerebral venous thrombosis with the common systemic illnesses of newborns.
