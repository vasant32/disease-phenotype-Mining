Although the association between PFO and cryptogenic stroke is well shown in young adults, the causality is still unclear. The pathogenetic mechanism of ischemic stroke related to PFO is not entirely understood. Indeed, besides the well-known paradoxical embolism, formations of thrombi in situ, especially in the presence of ASA, a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation have been often observed. Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis may be due to local inflammation or to acquired or genetic thrombophilia including hyperhomocysteinemia. We report a case of a young man presenting with a cerebellar infarction probably secondary to a paradoxical brain-to-brain embolism, in which the only detectable embolic source was a cerebral vein thrombosis.
