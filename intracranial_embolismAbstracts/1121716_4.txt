An uncommon type of stroke in children is presented. An intracranial arteriovenous malformation in a 13-year-old boy spontaneously occluded about 22 months after surgical intervention. Precipitating factors, such as bacterial infections, could not be demonstrated in this patient, who had been attending school since the time of the craniotomy. The histological features of venous encephalomalacia in the galenic territory are contrasted with hemorrhagic encephalomalacia as seen after arterial occlusions: in the former, hemorrhages are more widespread and edema is more pronounced.
