Cardiac involvement in patients with polymyositis is usually asymptomatic and associated with a mild clinical course. A female patient with muscle weakness and cardiogenic shock, who was diagnosed with polymyositis and fulminant myocarditis, is described. A large amount of methylprednisolone, in addition to intra-aortic balloon pumping and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support, led to the recovery of her cardiac function. However, a massive cerebral embolism occurred and she died. Postmortem histopathological examination showed necroses of muscles and diffuse invasion of mononuclear cells in both the myocardium and the biceps muscle of her arm. Although the mechanism of cardiac dysfunction is not clear, immunosuppressive therapy was effective for fulminant myocarditis in the present case.
