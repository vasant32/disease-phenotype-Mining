The present study was conducted in 17 patients of haemorrhagic stroke (HS), 19 patients of thrombotic stroke (TS) and 14 control subjects. In each subject platelet functions (spontaneous platelet aggregation (SPA), aggregation induced with 10, 5, 2.5 microM ADP and 10 micrograms/ml of collagen) and complete lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein [HDL], low density lipoprotein [LDL], very low density lipoprotein [VLDL] and LDL/HDL ratio) were performed within 7 days of onset of stroke. Platelet aggregation with 2.5 microM ADP was significantly lower (P < 0.05), in both the stroke groups in comparison to controls. No other changes were significant. Mean serum triglycerides and VLDL of TS group were significantly higher than that of controls. Mean LDL/HDL ratio of the same group was significantly lower than HS group. It can be concluded that alterations in platelet functions and lipid profile are induced by both types of strokes in acute stage.
