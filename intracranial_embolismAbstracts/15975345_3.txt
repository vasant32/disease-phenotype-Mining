BACKGROUND: Femoral artery cannulation and retrograde arterial perfusion have been postulated to increase the risk of cerebral embolism. In this study, the impact of the arterial cannulation site on the perioperative results after proximal aortic surgery is evaluated. METHODS: Between January 1996 and December 2002, a total of 327 patients underwent proximal aortic repair for chronic non-dissected aortic disease. The arterial inflow was established by cannulation of the aortic arch (group A) or the femoral artery (group F) in 166 and 161 patients, respectively. RESULTS: The early 30-day mortality was 0.9% (3 patients [1 patient in group A and 2 patients in group F]). The overall rate of early focal neurologic dysfunction (permanent and transient) was 4% (13 patients) and there was no significant difference between the two groups (4.2% vs 3.7%). Due to an intraoperative injury of the arterial wall, there were 6 repairs (3.6%) of the aortic arch in group A and 1 repair (0.6%) of the femoral artery in group F. The univariable examination of preoperative and intraoperative variables demonstrated that hypertension and increased cholesterol level could be possible independent risk factors for neurologic morbidity. In the following stepwise logistic regression, only the preoperative hypercholesterolemia was identified as an independent predictor for postoperative focal neurologic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The arterial inflow via the femoral artery and the subsequent retrograde perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass do not increase the risk of neurologic complications in patients who undergo proximal aortic repair due to chronic non-dissected aortic aneurysm. Because there is an increased risk of aortic wall injury during cannulation, the femoral artery seems to be more suitable in these cases for cannulation than the proximal aorta.
