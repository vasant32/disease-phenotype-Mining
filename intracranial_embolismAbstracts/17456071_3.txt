AIMS: The aim of our study was to evaluate the factors leading to embolization in patients with left atrial thrombi (LAT). With this purpose, we retrospectively analyzed clinical, transthoracic, transesophageal echocardiographic data of patients with LAT in the transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred ninety-two patients with LAT not on anticoagulant therapy were divided into two groups according to the presence of prior ischemic stroke. The group with ischemic stroke included more patients with sinus rhythm and less patients with mitral stenosis. They had smaller left atrial diameter, more left atrial appendage spontaneous echo-contrast, higher appendage ejection fraction, and emptying velocity. CONCLUSION: Once the thrombus has been formed, cerebral embolization seems to be higher in patients with relatively preserved appendage ejection fraction and emptying velocity. Presence of atrial appendage spontaneous echo-contrast also favor embolization. Factors leading to embolization seem to differ in some respects from the causes of thrombus formation.
