The incidence of complications in 2000 selective retrograde laevocardiograms is reported. Seventy-four complications were observed in 69 patients. None of these was fatal. On 39 occasions cardiac, and on three occasions cerebral complications were observed. In 20 patients there were complications at the site of puncture and in four patients sepsis or bacteraemia. Contrast sensitivity or allergy was found in eight patients. The relationship, described in the literature, between intramural contrast deposition and the type of catheter, ventricular size and ventricular wall was confirmed by our own observations, as well as the most frequent situation on the posterior wall of the left ventricle.
