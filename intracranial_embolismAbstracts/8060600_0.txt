This study aimed to investigate the effects of monosialoganglioside (GM1) when administered early in a model of cerebral focal ischemia, in the rabbit. The statistical evaluation of the electroencephalographic changes (quantified EEG analysis, QEEG) due to the ischemic event showed that the early treatment (1-3-24 h) with GM1 reduced the EEgraphic pattern typical of this model of cerebral ischemia. Considering the observation period, we hypothesized that it was due to the formation of an oedema of a lesser degree compared to the untreated group. Particularly, we did not obtain the increase in delta activity on the contralateral hemisphere, which we thought was expression of the diaschisi phenomenon.
