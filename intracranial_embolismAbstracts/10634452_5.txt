BACKGROUND: Studies of aortic arch plaques with transesophageal echocardiography have demonstrated that complex aortic arch plaques (CAPs) greater than or equal to 4 mm in thickness are associated with ischemic stroke. Recent studies have demonstrated that the morphological features of plaques may aid in the identification of aortic plaques that are more likely to be associated with embolic stroke. OBJECTIVE: To identify aortic plaques that are more likely to be associated with embolic stroke by means of their morphological features. METHODS: Transcutaneous B-mode ultrasonography was used to image aortic arch plaques in 500 consecutive patients. The criteria used to identify the morphological features of carotid artery plaques that are more likely to be associated with ischemic stroke (heterogeneous rather than homogeneous) were applied to aortic arch plaques. Statistical comparisons were made using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Ischemic symptoms (eg, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and amaurosis fugax) were present in 38% of 104 patients with CAP and in 34% of 391 patients without CAP. Nineteen (51%) of 37 patients with heterogeneous CAP were symptomatic. Twenty-one (31%) of 67 patients with homogeneous CAP were symptomatic (P = .04). CONCLUSION: Transcutaneous B-mode ultrasonography of the aortic arch can help to identify heterogeneous plaques that are more likely to be associated with ischemic stroke using morphological criteria derived from studies of carotid artery plaque.
