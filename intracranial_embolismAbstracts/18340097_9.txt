BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An animal model of selective middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion is needed for evaluation of intra-arterial (IA) delivery of thrombolytic agents. We describe a technique for MCA thrombo-occlusion in the rabbit with real-time angiographic documentation of occlusion and thrombolytic recanalization. METHODS: After femoral artery cutdown, a microcatheter was advanced from the internal carotid artery to the MCA. MCA occlusion was achieved by IA thrombin and reperfusion by IA plasmin. RESULTS: The terminal internal carotid artery was successfully catheterized in 12 of 13 animals. Stable (2-hour) MCA occlusion was induced and verified angiographically in all 12 animals; 2 animals also had distal internal carotid artery thrombus. Recanalization was achieved rapidly after IA plasmin in 3 of 3 animals. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new animal model of selective MCA occlusion documented by real-time angiography and used to demonstrate recanalization with IA plasmin.
