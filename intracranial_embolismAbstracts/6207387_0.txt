Peritoneovenous shunting for the treatment of malignant ascites has become increasingly popular. This technique can be complicated by tumor embolization, congestive heart failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Arterial thromboembolism has been encountered in two patients following LeVeen shunt insertion. Recurrent bilateral femoral artery thromboemboli and a cerebrovascular accident occurred in one patient and cerebrovascular thromboembolism developed in a second patient. Major arterial embolization is potentially a serious, although infrequent, complication of peritoneovenous shunting in patients who have malignant ascites.
