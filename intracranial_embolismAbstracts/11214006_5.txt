With older and sicker patients undergoing cardiac surgery, neurologic injury has emerged as an increasingly important cause of rising costs, morbidity and mortality. Several studies investigating the relationship between atherosclerotic aortic disease and subsequent adverse clinical outcomes have demonstrated that the single most important risk factor for neurologic injury following cardiac surgery is the presence of aortic atheromatous disease. The results of these studies suggest that atheroemboli are correlated with neurologic injury following cardiac surgery. Surgical techniques to avoid and prevent particulate debris during cardiac surgery may be a major step in preventing severe neurologic injury.
