 OBJECTIVE: : It is not known whether use of a clampless facilitating device during proximal graft anastamosis decreases intraoperative cerebral emboli in patients with mild atherosclerotic ascending aorta (AAA) having off-pump coronary artery bypass. METHODS: : After intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound showed no more than mild (grade I-II) atherosclerotic ascending aorta, 20 patients were randomized to receive either partial clamping (PC, n = 10) or the HEARTSTRING clampless device (HS, n = 9) for proximal graft construction on the ascending aorta. Continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring, with capability to discern gaseous from solid particulates, was used intraoperatively to monitor high-intensity transient signals (HITS) in the middle cerebral arteries. Postoperative diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging documented old and new ischemic brain lesions. RESULTS: : There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of proximals (P = 0.14), distals (P = 0.4), or intraoperative cell saver transfusions (P = 0.69). The total number of HITS was not significantly different between the PC and HS groups (P = 0.2). However, the number of solid HITS was significantly lower in the HS than in the PC group (2.7 ± 2.6 versus 14.0 ± 8.1; P < 0.001). The number of gaseous emboli in the HS group was fourfold greater when a mister-blower rather than a suction device was used to clear blood away from the HS site. Postoperatively, there were no deaths, myocardial infarctions, or clinical strokes observed in either group. Diffusion-weighted cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed no statistical difference between groups for new infarct lesions. CONCLUSIONS: : Use of the HS device during off-pump coronary artery bypass was associated with significantly fewer intraoperative solid emboli in the middle cerebral artery than PC of the ascending aorta.
