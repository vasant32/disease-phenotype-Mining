RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Individual components of the transverse magnetization decay curve (TDC) were assessed for their ability to characterize ischemia in photochemically induced cerebral infarcts. METHODS: Fifty rats were randomly divided into equal-sized experimental and control groups, which were subdivided into groups studied at five different time points, ranging from 6 hours to 22 days. All the rats received transcalvarial irradiation with 560-nm light. Five rats in each time group also received a sensitizing dye before irradiation. In these latter animals, lesions of uniform size and location developed. Lesions were compared with tissue of similar volume and location from the contralateral cortex of the experimental animals and with tissue from both hemispheres of the control animals. TDCs of all the samples were measured and fit with mono- and bi-exponential functions. RESULTS: Unlike the control tissue, infarcted tissue displayed definitive two-component TDC behavior. The time course of the bi-exponential parameters yielded information unavailable from mono-exponential analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Bi-exponential analysis of TDCs may have diagnostic use as a more sensitive indicator of cerebral infarction than mono-exponential analyses.
