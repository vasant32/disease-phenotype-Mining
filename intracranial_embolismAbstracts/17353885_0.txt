AIM: The clinical and prognostic profile of diabetic stroke patients is still an unclarified topic. The aim of the present study is to compare clinical features and risk factor profile in diabetics and in non-diabetics affected by acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We have included 98 diabetics and 102 matched non-diabetic subjects affected by acute ischemic stroke and matched by age (+/-3 years) and gender. We determined the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) on admission and the Rankin disability scale on discharge and after a 6 months follow-up. Ischemic stroke has been classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification. We anamnestically evaluated the presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, any records of transient ischemic attack, and stroke. Using conditional logistic regression analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Diabetes was associated with lacunar ischemic stroke subtype (OR 3.89, 95% CI 2.23-6.8), with a record of hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.48-4.32), and with a better SSS score at admission (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.96). The association of diabetes with lacunar stroke remained significant also after adjustment for hypertension (adjusted OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.9-5.99) or for large artery atherosclerotic and cardioembolic stroke subtypes (adjusted OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.08-6.69). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows some significant differences in acute ischemic stroke among diabetics in comparison with non-diabetics (higher frequency of hypertension, higher prevalence of lacunar stroke subtype, lower neurological deficit at admission in diabetics).
