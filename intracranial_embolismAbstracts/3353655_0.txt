The development of new catheter materials and techniques has made it possible to perform local intraarterial fibrinolysis in the region of the basilar artery in case of thrombotic arterial occlusions. We present the case of a 27-year old patient suffering from thrombosis of the basilar artery in whom local fibrinolysis was performed. The clinical course is demonstrated in respect to imaging methods (angiography, CT and MRT) and electrophysiological monitoring.
