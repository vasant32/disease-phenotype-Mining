The pathogenesis of brain infarctions, intracerebral hematomas and subarachnoidal hemorrhages is described. It is believed that defects in microcirculation are important factors in the development of brain infarctions, whereas hypertension and microaneurysms or vascular malformations are sources of intracerebral hematomas and subarachnoidal hemorrhages. Detection and differential diagnosis are presented from clinical aspects. Possibilities and limits of laboratory methods, especially CCT, are emphasized.
