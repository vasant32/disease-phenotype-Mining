We describe the case of a young man who, while he was in coma because of a traffic accident, had first a pulmonary embolus and immediately afterwards had a systemic (cerebral) embolus. A transesophageal echocardiographic image revealed a giant thrombi trapped in foramen ovale protruding in right and left ventricles, diagnosing, thus, a paradoxical embolism. The relationship between patent foramen ovale and pulmonary embolism has been reported in some series. Elevated right-chamber pressure caused by pulmonary hypertension could favor the establishment of a right-to-left shunt, causing, in some cases, paradoxical embolisms. We review the clinical implications.
