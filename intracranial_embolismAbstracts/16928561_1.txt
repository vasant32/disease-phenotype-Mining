We report a case of cerebral arterial air embolism that was followed by a brain computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging during the first week after onset. A 73-year-old man was admitted for treatment of pleural dissemination that was a recurrence after right lower bilectomy for advanced lung cancer. Thirty minutes after an anti-drug administration through the chest drainage tube, he lost consciousness shortly after coughing. A bubble in the inferior sagittal sinus was observed on the day of the stroke, which then disappeared within 24 hours. It seems that the anti-cancer agent evoked inflammation at the visceral pleura and the subject inhaled massive air flow into the systemic circulation.
