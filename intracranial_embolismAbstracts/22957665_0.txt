A 24-year-old previously healthy man presented with aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis during a workout session. Echocardiography for evaluation of the embolic source revealed multiple large masses in the right and left atria, right ventricle, left ventricular apex, and outflow tract and entrance of the superior vena cava. Surprisingly, the patient had been asymptomatic prior to his current presentation with cerebral embolism. He underwent urgent surgery and six cardiac tumors were resected. Pathologic examination of the lesions was compatible with myxoma. At a follow-up 10Â months later, the patient was noted to have some neurologic sequelae. No cardiac masses were reported on repeat echocardiography. The present case is unique for simultaneous occurrence of multiple myxomas in all cardiac chambers.
