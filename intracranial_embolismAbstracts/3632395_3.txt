Embolic stroke was induced in rabbits using autologous blood clot. One hour after stroke, animals received heparin anticoagulation (AC) for five hours (acute AC) or five days (chronic AC). Animals received excessive AC (partial thromboplastin time greater than 3.0 times control), adequate AC (partial thromboplastin time, 1.2 to 2.5 times control), or saline. After the animals were killed, the brains were examined for macroscopic evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. There was no significant increase over control in the incidence or severity of hemorrhage in any of the four treatment groups. The data suggest that heparin AC does not promote intracerebral hemorrhage after experimental embolic stroke.
