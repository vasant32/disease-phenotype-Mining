Fat overload syndrome is a rare complication of intravenous fat emulsion therapy. It is characterized by sudden elevation of the serum triglyceride level, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, coagulopathy, and variable end-organ dysfunction. The illness is generally discrete, and symptoms regress as the lipemia clears. The transient nature of the syndrome has allowed only speculation as to its pathogenesis. The authors report an autopsy study of a child who died during an acute episode of fat overload and document the causative role of fat sludging in the associated end-organ failure. In addition, they offer evidence that the coagulopathy, previously an enigma, results from primary fibrinolysis, possibly caused by release of tissue plasminogen activators from the damaged endothelial cells.
