The Jarvik-7 total artificial heart (TAH) has now been implanted in seven patients, with four (57%) suffering cerebral embolic events. Functional recovery in two patients was impaired by subsequent intracranial hemorrhage from anticoagulant therapy. The findings of a Jarvik-7 TAH explanted following a cerebral embolus are reported here. Thrombotic deposition was seen in the inner crevice formed between the two components of the aortic quick connector. In addition, deposition was seen around all four valves in the crevice formed between the valve ring and the plastic valve housing. On the atrioventricular valves, the deposition in this crevice was most severe on the outflow surface adjacent to the minor flow orifice. On the pulmonic valve, deposition was seen around the entire circumference of both the inflow and the outflow crevices. No thrombi were seen on the diaphragm, the diaphragm-housing junction, or the housing of the left ventricle. Hypercoagulability of the patient's blood gradually developed during implant, reaching a maximum on the evening before the clinical embolus. Increasing resistance to heparin was also demonstrated by in vitro testing.
