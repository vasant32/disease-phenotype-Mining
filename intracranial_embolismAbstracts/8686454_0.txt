The effects of percutaneous transluminal recanalization (PTR) on critical hemodynamics of cerebral embolism were studied using stable xenon-enhanced computed tomography in patients within 6 hours after onset. PTR was conducted in 10 cases (PTR group) and not conducted 8 cases (non-PTR group). The development of infarction was followed by CT scan. In the cortical arterial regions, the lowest cerebral blood flow (CBF) value in regions of interests (ROIs) without development of infarction was 12.9 ml/100 g/min in the PTR group and 17.0 ml/100 g/min in the non-PTR group. In ROIs with a cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CRC) less than 0 ml/100 g/min, even with a CBF greater than 12.9 ml/100 g/min, 3 of 4 ROIs underwent cerebral infarction. PTR conducted within 6 hours after onset of cerebral embolism would prevent the cortical regions with a CBF greater than 12.9 ml/100 g/min and with a CRC greater than 0 ml/100 g/min from undergoing cerebral infarction.
