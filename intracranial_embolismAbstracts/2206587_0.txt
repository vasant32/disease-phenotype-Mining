A prospective study was performed in 106 patients with acute stroke. The main purpose was the cardiac evaluation in the different types of cerebrovascular disease: Intracerebral hemorrhage (H), Cortical ischaemic events (C) and Subcortical ischaemic events (SC) and also to evaluate the interest of echocardiography in detecting occult cardiac sources of emboli. The study population included 54 men and 52 women with a mean age of 66.8 +/- 10.3 years. A thorough neurologic and cardiologic study with a computed tomography of the brain (TAC) and an echocardiogram (ECO) were performed in all patients. It was found 24 (23%) of H, 40 (38%) of C and 32 (30%) of SC. In the past history, heart diseases were more prevalent in C (p less than 0.04); previous stroke and systemic hypertension (HTA) were less prevalent in H (p less than 0.008) and in C (p less than 0.004), respectively. Atrial fibrillation (FA) was more frequent in ischaemic stroke (p less than 0.02) and within these in C (p less than 0.005). No more clinical and functional cardiac features or echocardiographic aspects had any difference in their prevalence in different types of stroke. Without clinical heart disease there were 19 (18%) cases but only in 10 were found in their echocardiograms a potentially embolic heart disease (PEHD) but 8 of them had questionable pathologic significance. In conclusion: C had more heart disease in their past history; FA is more frequent in C; it is difficult to diagnose a cerebral embolism with only a coexistent C and CPE, but if there is FA or a past history of heart disease in a C, the diagnosis of cerebral embolism is more probable; finally, echocardiography is of limited value to diagnose a PEHD in the elderly, however it makes possible to better evaluate most cardiac situations.
