A 24-year-old man with left sixth through twelfth cranial nerve palsies and severe, fluctuating, systemic arterial hypertension was found to have a large, vascular, catecholamine-forming glomus jugulare chemodectoma. After his electrolyte imbalance was corrected, left external carotid embolization (using Gelfoam) was carried out. The systemic blood pressure stabilized at around 160/100 mm Hg over the next 12 hours. Ten hours later the hitherto conscious patient developed acute arterial hypotension, lapsed into coma, and died. Autopsy showed tumor infarction, swelling, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, and medullary compression. An unusual complication of glomus tumor embolization is highlighted. The roles of preliminary decompressive surgery and urgent resuscitation by vasopressors are discussed.
