A series of 63 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) operated on during an eight-year period is presented. Indications for surgery and the timing of operation are discussed. Monitoring of epidural pressure was of help in assessing the intracranial pressure state, which is important in patient management in the acute stage, in timing of surgery, and in postoperative supervision. The operative mortality was one patient (1.6%). Two patients died due to incomplete resection and late rebleeding two years after operation. Among the others the overall result of surgery was good with respect to neurological deficit and working capacity.
