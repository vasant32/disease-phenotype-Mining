PURPOSE: To report a technique for emergency CAS of a stenotic internal carotid artery (ICA) lesion with an intraluminal thrombus, which predisposes to distal thromboembolism and could aggravate pre-existing neurological symptoms. CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old man with fluctuating stroke underwent successful emergency CAS for an ICA stenosis with intraluminal thrombus using a tandem balloon protection technique featuring proximal balloon blockade and a PercuSurge GuardWire system for distal protection. CONCLUSION: This experience suggests that emergency CAS with tandem balloon protection is a potential treatment for a stenotic lesion with an intraluminal thrombus in patients with fluctuating stroke.
