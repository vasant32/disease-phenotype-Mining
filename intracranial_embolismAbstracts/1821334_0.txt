The malondialdehyde generation by platelets and TXB2 in poor platelet plasma were examined in 36 patients with stroke during acute stage. By CT examination 19 cases were diagnosed hemorrhagic, 17 cases ischemic; while by syndrome differentiation of TCM 16 cases belonged to Zhongzangfu(middle internal organs), 20 cases Zhongjingluo (middle channels). Results showed that the malondialdehyde generation by platelets was reduced, TXB2 in poor platelet plasma increased in patients, compared with those in the healthy controls. This finding was common in stroke during acute stage and was not related to diagnostic classes by either CT examination or syndrome differentiation of TCM. This study indicates that maintenance of normal platelet function may have significant implication in the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease.
