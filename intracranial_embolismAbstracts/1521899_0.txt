The Vienna heart uses a vacuum formed, pellethane pulsatile ventricle and is available in left ventricular assist (LVAD) and total artificial heart (TAH) configurations. This device was used as mechanical support of the failing heart in nine patients intended for heart transplantation. In two patients with cardiomyopathy an orthotopic TAH was implanted; one survived despite severe preoperative ischemic liver damage, and the other died of sepsis. In seven patients an atrio-aortic LVAD was implanted; six had suffered an acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock, and one could not be weaned off bypass. Three patients survived. These included one 65-year-old with incipient ARDS at operation, and a 40-year-old with preoperative liver and kidney insufficiency who was transplanted in septicemia. In this patient the septic focus, natural and artificial heart, were removed at transplantation. Four patients died. In one we were unable to establish satisfactory circulation, one died after failure of the transplanted heart, one suffered a lethal cerebral embolism and one developed multi-organ failure after repeated attacks of ventricular fibrillation. With the Vienna heart sufficient circulatory support could be established with cardiac outputs between 6 and 8 l/min for the TAH and 3.5 to 4.5 l/min for the LVAD. With this type of support an overall survival rate of 44% could be achieved. Mechanical hemolysis was not a clinical problem and no device failure occurred.
