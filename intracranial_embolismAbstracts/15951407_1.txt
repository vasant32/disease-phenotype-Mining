BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with a combination of atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) have a substantially higher rate of recurrent ischemic events as compared to PFO alone. One possible explanation is a greater degree of right-to-left shunting with the combination. METHODS: Retrospective study using contrast transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (c-TCD) to study the degree of shunting in 46 patients with PFO with either transient ischemic attack or cryptogenic ischemic stroke. Eight patients with PFO+ASA identified on transesophageal echocardiogram were compared to 38 patients with PFO but without ASA. RESULTS: The number of embolic counts was no different with or without an ASA. Valsalva maneuver increased number of emboli, especially in patients with large PFOs. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ASA in addition to PFO do not appear to have an increased risk of right-to-left shunting as measured by c-TCD as compared to PFO alone.
