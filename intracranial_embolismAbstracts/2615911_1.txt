The neuropathological findings in a young man with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome presenting with complex partial seizures and transient ischaemic attacks are described. Whilst some of his symptoms could be attributed to large vessel thrombosis, the dominant pathological process was widespread small cerebral arterial thrombosis causing extensive microinfarcts within the cerebral cortex. These findings help to explain the neurological manifestations of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
