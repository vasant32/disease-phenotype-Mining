This paper decribes the results of the CT teams of the University Clinics Berlin, Mainz and Munich. 1658 patients with cerebral tumors have been examined so far (EMI Scanner Mark I, Matrix 160/160) revealing a diagnostic accuracy of 98.4%. The findings of various kinds of tumors (306 glioblastomas, 255 astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, 248 meningiomas, 212 metastases, 200 pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngeomas) are discussed and illustrated by typical images. Differential diagnostic problems and the importance of additional neuroradiological procedures are discussed.
