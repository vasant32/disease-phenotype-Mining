Cerebral emboli and abscesses are common complications in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease and right-to-left shunt. Of those, a persistent left superior vena cava (LSVC) draining into the left atrium, directly or through an unroofed coronary sinus, is a rather rare finding. In order to prevent recurrent cerebral emboli and abscesses, correction of this anomaly may be recommended. We report the first case of a patient who underwent a percutaneous closure of a persistent LSVC draining into the left atrium with an Amplatzer ASD occluder.
