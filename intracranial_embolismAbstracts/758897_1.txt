During a two-year period, a 15-year-old boy had three major manifestations of rheumatic fever, ie, chorea, rash, and carditis. Following the acute carditis, peripheral retinal neovascularization appeared in the left eye. Associated transient hemiparesis suggests that emboli may account for the retinal vascular occlusion. Rheumatic fever should be considered in the medical survey of patients who have retinal new vessels of obscure origin.
