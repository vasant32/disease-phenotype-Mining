We presented a patient of paradoxical embolism with Chiari network, subsequently being accompanied by probable incomplete infarction. This 21-year-old man suffered from consciousness disorder, aphasia and right hemiparesis, and hospitalized in November 6, 1999. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mixed intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images in part of the areas of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Cerebral angiography revealed the early venous fillings and the capillary blushs. These findings implicated stroke in young adult. Still more transcranial color-flow imaging showed high intensity transient signals with "Chirp" sounds on the left middle cerebral artery. Transesophageal echocardiography detected Chiari network. Chiari network was thought the course of cerebral infarction. Over again 123I-IMP single-photon emission CT findings revealed the marked reduction of his cerebral blood flow comprehensively in the left hemispherium. It was suggested that the recanalization after the paradoxical cerebral embolism had caused incomplete infarction.
