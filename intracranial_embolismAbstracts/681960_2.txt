We describe a fatal case of intracranial venous thrombosis occurring in early pregnancy. Such thrombosis usually occurs in late pregnancy or the puerperium but rarely during the first trimester of pregnancy. Computerized axial tomography suggested massive cerebral venous infarction. Necropsy findings showed not only cerebral venous thrombosis but also extensive pelvic and iliac vein thromboses. The relationship of cerebral venous thrombosis and pregnancy is discussed and the literature reviewed.
