A history of systolic (greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg) or diastolic (greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg) hypertension, diabetes mellitus (fasting venous plasma glucose greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl), a history of cigarette smoking, fasting serum total cholesterol greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl and greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl, and obesity (greater than or equal to 20% above ideal body weight) were examined as risk factors for atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI) in 144 men, mean age 81 +/- 8 years, and 391 women, mean age 82 +/- 8 years, in a long-term health care facility. ABI occurred in 33 of 144 men (23%) and in 68 of 391 women (17%), P not significant. A history of systolic or diastolic hypertension correlated with ABI in both men and women (P less than 0.001). Diabetes mellitus correlated with ABI in both men and women (P less than 0.001). A history of cigarette smoking correlated with ABI in men (P less than 0.02) but not in women. Serum total cholesterol greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl and greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl did not significantly correlate with ABI in men or in women. Obesity did not significantly correlate with ABI in men or in women. Systolic or diastolic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking are risk factors for ABI in elderly men. Systolic or diastolic hypertension and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for ABI in elderly women.
