This study was designed to consider the feasibility and effectiveness of combined body weight support (BWS) treadmill and overground training for a 71-year-old woman 19 months post left embolic middle cerebral artery stroke. The study used a modified single subject withdrawal design (ABAA). Initial baseline performance (A1) was established using a set of functional assessment tools for balance, mobility and gait. Intervention (B) was introduced and removed, and a second baseline performance (A2) was recorded. After a one-month delay, final baseline performance was established. During intervention, the participant was involved in combined BWS training three times/week for eight weeks. Single subject analyses and pre/posttest analyses were conducted. Results revealed that 17 of 20 indicators (85%) nine indicators (89%) performance one-month post intervention. Combined BWS training was feasible and effective in improving and maintaining functional performance in this participant.
