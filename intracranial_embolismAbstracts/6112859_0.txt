The article reports on 5 patients with polytrauma or who had undergone major surgery of the long bones. In all 5 patients there was acute respiratory insufficiency, and, in addition, a comatose condition lasting for a shorter or greater length of time. In 4 out of these 5 patients, tachypnea occurred despite normalisation of the pO2. Petechial hemorrhages occurred in 3 patients at the trunk. All patients rapidly overcame the acute respiratory insufficiency; no pulmonary shock syndrome developed. In case of acute respiratory insufficiency, especially if associated with comatose conditions, central fatty embolism should always be considered a differential diagnostic possibility.
