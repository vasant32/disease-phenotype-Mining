Starting from the observation of a post-traumatic thrombosis in the cervical portion of the carotid artery, with two subsequent similar findings, it is shown that angiography is of special importance in assessing these cases. Investigation of the cervical region of this artery should be considered in all cases of skull and cerebral trauma. On the other hand, the cases described by Sullivan show that the presence of a carotid lesion must be considered in all multiple injuries, just as injuries to vessels and organs must be excluded in patients with intracranial haematomas. Consultation between physician and radiologist is necessary for all injured patients in order not to omit any important steps during angiography.
