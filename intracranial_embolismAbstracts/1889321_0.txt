Eighteen patients with cerebrovascular disorder were observed comparatively using 133Xe rCBF measurement and microcirculation test of bulbar conjunctiva before and after treatment with 654-2. Remarkable decreasing of blood flow in the brain and improving of bulbar conjunctiva microcirculation were found after treatment. We consider that the same drug caused the different change of blood flow in and out brain may due to the reaction of micrangium tissue construction, nerve regulation and different organ's micrangium to Ach. We recommend 133Xe as a objective measurement to estimate brain blood flow. The value of treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disorder by 654-2 and raising microcirculation test as a objective measurement remains to discussed.
