OBJECTIVES: This study attempted to determine whether a subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse and no mitral regurgitation at rest will develop mitral regurgitation during exercise and have a higher than anticipated risk of morbid cardiovascular events. BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation in patients with mitral valve prolapse identifies a subset of patients at higher risk for morbid events. However, mitral regurgitation in patients with mitral valve prolapse may be intermittent and could go unrecognized. A provocative test to unmask mitral regurgitation in these patients would be useful. METHODS: Ninety-four adult patients with mitral valve prolapse and no mitral regurgitation at rest were studied during supine bicycle ergometry using color flow Doppler echocardiography in the apical four-chamber and long-axis views. Patients were prospectively followed up for morbid events. RESULTS: Thirty (32%) of 94 patients had exercise-induced mitral regurgitation. Prospective follow-up (mean 38 months) showed more morbid events in the group with than without mitral regurgitation and included, respectively, syncope (43% vs. 5%, p < 0.0001), congestive heart failure (17% vs. 0%, p < 0.005) and progressive mitral regurgitation requiring mitral valve replacement surgery (10% vs. 0%, p < 0.05). Cerebral embolic events, endocarditis or sudden death were rare and not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mitral valve prolapse without mitral regurgitation at rest, exercise provokes mitral regurgitation in 32% of patients and predicts a higher risk for morbid events.
