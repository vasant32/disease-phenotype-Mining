Ten patients with angiographically occult or thrombosed cerebrovascular malformations were analyzed. Seven patients initially presented with an episode of intracranial hemorrhage; three others presented with a seizure disorder. CT showed hyperdense (9) or isodense (1) lesion; the hyperdense portion was proven to be hematoma in 3. Enhancement was seen in 6 cases and was absent in 4. Angiography showed either avascular mass (7) or was normal (3). In 2 cases, angiographic studies showed non-visualization of abnormal vessels on repeat study. In a review of 200 cases of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, nine young patients had CT evidence of an acute hematoma but no angiographic or pathological evidence of abnormal vessels; and it was postulated that these represented cryptic vascular malformations or aneurysms. The clinical prognosis for both the angiographically occult (thrombosed) or cryptic cerebrovascular malformations was better than reported in previous studies.
