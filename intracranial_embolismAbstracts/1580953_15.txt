Twenty-five patients (10 neonates, 15 children) with cerebral venous thromboses diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography over a 10-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Two groups were analyzed separately because of their differing modes of presentation and outcome. Eighty percent of neonates presented with seizures and the outcomes were unfavorable in more than 50%. Thrombosis usually was associated with an acute systemic illness, such as shock or dehydration. In comparison, headache was the most common mode of presentation in the older children (excluding infants) and their outcomes generally were favorable. Thrombosis in this group usually occurred in the setting of a hypercoagulable state or an infectious process. In both groups, global or focal neurologic findings on initial examination unrelated to increased intracranial pressure correlated with the presence of an infarction on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Infants and children with infarction due to a deep venous thrombosis often had persistent neurologic disability at subsequent examination. No sequelae were observed in those children and neonates only with thrombosis or with superficial venous infarction. Treatment for both groups was conservative. No patient was anticoagulated specifically for the thrombosis. The good outcomes in most patients suggest that acute anticoagulation may not be indicated.
