Embolization of metallic missiles into the cerebral circulation is a rare occurrence. Most of the cases reported were due to gunshot wounds and shotgun wounds to the neck and face. Embolization from injuries sustained to the chest are extremely rare. We report a case of delayed pellet embolization to the middle cerebral artery resulting from a shotgun injury to the left chest.
