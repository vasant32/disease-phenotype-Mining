Seven neonates with arteriovenous malformation of the vein of Galen are described. Six presented with cyanotic heart failure. Two cases had antenatal cerebral infarction, five periventricular leukomalacia, and three recent haemorrhagic infarction. Cerebral damage due to the malformation suggests that surgical correction of the arteriovenous malformation offers little to neonates, though after the neonatal period individuals can be cured by operation.
