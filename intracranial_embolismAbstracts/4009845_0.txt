The use of shunts during carotid surgery may decrease the risk of perioperative stroke by allowing continued perfusion during the procedure. However, there are risks inherent with shunt usage that occur mainly during insertion. A brief clinical study illustrates the risk of shunt-induced emboli and a technique is described for safer shunt insertion.
