A cerebral metabolic activator was administered to patients with cerebrovascular dementia to treat urinary incontinence or pollakisuria. The results are of interest as discussed in this paper. This study was carried out on 35 patients (15 males and 20 females) with cerebrovascular dementia with the chief complaint of incontinence or pollakisuria averaging in age 78.1 years with a range of 65 to 92. The underlying disease was cerebral hemorrhage in 4 cases, cerebral embolism in 21 cases and sequelae of cerebral apoplexy in 10 cases. ADL was assessed in all cases by cerebral CT or MRI and Hasegawa's test, a simple test for dementia. Bladder function was evaluated by determining urodynamic tests (CMG, UFM, UPP) before and after medical treatment. Test drug was bifemelane hydrochloride, a cerebrovascular metabolic activator. It was administered at a dose of 150 mg/day for periods of 2 months or more. As a result, bladder symptoms improved in 16/35 patients (45.7%), and mental symptoms in 21/35 (60%). Urine voiding and holding as bladder functions determined by urodynamics tests were not affected at all. The effect of this drug on bladder symptoms is secondary to improvement of mental symptoms, and its most pronounced clinical effect was on dementia.
