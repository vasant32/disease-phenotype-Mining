1) In 113 patients with cerebral infarction, the cause of infarction was cardiac embolism in 35, atherosclerotic thromboembolism in 45. It was either cardiac embolism or atherosclerosis but undetermined in 30. 2) Seven risk factors have been analysed. Eight patients (7 p.cent) had none of these factors. In the 105 remaining patients risk factors were: a) atrial fibrillation in 36, diagnosed in 21. Efficient treatment was applied in 1 or perhaps in 2 patients; b) High blood pressure in 39, diagnosed in 32, efficiently treated in 5; c) dyslipidemia in 42, diagnosed in 9, efficiently treated in 3; d) obesity in 50, efficiently tackled in 2; e) diabetes in 24, diagnosed in 11, efficiently treated in 2; f) hyperuricemia in 28, diagnosed in 1 with no efficient treatment; g) smoking in 44, abandonned by 1 only. 3) The high frequency of cardiac embolism is briefly commented. 4) Non diagnosis or unefficient treatment was present in a high proportion of cases. Realizing this regrettable state of affairs should result in better preventive diagnosis and treatment which, is assumed, could significantly reduce cerebral infarction.
