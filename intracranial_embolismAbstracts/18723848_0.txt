We report a case of an ischaemic stroke secondary to an isolated pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. In this case, transoesophageal echocardiogram played a pivotal role in shunt identification, exclusion of atrial septal defect, and definitive diagnosis and localization of the pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations should be excluded in all patients with cryptogenic stroke.
