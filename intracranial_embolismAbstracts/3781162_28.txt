We report 2 cases of cerebral stroke in cirrhotic patients following endoscopic obturation of esophageal varices with Isobutyl-2-Cyanoacrylate. In both cases, hemiplegia appeared several hours after the procedure. A brain CT scan showed radiodense material in the cerebral arteries due to dissemination of Isobutyl-2-Cyanoacrylate. One patient died, the other improved slowly. Different hypotheses may be raised: defectuous injection into the arterial circulation, systemic emboli via portopulmonary venous shunts, delayed polymerization of Isobutyl-2-Cyanoacrylate. Systemic emboli have been reported previously following percutaneous transhepatic obliteration of esophageal varices, suggesting portopulmonary venous shunts. In spite of these 2 complications, this procedure remains useful in stopping acute variceal bleeding and in preventing recurrent bleeding.
