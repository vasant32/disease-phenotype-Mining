The frequency of cerebrovascular accidents and of risk factors including hypertension and diabetes was examined retrospectively in parents and siblings of 328 patients suffering from transient ischaemic attacks or non-embolic cerebral infarction and in a control group. The frequency of cerebrovascular accidents was significantly higher in the family of the patient compared to the family of the control. The relatives of the patient and the control had essentially the same frequency of diabetes, whereas hypertension was significantly more common in the family of the patient. When the relatives with one or both the risk factors were excluded and those with cerebrovascular accidents alone were compared, a greater frequency, though insignificant, was noted in the family of the patient. Hypertension and diabetes were more common in the relatives of the patient than in the control but this difference was not statistically significant. The significant excess of cerebrovascular accidents in the family of the patients suffering from transient ischaemic attacks and non embolic cerebral infarction cannot exclusively be attributed to the greater frequency of diabetes and hypertension.
