Effect of garlic on photochemically-induced platelet aggregation in pial microvessels of the mouse, in vivo, was compared to that of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA). Three trials were carried out, in which garlic at doses of 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg and ASA doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg were used. Each trial included treatment groups of male mice, approximately 30 g, and a control group. Animals were anesthetized (urethane, 1-2 mg/g, i.p.), the trachea was intubated and a craniotomy was performed. Induction of platelet aggregation was made by activation of circulating sodium fluorescein (0.1 ml of 5% solution/25 g, i.v.) with an intense mercury light. Garlic, ASA and vehicle solutions were injected, i.p., 60 min prior to the photochemical insult. The time for the first platelet aggregate to appear in pial arterioles was significantly delayed (P < 0.001) only by the 100 mg/kg garlic dose and by all ASA doses. The effect of this garlic dose on first aggregate was comparable to that of the 25 and 50 mg/kg ASA doses. Only the ASA doses delayed (P < 0.05) the appearance of first aggregate in venules. Arteriolar and venular diameter changes were not different among groups of all trials. Data of this study documented that garlic was capable of delaying platelet aggregation in mouse pial arterioles, in vivo.
