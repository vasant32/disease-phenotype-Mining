Traumatic thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery have been rarely reported and documented. Eight personal cases provide us an opportunity to stress the common features of this rare entity: onset of symptoms several hours after severe head-trauma, in young men; computerized tomography combined with carotid angiography are decisive for the diagnosis. Prognosis is poor-six deaths out of eight patients. Anticoagulantherapy is useless even dangerous. Extra-intra cranial anastomosis may appear a better solution in selected cases.
