The effect of chronic administration of variable low doses of Aspirin was studied on platelet adhesiveness, platelet count, bleeding time and clotting time to find out as to how low the dose of aspirin needs to be in order to have an effective antiplatelet effect in patients who require such therapy. A statistically significant reduction in the platelet adhesiveness was observed in all the groups, but the best effect was exhibited by 50 mgm of aspirin dose. Bleeding time was also increased in all the groups but statistically significant difference was observed with 50, 75 and 100 mgm doses. There was no change in platelet count and clotting time.
