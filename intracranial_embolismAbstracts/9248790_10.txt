OBJECTIVE: To describe the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) features of corpus callosum (CC) infarctions. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively 352 consecutive cranial CT and MR scans showing cerebral infarcts. Involvement of the CC was identified in 28 patients. RESULTS: Infarctions of the CC were diffuse (n = 3) or focal (n = 25). The former were seen in the setting of diffuse cerebral ischemia secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest or status epilepticus. The latter were divided into those affecting predominantly the genu, body or splenium. The most common location of the insult was the splenium (n = 13), followed by the body (n = 6) and genu (n = 3). In the remaining three patients combined genu/body infarctions were seen. CONCLUSION: Infarction of the CC may be more common than previously thought and is most often the result of cerebral embolism. MR is better suited than CT for the detection of vascular lesions of the CC.
