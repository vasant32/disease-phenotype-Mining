A girl with tuberous sclerosis and intracardiac masses had at least two episodes of cardiogenic cerebral embolization, the attacks characterized by acute onset of prolonged neurologic dysfunction arising from different vascular distributions in both cerebral hemispheres. Renal embolization was suggested by hematuria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated ischemic lesions in cerebral locations predicted by the clinical signs. MRI also demonstrated extensive areas compatible with the dysmyelination of tuberous sclerosis.
