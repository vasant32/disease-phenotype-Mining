Blood cysts within the heart are rare findings in adults. We describe a case of a woman with a history of orthotopic liver transplantation who presented for an echocardiogram to evaluate a potential source of cerebrovascular embolism. A cystic mass attached to the submitral valve apparatus was identified by transthoracic and confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography. Surgical exploration and pathologic examination confirmed the mass to be a blood cyst attached to the chordal apparatus of the posterior papillary muscle. This case report highlights the use of echocardiography in diagnosing intracardiac blood cysts.
