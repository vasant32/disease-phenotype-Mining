BACKGROUND: Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery reduces the intraoperative cerebral embolic load and may therefore cause less brain injury. The main aim of this study was to compare off-pump and on-pump surgery with regard to the frequency of new postoperative cerebral ischemic lesions and the prevalence of postoperative cognitive impairment. We also assessed whether preoperative cerebral ischemic injury predicts the risk for cognitive dysfunction after surgery. METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with ischemic coronary artery disease were prospectively randomized to undergo off-pump or on-pump surgery. A detailed neuropsychological assessment and a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging examination were performed on the day before and at 3 months postoperatively. The neuropsychological assessment was repeated at 12 months. RESULTS: There was no significant (p = 0.17) difference between off-pump (8.2%) and on-pump (17.3%) surgery with regard to new postoperative cerebral lesions. The prevalence of cognitive impairment after surgery was also similar in the two groups (3 months: off-pump 20.4%, on-pump 23.1%, p = 0.74; 12 months: off-pump 24.1%, on-pump 23.1%, p = 0.90). The degree of preoperative cerebral ischemic injury was significantly associated with cognitive dysfunction after on-pump (p = 0.02) but not after off-pump (p = 0.22) surgery. None of the patients with normal preoperative radiologic findings were found to have cognitive impairment at 3 months postoperatively (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of brain injury were similar after off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Preoperative cerebral magnetic resonance imaging can be used to predict the risk for cognitive dysfunction after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
