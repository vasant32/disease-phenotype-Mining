A case of multidrug resistance central nervous system tuberculosis is described. During the initial 6 months of therapy, intracranial embolic spread of tuberculomas from exudates around the proximal left middle cerebral artery was seen. This phenomenon was reported earlier. Further management, therapeutic considerations, particularly with secondary and tertiary line of antitubercular medication and neuroimaging are discussed.
