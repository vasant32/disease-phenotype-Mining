A previously healty 43-year-old woman developed bilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion, thrombocytopenia, and multiple thrombi of arteries in the spleen. No underlying cause of her thrombotic disease was detected except for a factor VIII level that was elevated fivefold. An etiological relationship between the cerebral occlusive disease and elevated factor VIII level is suggested. We recommend that factor VIII levels be assayed in patients with stroke when an underlying disorder is not identified.
