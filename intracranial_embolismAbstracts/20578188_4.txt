BACKGROUND: Carotid stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to carotid endoarterectomy also in elderly patients with discrepant results. However, the use of proximal neuroprotection devices have not been evaluated in octogenarians. PURPOSE: The aim of this multicenter prospective registry was to demonstrate that CAS in octogenarians is safe and effective if performed in high-volume centers by experienced operators. METHODS: From July 2005 to May 2009, a total of 198 octogenarians patients, in three different institutions, were included in this registry. All patients underwent CAS using proximal endovascular occlusion device (Mo.Ma. device Invatec, Roncadelle, Italy). An independent neurologist evaluated all patients. The primary endpoint was death and stroke rate at 30 days. RESULTS: 198 octogenarians (135 men; mean age: 83.2 years) were included in the registry. 39.4% of the patients were symptomatic. Procedural success was 100%. In-hospital complications: Two minor and two major strokes (2.02%) occurred. No device-related complications and no serious access site complication were noted. Between discharge and 30-day follow-up, one patient died due to a cardiac arrest. The overall 30-day combined stroke/death rate was 2.52%, resulting in 1.61% event incidence in asymptomatic and 3.9% in symptomatic patients (P = ns). Logistic regression did not identify independent predictor of neurological events, except in the female gender. CONCLUSION: This multicenter prospective registry shows that CAS performed with proximal flow blockage is safe and feasible also in octogenarians. Thirty days death/stroke rates are similar to those of the overall population and within the International guidelines.
