The authors describe the case report of a young woman in whom a left atrial myxoma causing cerebral embolism was diagnosed by echocardiography. On the ninth day after the development of neurologic symptoms the tumor was excised by an emergency intervention. After the operation the condition of the patient improved considerably.
