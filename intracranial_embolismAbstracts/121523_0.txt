34 patients aged between 17 and 62 years underwent triple valve replacement, 14 of whom exclusively with Starr-Edwards prosthesis; 25 patients were operated at Stage III and 4 at Stage IV of the NYHA classification; the operative mortality was 14%, the late mortality 21%. The actuarial survival curve shows 66% survival at 5 years; in all, 21 good results were obtained with a follow-up ranging from 3 months to 11 years (average 41 months). A notable late complication specific to these patients was dysfunction of the tricuspid prosthesis; a gradient across the tricuspid prosthesis was observed in 14 postoperative catheter studies; one of these patients had to be reoperated for thrombosis of a Starr-Edwards tricuspid prosthesis. Analysis of the results of this series suggests that surgery is beneficial, especially when the very precarious preoperative state of these patients is taken into consideration.
