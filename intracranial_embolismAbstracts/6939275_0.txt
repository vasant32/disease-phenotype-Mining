The authors examined 23 brains of female patients who died during pregnancy or after delivery. Four clinical groups were distinguished: 1. sepsis, 2. gestosis, 3. patients with cardiac diseases, 4. other cases of death. General autopsy on all the dead patients was performed. Macroscopically the brain revealed the signs of oedema and herniationes. Microscopic findings showed in the sepsis and gestosis groups, distinct changes in small blood vessels. Their walls were often statified and impregnated with fibrin. In the cases with the DIC syndrome microthrombosis could be seen. Only in 2 patients cerebral arterial occlusion was noted. Neurons revealed the secondary changes described as anoxic encephalopathy.
