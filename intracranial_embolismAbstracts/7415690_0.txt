Cases of neurovascular disorders in patients with malignant tumours of the viscera are described in neurological literature insufficiently. In this connection the author reports about two males and three females aged 25 to 78 years suffering from malignant tumours of the lungs, stomach, and prostate with concomitant atherosclerosis, late toxemia of pregnancy and uveomeningitis. These patients developed neurovascular disorders that have led to lethal outcomes. On the basis of clinical and pathoanatomic findings the role of malignant tumours of the viscera in the pathogenesis of neuromuscular disorders is discussed.
