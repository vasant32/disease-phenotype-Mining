Five patients who had delayed stroke after cardiac surgery underwent intraarterial administration of a fibrinolytic agent for thromboembolism (n = 4) or thrombosis (n = 1) of the cerebral artery. Complete recanalization of the occluded artery was obtained in 3 patients and partial recanalization in 2. Additional angioplasty for basilar artery stenosis was performed in 1 patient. No patients exhibited rebleeding into the pericardial space or wound bleeding. All patients survived with moderate or full functional recovery. Immediate cerebral angiography and local thrombolysis may improve functional outcome and survival in patients with postcardiotomy cerebral thromboembolism.
