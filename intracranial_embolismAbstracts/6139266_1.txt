Ten proven cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis have been reviewed, in which all had CT scans during their first 3 weeks of illness. An attempt was made to correlate the neuropathologic basis of the disease with the CT findings. Progression of the CT changes with the course of illness and treatment is emphasized. Usual indications for CT imaging of the brain in patients with meningitis are: detection of subdural empyema or effusion, hydrocephalus, infarct, cerebritis and abscess. Widespread cerebral damage can be more fully evaluated with iodine contrast infusion if clinically indicated. CT scanning has proven to be a valuable indicator of such complications and useful predictor of clinical recovery or residual neurologic sequelae.
