Mechanical circulatory support is successfully applied to patients with low cardiac output. The MEDOS-System provides pulsatile ventricular assistance for patients of all age groups, including neonates. We report our experience with seven consecutive pediatric patients with the MEDOS-VAD. The indication was bridge to transplantation in all patients. Mean age was 7.3 +/- 6.5 years (range 0.75-16.9 years) and mean weight was 26.3 +/- 21.7 kg (range 5.9-60 kg). Perioperative survival was 100%; complications occurred in six patients (86%; two cerebral embolism/bleeding, two rethoracotomy, two exchange of pump chamber due to thrombus formation after 4 and 9 days). Mean duration of support was 20.4 +/- 10.8 days (range 6-38 days). Bilirubin decreased from 3.5 +/- 2.6 mg/d to 2.1 +/- 1.2 mg/d. Hospital mortality was three of seven patients who did not receive an organ offer in time. All patients who underwent subsequent heart transplantation (four of seven patients; 57%) were discharged from the hospital. Mechanical circulatory support with the MEDOS-System can be performed successfully in pediatric patients of any age. Secondary organ functions improve under this pulsatile circulatory assistance. Hemorrhage and thromboembolic events are the most frequent complications.
