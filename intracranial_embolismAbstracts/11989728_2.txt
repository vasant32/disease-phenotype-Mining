Very little research has been done in the area of rehabilitation of the visual perceptual deficits observed after Balint's syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by difficulties with visual scanning, dysmetria secondary to visual perceptual deficits, and an inability to perceive more than 1 object at a time. This article describes the effects of a neuropsychological treatment protocol on a 23-year-old patient who suffered a fat embolism involving the territory of the posterior cerebral arteries. A neuropsychological evaluation carried out 12 months after the brain embolism disclosed Balint's syndrome, alexia without agraphia, visual agnosia, prosopagnosia, and memory impairments. The rehabilitation protocol included both visuoperceptual retraining and a functional program designed to provide rehabilitation in contexts that were meaningful to the patient. After 1 year of treatment, a second neuropsychological evaluation was carried out. Significant improvement was demonstrated in terms of both objective testing and the return of an integrated and productive lifestyle.
