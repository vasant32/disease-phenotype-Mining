One hundred and eight cases of sequelae of cerebro-vascular accident were randomly divided into two groups temporal point group (TG, 58 cases) and body acupuncture group (BG, 50 cases). It was shown that after 30 treatments the therapeutic effects were significantly different statistically (P < 0.01) between the two groups. The effect in TG was better than that in BG. It indicates that the two acupuncture therapies can improve blood rheology in patients. The ameliorative function in TG was better than that in BG.
