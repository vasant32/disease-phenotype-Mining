The authors performed 451 transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) investigations over a period of three years and four months. Atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) was found in 40 cases. Of these, protrusion of the atrial septum towards the right atrium was observed in 17 cases, whilst oscillation of the atrial septum was noted in 23 cases. ASA was associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO) in ten patients, with type II. ASD in nine patients, with other congenital heart disease in six patients, and with other organic heart disease in eight patients. In three cases either an embolus or a tumor was detected in the left atrium, whilst in four cases with ASA there were no other organic cardiac disorders found. In ten patients there was a history of cerebral embolisation. Of these two had chronic atrial fibrillation, whilst the others had sinusrhythm. Of those who had cerebral embolisation, four patients had PFO, one patient had left atrial and auricular thrombi, whilst in four patients various organic heart problems (ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy) were detected. In one patient with ASA there was no other cardiac abnormality detected. The authors conclude that ASA, which is often associated with PFO and ASD (in 25.0% and 22.5% of their cases, respectively) is detected in around eight percent of the patients who undergo TEE. ASA particularly when associated with PFO should be considered as a potential source of cerebral emboli. Indeed, cerebral embolisation occurred in 25% of their patients with ASA. It is recommended, that patients with ASA are treated with acetyl salicylic acid, whilst in patients with ASA and PFO anticoagulant therapy is the treatment of choice. In case of cerebral embolisation, or repeated cerebral ischemic attacks, operative interventions should be considered.
