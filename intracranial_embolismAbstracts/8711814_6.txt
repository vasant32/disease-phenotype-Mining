BACKGROUND: Aneurysm of the ascending aorta is rarely reported as the source of emboli. We report a patient with a minor stroke in whom a saccular aneurysm of the left sinus of Valsalva was diagnosed as the presumed source of cerebral embolism. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old right-handed woman presented 10 days after sudden onset of right-sided hemiparesis. Her history was uneventful apart from an acute inflammation of the subcutaneous tissue in the right leg 20 years earlier. A diastolic murmur was heard best over the third left intercostal space. Results of duplex ultrasound investigation of the cerebral vessels, chest x-ray, and electrocardiography and biochemical and hematological variables were normal. CT of the brain showed a small hypodense area in the left frontal region. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography detected moderate aortic regurgitation and a saccular aneurysm originating from the left sinus of Valsalva. The aneurysm had calcified walls and contained thrombotic material. Surgical closure of the aneurysm with a pericardial patch was performed to prevent recurrent embolism and rupture. Coaptation of the aortic valves was achieved, and no residual aortic regurgitation could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that an unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm should be included in the list of sources of embolism. Transthoracic echocardiography establishes the diagnosis. Transesophageal echocardiography provides additional information about the origin and size of the aneurysm and presence of thrombotic material. Surgical closure of the aneurysm prevents rupture and recurrent embolism and possibly corrects aortic regurgitation.
