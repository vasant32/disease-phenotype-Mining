BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aims of this prospective and multicenter study were to determine the frequency of anticardiolipin and antinuclear antibodies in an unselected ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke population and to evaluate the clinical significance of these autoantibodies. METHODS: Over a 1-year period, we collected plasma from 481 consecutive patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke attending four different hospitals. Blood (10 mL) was drawn from each subject into a citrated glass tube. Plasma was obtained immediately by centrifugation and was stored at -70 degrees C until use. Concentrations of IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were measured at room temperature in normal (not heat-treated) plasma by standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All sera were treated by indirect immunofluorescence on mouse liver and kidney sections for antinuclear antibodies. RESULTS: A total of 481 patients (325 men, 156 women) 16 to 90 years in age (mean age, 61 years) were studied. Anticardiolipin antibodies were present in 5 of 481 (1.04%) patients. One patient was IgG positive and four patients were IgM positive. Of 481 patients, 35 (7.2%) were positive for antinuclear antibodies. Anti-DNA antibodies were not demonstrable in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies in a heterogeneous stroke population is possibly lower than reported. The routine screening of anticardiolipin and antinuclear antibodies in a stroke population is of questionable value.
