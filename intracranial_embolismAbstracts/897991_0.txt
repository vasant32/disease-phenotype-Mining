A patient operated upon for a carotico-cavernous fistula developed incipient cerebral infarction. Metaraminol was used for a period of eight days to produce a therapeutic elevation in blood pressure to prevent this complication. Its possible role in the management of similar complications in the post-operative period of intracranial aneurysms and post angiography is discussed.
