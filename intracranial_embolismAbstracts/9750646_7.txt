Cerebrovascular disorders are frequently associated with sickle cell disease, mainly in homozygous children. We report the case a 25-old-patient with known sickle cell disease who presented with coma inaugurated by manifestations of intracranial hypertension. CT revealed bilateral thalamic infarcts and angiography confirmed the thrombosis of internal cerebral veins. Treatment included heparin and blood transfusion. Severe cerebral oedema resulted in the lethal outcome three days later.
