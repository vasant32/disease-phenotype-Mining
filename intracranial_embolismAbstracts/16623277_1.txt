OBJECTIVES: To prospectively investigate the prevalence of definite and potential sources of cardiogenic embolism and embolism from ascending aorta and aortic arch in patients with a cryptogenic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). MATERIAL/METHODS: The study group consisted of 218 consecutive patients (146 males, mean age 59.4 +/- 11.5, range 38-83 years) without significant stenoses of carotic and vertebral arteries. All patients underwent biplane/multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). 77.5% of patients suffered a stroke and 22.5% had a TIA. Sinus rhythm was in 74.8% of the patients, atrial fibrillation in 22.0% and pacemaker rhythm in 3.2%. RESULTS: 1. Definite source of embolism was identified in 21.6% of patients. The most frequent finding was a thrombus of the left atrial (LA) appendage - 12.4%. Less frequently found were mobile thrombus of aortic arch - 3.7%, thrombus of LA body - 2.3%, left ventricular thrombus - 2.3%, thrombus of valvular prosthesis - 1.4% and heart tumor - 0.5%. 2. The total prevalence of potential sources of embolism was 61.5%. Only potential source (without definite source) was demonstrated in 52.3% of patients. Very frequently were found patent foramen ovale - 58.3% and atherosclerosis of ascending aorta or aortic arch - 53.7%. Further sources were LA spontaneous echocontrast - 21.1%, reduced function of LA appendage - 18.3%, atrial septal aneurysm - 7.8%, atrial septal defect - 1.4%, cardiac foreign body - 0.5%. 3. TEE did not reveal any source of embolism in 26.1% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: 1. 21.6% of the patients suffering from stroke/TIA without hemodynamically significant stenoses of extracranial cerebral arteries had a definite cardiogenic or aortic source of embolism, 2. additional 52.3% of patients had only potential source of embolism (without definite source), 3. we consider TEE necessary in patients with stroke/TIA without a known etiology, despite complete neurological examination and transthoracic echocardography.
