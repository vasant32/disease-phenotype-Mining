Thrombolysis may achieve recanalization in cases of occlusion of the cerebral vessels. If therapy is initiated in good time, development of cerebral infarction may be at least partially prevented. Thrombolytic treatment was performed in 14 patients at the Wagner-Jauregg Hospital within a period of one year. Urokinase was given locally, while rtPA was applied locally and/or systemically. 4 patients had an occlusion of the internal carotid artery, 6 an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, and 4 an occlusion of the basilar artery. Complete recanalization was achieved in 6 patients, partial recanalization in 4, and no recanalization in 4. The neurological outcome of the cases with complete recanalization was good with the exception of one patients who died. Partial recanalization resulted in a fair outcome in 2 patients, while the other 2 died. 3 out of the 4 patients in whom no recanalization was achieved died. Our findings show that this form of therapy may considerably improve the natural history of the disease, provided recanalization is achieved in good time. They encourage us to continue this form of therapy and to work at improving the therapeutic criteria.
