The case history of a 34-year-old male with a neuro-ocular Behçet and left sided hemiparesis is reported. On computerized tomography (CT) of the brain using contrast medium a homogeneous enhancement was seen. This conforms with the very few similar reported cases of Behçet's syndrome and is in discordance with the CT findings in cases of cerebral stroke. We conclude, therefore, that the appearance of a homogeneous enhancement on contrast CT can be of diagnostic value in neuro-Behçet.
