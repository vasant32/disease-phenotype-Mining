Hindbrain transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) culminating in posterior circulation stroke are described in five children. Atlanto-axial subluxation and angiographical documentation of C1 to C2 level arterial pathology are documented in one patient. Four additional patients with nearly identical clinical presentations, posterior fossa TIAs, stroke and basilar angiographical pathology are reviewed. A mechanical traumatic etiology is suggested. Unexplained transient repeated brain stem and/or cerebellar sympotomatology may be due to extracranial vetebral artery stenosis or occlusion by atlanto-axial instability. After appropriate documentation, stabilization may prevent further TIAs or strokes.
