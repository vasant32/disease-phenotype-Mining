Central nervous system involvement in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cryoglobulinemia is uncommon. We report a patient with HCV-related type II mixed cryoglobulinemia who suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) associated with deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The mechanism of TIA was diagnosed as paradoxical embolism, and we suspect that the cause of the TIA was associated with HCV-related type II mixed cryoglobulinemia.
