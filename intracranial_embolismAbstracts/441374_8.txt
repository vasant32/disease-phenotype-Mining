Amicar (epsilon-aminocaproic acid) has been used in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage to promote clotting. However, cerebral thrombosis has been reported in various vascular compartments following its use. The authors describe 2 patients who had cerebral angiography after Amicar therapy and demonstrated thrombosis unrelated to vascular spasm or technical complications of angiography. Careful screening is needed in patients treated with Amicar to determine if an increased risk of thrombosis exists.
