Radionuclide angiography, using high resolution equipment, is a sensitive noninvasive, safe, and rapid diagnostic test for ischemia of the anterior circulation of the brain. The test permits recognition of focally increased or decreased circulation immediately following the onset of a neurologic deficit. The sensitivity of the test is improved by using multiple projections of the head. The distribution of the anterior cerebral artery is best seen in the anterior projection; the lateral projection is used to resolve the superior and inferior divisions of the middle cerebral artery or to identify multiple regions of ischemia. Both projections should be used routinely.
