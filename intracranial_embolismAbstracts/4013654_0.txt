Quantitative and/or qualitative changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology were observed in 31.5% of 225 samples, obtained from patients with recent non-haemorrhagic cerebral infarctions. These changes were variable and did not correlate with the stroke pattern or with the topography of the softening. The CSF cytological abnormalities were statistically different according to the aetiology of the stroke. In those infarctions, due to vasculitis lesions, either of infectious or of auto-immune nature, an abnormal cytology pattern was more frequently observed than in those of atherosclerotic thrombo-embolic origin.
