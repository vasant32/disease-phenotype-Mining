A technique for safe angioplasty of atherosclerotic stenosis of internal and common carotid arteries is described in which temporary balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery is used to prevent cerebral embolization during manifestation of ulcerated plaques. Its successful use in six atherosclerotic stenosis is described. Five angioplasties of postsurgical stenoses are also reported in which the technique of temporary occlusion was not used. The future of carotid artery angioplasty is discussed.
