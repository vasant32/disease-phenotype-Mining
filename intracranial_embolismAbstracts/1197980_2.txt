Amyotrophy of cerebral origin was analyzed in 12 hemiplegics by means of comparative histological, histoenzymological, histographic and biochemical analysis of biopsies carried out in symmetrical zones. In the 6 cases in which atrophy predominated on the paralyzed side, it occurred early, the deficiency affecting the upper limb in particular and the sensory disturbance being irregular. Attempted numeration of the motor units remaining, according to the "incremential" method of stimulation, suggests a numerical reduction on the hemipelgic side. Despite reservations and general criticisms of this method, its comparative value, although approximate, must be acknowledged. However, although amyotrophy presumes a transsynaptic change in trophic function to have taken place in the peripheral neurone, neuronal depopulation--if one accepts it--cannot be other than functional.
