Air embolism is known to be a complicating factor in several clinical settings, including thoracic, cardiovascular and neurosurgical operations, central line placement, penetrating thoracic and cranial trauma and haemodialysis. Computed tomography (CT) is useful for showing cerebral air embolism. However, CT demonstration of massive air in all of the major cerebral arteries is extremely rare. In this report, we present a 45-year-old woman with cerebrovascular pneumoangiogram on postmortem CT examination after an unsuccessful posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and discuss the possible mechanisms of pneumoangiogram.
