Two patients with acquired dysgraphia were reported. The patients' performance in various written and oral spelling tasks converge in support of the hypothesis that they have selective damage, within the spelling system, to the Graphemic Buffer. Although the patients present with comparable patterns of error types, they differ in the distribution of errors as a function of letter position in words. The patients' patterns of errors are compared to previously reported patterns of spelling errors in dysgraphic patients and are discussed in terms of hypothesized mechanisms that operate on the representations that are stored in the Graphemic Buffer.
