The authors describe a case of fat embolism syndrome in a 20-year-old male. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated multiple small cerebral infarcts suggesting this is the cause of the associated cerebral dysfunction. He underwent chemotherapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy and recovered rapidly. MR imaging can provide prognostic indications in fat embolism syndrome.
