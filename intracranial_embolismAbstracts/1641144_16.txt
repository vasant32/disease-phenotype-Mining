We report 10 patients with severe occlusive disease of the vertebral artery (VA) origin in the neck with intra-arterial embolism to the posterior circulation. The VA lesions in seven patients were complete occlusions, and three patients had severe atherostenosis. All patients had strokes in the vertebrobasilar territory. The most frequent recipient sites of intra-arterial embolism were the intracranial VA-posterior inferior cerebellar artery region (8), and the distal basilar artery (BA) and its superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral artery branches (7). Two patients had pontine infarction due to BA embolism. The most common clinical signs were due to cerebellar infarction. Atherosclerotic disease of the VA origin has features in common with disease of the internal carotid artery origin. Both have similar risk factors and demography, and each can cause strokes by intracranial intra-arterial embolism.
