During a 5 year period at Port Moresby General Hospital in Papua New Guinea. 140 patients had carotid angiograms. Three quarters of the patients were male. Average age for all patients was 29 years. 44% of the patients had detectable abnormalities, the commonest being subdural haematoma and neoplasm. Other abnormalities found included aneurysm, brain abscess, tuberculoma and thrombrosed middle cerebral artery. The findings show many similarities to a reported series in Nigeria but differs from a Uganda series in which haemotoma was much more commonly found.
