One hundred fifty patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were randomly assigned to receive intravenous 10% dextran 40 or placebo. Transcranial Doppler monitoring of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery 0 to 1 hour postoperatively detected embolic signals in 57% of placebo and 42% of dextran patients, with overall embolic signal counts 46% less for dextran (p = 0.052). Two to 3 hours postoperatively, embolic signals were present in 45% of placebo and 27% of dextran patients, with embolic signal counts 64% less for dextran (p = 0.040). We conclude that dextran reduces embolic signals within 3 hours of CEA.
