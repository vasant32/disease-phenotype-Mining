From a population of patients with acute cerebral infarction one hundred were selected and divided into two groups, with comparable neurological deficit and risk factors. To one group of patients glycerol was administered, the other group served as a control. Neurological deficit was scored on the day of admission and in the next 4 weeks. There was no noticeable beneficial effect of glycerol administration in acute cerebral infarction.
