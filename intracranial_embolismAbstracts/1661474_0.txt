A study was made of blood coagulation, physiological anticoagulants and fibrinolysis in 120 elderly patients with cerebrovascular diseases, including 50 subjects in the acute period of ischemic brain stroke. To estimate activation of the fibrinolytic system, the levels of plasminogen and free plasmin were measured. Phasic changes in the system of blood coagulation were detected, variants of antithrombin III depression were delineated, and a relationship was established between the activity of enzymes of the fibrinolytic system and the site of an ischemic focus in the brain. Five coagulopathic syndromes of the acute period of brain stroke were distinguished, the principles of their differentiated treatment were based.
