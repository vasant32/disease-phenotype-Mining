In 14 stroke patients showing angiographic recanalization of the occluded internal carotid artery or middle cerebral arterial axis, the postrecanalized angiograms demonstrated several findings that have been considered to be generally rare in cerebral infarction. These findings principally consisted of narrowing of arterial caliber in six cases (43 percent), mass effect in eight cases (57 percent) and capillary blush in five cases (36 percent).
