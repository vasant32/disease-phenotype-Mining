 BACKGROUND: Embolic infarctions from the heart are known to cause multiple scattered infarct lesions as well as single, large territorial infarctions. However, it remains unknown which factors contribute to these different infarction patterns in patients with potential cardiac sources of embolism (PCSE). METHODS: We examined 388 ischemic stroke patients with a high-risk PCSE using diffusion-weighted imaging. Infarction patterns were categorized into a single large lesion, a single small lesion, confluent and additional lesions, or small scattered lesions. The relationships between infarction patterns and clinical and hematologic parameters were investigated. RESULTS: Of the 388 patients, a single large lesion was detected in 139 (35.8%), a single small lesion in 29 (7.5%), confluent and additional lesions in 171 (44.1%), and small scattered lesions in 49 (12.7%). Prior use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulant were associated with the pattern of small scattered lesions and a single small lesion, respectively. Additionally, higher white blood cell counts were associated with confluent and additional lesions. The type of high-risk PCSE was not related to a specific infarction pattern. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that platelet function and inflammatory processes may directly affect the thrombus formation in the cardiac chamber.
