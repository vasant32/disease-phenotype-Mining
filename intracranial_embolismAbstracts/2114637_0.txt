Arteriovenous fistulas of the lung occur as a disease limited to the lung, or as a pulmonary manifestation of hereditary Rendu-Osler-Weber's disease. Typical complications are haemoptysis, haemothorax and cerebral embolism. We report on 3 patients in whom arteriovenous fistulas of the lung were removed by wedge excision or lobectomy. One of them had already suffered cerebral infarction. The indication for operative removal of single lesions is always given with respect to the severe complications of this disease. Decrease of the right-to-left shunt volume can usually be achieved.
