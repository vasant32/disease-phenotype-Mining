Three cases of palinopsia (visual perseveration) are described. In case, evidence pointed to a lesion in the right occipitotemporal region. Pathological findings are reported in one of the three. Previous reports have stressed the importance of posteriorly placed cerebral lesions, more commonly right sided than left, but have not demonstrated more precise localisation within the hemisphere.
