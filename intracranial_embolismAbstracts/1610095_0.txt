The authors report a case which is unusual because of the late presentation, as a cerebral embolism, of a left intraventricular thrombus six years after an infarction. This thrombus was absent at the acute stage of the infarction. The conditions surrounding the development of a thrombus after an infarction are reviewed. This is a common complication at the acute stage of an anterior infarction, notably when there is apical akinesia. The late onset of these thrombi has not been extensively studied in the literature. This would appear to be a fairly rare event but which, as shown by our case, pleads in favour of very prolonged anticoagulant treatment after certain myocardial infarctions.
