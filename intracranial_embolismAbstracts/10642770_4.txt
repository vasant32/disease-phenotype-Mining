A case of cerebral arterial air embolism (CAAE) occurring from inadvertent injection of air during aortic root angiography is presented. Prompt treatment by suspending the patient briefly in a vertical head-down position beside the catheterization table appeared to be life-saving and resulted in complete neurological recovery. This approach may offer the first immediate therapy for CAAE. Cathet. Cardiovasc. Intervent. 49:185-187, 2000.
