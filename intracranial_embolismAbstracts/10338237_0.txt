Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is being diagnosed more frequently with the use of advanced radiologic imaging. The presentation of CVT includes a wide spectrum of nonspecific symptoms with headache predominating. We present a case with acute, severe headache. The evaluation included a head computed tomography (CT) scan that was normal. The presence of opacified sinuses led to treatment for sinusitis. The patient returned the following day with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study identified an isolated cortical venous thrombosis. This patient was treated with anticonvulsant and anticoagulation therapy. A CVT is an unusual cause of headache and should be considered in patients with atypical presentation or associated seizure, or who are refractory to current therapy. Diagnosis may be made with MRI. Resolution and complete recovery are possible with appropriate therapy.
