 OBJECTIVE: High short-term successful rate was reported for catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), we analyzed the long-term outcome (success rate, anticoagulation therapy and embolism event, anti-arrhythmic therapy and death post procedure) of catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF in this study. METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2004, 106 consecutive patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF underwent catheter ablation and were followed-up for (60.7 + or - 11.8) months. Segmental pulmonary vein isolation (SPVI) was routinely performed by radiofrequency energy under the guidance of circular mapping catheter. The patients were followed up with 24 h-holter, ECG, telephone or letter. Data on recurrence of AF, the anticoagulation medication and the incidence of embolism, anti-arrhythmic therapy were obtained. RESULTS: There were 9 patients lost to follow up. In the remaining 97 patients [65 males, (54.8 + or - 11.2) years old], 3 cases died from cancer, sinus rhythm was maintained in 68 patients (Group S, 72.3%) and AF recurrence evidenced in 26 patients (Group R, 27.7%). In Group S, 56 patients (82.4%) discontinued anticoagulation medication, and 12 patients continued to take aspirin. There was no embolism event in Group S during follow-up. In Group R, 1 patient continued to take warfarin; 11 patients continued to take aspirin and 2 patients suffered from cerebral embolism. Anticoagulation medication was discontinued in 14 patients (53.8%) and 1 patient suffered form cerebral embolism. The incidence of embolism event in Group R is significantly higher than in Group S (P < 0.01). More patients discontinued anti-arrhythmic medication in Group S than in Group R (80.9% vs. 56.0%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Catheter ablation is associated with satisfactory long-term success rate, reduced anti-arrhythmia medication, improved quality of life in patients with paroxysmal AF.
