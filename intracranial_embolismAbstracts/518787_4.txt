A heavily calcified left atrial myxoma in a man aged 53 was diagnosed from the plain chest x-ray film and confirmed by echocardiography. There  was also moderate mitral regurgitation caused by a floppy mitral valve. Before a systemic embolus is considered to have arisen from a floppy mitral valve, echocardiography must be performed.
