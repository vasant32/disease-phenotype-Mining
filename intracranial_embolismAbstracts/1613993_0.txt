Clopidogrel is a new thieno-pyridine derivative and has a more potent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation, dependent on ADP rather than ticlopidine. In a phase I study performed in Japan, significant inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation and prolongation of bleeding time was observed in the dose range of 25, 50 and 75 mg. These effects were comparable to 200 or 300 mg of ticlopidine. Antithrombotic effects have also been shown in experimental animal models. Clopidogrel is expected to reduce the incidence of neutropenia since smaller doses are sufficient to suppress platelet aggregation compared to ticlopidine. Clopidogrel has been proven to be a potent and well-tolerated antiplatelet agent for atherosclerosis patients at risk of thrombosis, in Europe.
