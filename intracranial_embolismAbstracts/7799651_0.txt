85 cases of apoplexy were treated with scalp acupuncture, including 52 cases by the method of slow-rapid reinforcing-reducing and 33 cases by the method of flat twisting. The total effective rates differed insignificantly between the 2 methods. However, in respects of improving the myodynamia and motile functional disturbances of the limbs, the method of slow-rapid reinforcing-reducing was markedly superior to the method of flat twisting.
