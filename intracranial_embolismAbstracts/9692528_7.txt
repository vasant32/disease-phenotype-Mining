Thrombogenesis in the left atrial appendage (LAA) has been related to the special morphology of this cavity and to its size and degree of dysfunction. However, no study has focused on LAA function in conjunction with left atrial (LA) function in both sinus rhythm (SR) and nonrheumatic idiopathic atrial fibrillation (AF) in relation to clinical status (cardioembolic stroke). Forty-three patients in SR (14 patients with stroke, 29 control subjects) and 45 patients in AF (27 patients with stroke, 18 control subjects) were examined by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Baseline clinical characteristics and standard transthoracic and transesophageal measurements of the LA and LAA (size, fractional area change, flow measurements, spontaneous echo contrast, and thrombus) were recorded and compared in relation to cardiac rhythm. Patients in the stroke-SR group showed a significant decrease of fractional area change in the LA (32%+/-15%) and LAA (34%+/-15%) in relation to control subjects (43%+/-10%, p = 0.035, 49%+/-13%, p = 0.006, respectively). Patients in the stroke-AF group showed significant reduction of appendage flow measurements (outward velocity = 22+/-13 vs 33+/-19 cm/sec, p = 0.036), whereas no differences were detected in the center of the LA. In multiple regression analysis, the presence of cardioembolic stroke was positively associated with the presence of spontaneous echo contrast (p = 0.0253) and spontaneous echo contrast negatively associated with appendage inward flow velocity (p<0.001). Cardioembolic stroke in patients in SR is associated with a global decrease of shortening in both cavities and in patients with AF, with a reduction of LAA flow parameters. Patients with spontaneous echo contrast, thrombus, or both showed further reduction of shortening and flow velocities in both cavities, indicating a more advanced stage of dysfunction.
