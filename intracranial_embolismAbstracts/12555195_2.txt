Major orthopaedic procedures that involve instrumentation of the medullary canal are well known to produce showers of embolic debris including fat, bone fragments, marrow constituents, and cement. A growing literature has identified paradoxic cerebral embolism as a rare but serious consequence of the passage of these emboli through an intracardiac right-to-left shunt to the cerebral arterial circulation. We report 2 cases of paradoxic cerebral embolism after cemented total knee arthroplasty and propose a novel treatment plan to prevent recurrent stroke during subsequent surgery.
