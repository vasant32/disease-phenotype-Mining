Microemboli passing to the cerebral circulation during cardiopulmonary bypass can contribute to postoperative neurologic dysfunction. Many studies conclude that air microbubbles predominantly are responsible for this problem. A dynamic bubble trap (DBT) was developed to diminish the number of microbubbles in the arterial line of extracorporeal circulation. The DBT is able to substantially reduce the number of air microbubbles, as shown in two patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, where a high number of microbubbles was assessed. Although a 40-micron arterial filter was used, many bubbles larger than 40 microns occurred in the arterial line. The DBT reduced the number of large microbubbles from 2,267 to 67 in patient 1 and from 897 to 61 in patient 2.
