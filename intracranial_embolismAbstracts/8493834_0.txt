From 1987-1991 we performed 20 balloon occlusions in 15 patients with intracranial aneurysms. In 9 patients procedures were technically successful however long term complications included three deaths. In spite of the advancements in the balloon catheter technology fatalities occur restricting the use of percutaneous balloon occlusion to patients with unclippable aneurysms.
