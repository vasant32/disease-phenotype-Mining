A case of left atrial myxoma with repeated multiple cerebral emboli is reported. A-44-year-old man first developed a sudden right hemiparesis in October 1969. After intensive physical theraphy, strength improved and he was able to return to his work. In March 1970, he suddenly lost consciousness and remained comatose for a day. Upon waking, he had a profound right hemiparesis, motor aphasia and Gerstmann's syndrome. He was admitted to Hiroshima City Hospital on August 1, 1970. The cardiac examination, including an electrocardiogram, was entirely normal. Laboratory studies revealed a normal blood count and urinalysis; erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated (32mm/hour). On a left cerebral angiographic study, performed on September 6, 1971, multiple aneurysmal dilatations of the branches of the left middle cerebral artery were demonstrated. No specific diagnosis was made. In January 1973, he developed dysarthria, dysphagia and quadriplegia because of the recurrent cerebral attacks. He had a high temperature continuously for three days and died on May 30, 1974. At autopsy a myxoma with the peduncle was attached to the septal wall of left atrium, and there were old infarcts in the brain, the myocardium and the kidneys.
