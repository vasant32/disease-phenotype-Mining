Two cases of cardiac tumors were studied by computerized tomography. The first patient presented with cerebral embolization from left atrial tumor. Chest X-ray showed calcification in the region of the atria. A 2-"D" echo showed tumors of the right and left atrium. CT studies with contrast confirmed tumors of right and left atria its relationship with atrial septum and calcification. This is the first case report in the literature of multicentric biatrial tumors thought to be myxomas shown by computerized tomography. The second patient presented with weight loss, progressive weakness, shortness of breath and palpitations. A 2-"D" echo showed a large pedunculated left atrial mass prolapsing across the mitral valve into the left ventricle. CT with contrast showed large mass 3.5 X 4.5 cm in the left atrium. At surgery, this was proved to be a left atrial myxoma.
