Two surgical cases of aortic arch aneurysms are presented. Retrograde (venoarterial) cerebral perfusion during circulatory arrest under deep hypothermia was performed to evacuate air and debris in cerebral vessels and preserve cerebral tissue. On postoperative day 1, the patients were conscious and alert with no neurological deficit. This technique is simple and can be applied during standard cardiopulmonary bypass. The technique is useful to avoid cerebral air and thromboembolisms.
