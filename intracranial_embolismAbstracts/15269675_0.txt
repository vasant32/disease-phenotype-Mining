A 64-year-old man with alien hand syndrome presented with abnormal feelings in the left upper limb, associated with an intermanual conflict. There were no clinical signs of frontal or parietal apraxia. This syndrome was induced by an infarct localized in the right posterior area of the splenium, subsequent to a cardiogenic embolus. This observation enlightens the rising syndrome of callosal type alien syndrome due to a posterior callosal infarct.
