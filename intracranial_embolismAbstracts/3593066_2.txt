A 30-year-old man had relapsing and remitting neurologic symptoms, which had been diagnosed as multiple sclerosis for nine years. Eventually, an unusual left ventricular tumor was discovered. The pathologic diagnosis was cavernous angiectasia, which, to our knowledge, is a previously undescribed histologic entity. Embolization from cardiac tumors can mimic multiple sclerosis and multiple echocardiograms may be required for diagnosis.
