Bilateral axillary arterial cannulation for selective cerebral perfusion might minimize cerebral embolic complications during surgery on the ascending aorta and aortic arch. From March 2002 through February 2004, bilateral axillary arterial perfusion was applied in 12 consecutive patients (mean age, 61.3 years). Operative procedures were total arch replacement in 8 patients, hemiarch replacement in 1, and ascending aorta replacement in 3. Antegrade selective cerebral perfusion was established through vascular grafts anastomosed to the bilateral axillary arteries and a perfusion catheter placed directly into the left carotid artery. Bilateral axillary arterial perfusion through the grafts was successful in all patients. There were no early or late deaths and no incidence of neurologic deficit. There were no complications related to cannulation of the axillary arteries. Bleeding, temporary renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and graft infection occurred in one patient each; all recovered from these complications. Bilateral axillary arterial perfusion is feasible and effective for brain protection during surgery on the ascending aorta and aortic arch.
