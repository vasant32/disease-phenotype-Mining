A new model of internal carotid artery embolism was developed using autologous clot. The clot was prepared by incubating blood at room temperature for 2 hours to inactivate plasminogen activators and then refrigerating it at 4 degrees C for 22 hours. The purpose of the experiment was to devise a model of the intravascular lesion and not of stroke itself. The dog was chosen as the experimental animal since it has a maxillocarotid artery which permits collateral flow beyond proximal internal carotid artery occlusions. A volume of clot measuring 0.25 to 0.30 cc was sufficient to occlude the artery for 48 hours in 80% of the animals without causing major strokes. We have used this model to study clot radiolabeling and suggest it may also have application for evaluating thrombolytic drugs.
