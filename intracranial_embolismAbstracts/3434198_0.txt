Clinical, neuropsychological and radiological signs were studied in a patient suffering from pure alexia associated with right superior quadrantanopia. The lesion responsible for the defects was located in the periventricular white substance at the level of the left inferior occipitotemporal convolutions. These structures seem to constitute the pathway of the visual information channelled from the two hemispheres towards the language centres. The lesion therefore disconnects the angular gyrus from its visual information and gives rise to alexia without agraphia.
