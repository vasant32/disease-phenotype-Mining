A 61-year-old man who had been suffered from several episodes of cerebral infarction for 3 years complained of left-sided paresthesia and was pointed out hemorrhagic infarction in the right frontal area of the brain by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The echocardiography showed left atrial mass 9 cm in length attaching to the atrial septum, which was diagnosed as left atrial myxoma causing cerebral embolism. As serial MRI showed frequent episode of cerebral infarction, we performed surgical resection of the cardiac tumor on the 10th day after the onset of the neurological symptom. Anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass was maintained with 1.5 mg/kg of heparin sodium and 80 mg/hour of nafamostat mesilate (FUT). Postoperative course was uneventful without neurological deterioration.
