The incidence of aspergillosis in kidney transplant recipients is low and most commonly occurs in the early posttransplantation period. We report an unusual case of a 52-year-old female patient with Aspergillus endocarditis as a late complication after kidney transplantation, presumably spread from a necrosis in the gut, associated with previous cytomegalovirus colitis. As complications, the patient experienced septic embolization into the coronary and pulmonary arteries, and an infarction of the right parietal cortex and insula. The patient died as a result of global heart failure after a 10-day course of antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B plus 5-flucytosine during surgical valve replacement.
