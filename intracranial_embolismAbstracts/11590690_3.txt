Carotid artery angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) can be complicated by procedure-related distal embolization and thrombus formation, potentially resulting in neurological sequelae. Patient A had CAS of left internal carotid artery and had loss of vision in the left eye with no flow in the left ophthalmic artery. Patient B had CAS of right internal carotid artery and developed left sided hemiparesis with total occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery. A selective intra-arterial injection of 5 mg of abciximab locally followed by a bolus of 5 mg of abciximab intravenously resulted in complete resolution of the filling defect on repeat angiography after 10 min in both patients.
