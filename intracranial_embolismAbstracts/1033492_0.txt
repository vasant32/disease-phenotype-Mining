Radionuclide brain scans were compared with computer-assisted tomography (CAT) for the diagnosis of intracranial disorders in 297 patients. The diagnosis was confirmed in 281 patients who formed the population for the study. The radionuclide scan was false positive for 12 patients (3.9 percent) and false negative for eight (2.6 percent). The CAT was false positive for three patients (1 percent) and false negative for one (0.3 percent). In the 133 patients in whom both tests were negative, no evidence of central nervous system pathology has been found during the 6 to 18 month follow-up. Brain tumors and intracerebral hemorrhage are more readily detectable with CAT.
