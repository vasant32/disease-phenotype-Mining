This report graphically illustrates the consequences of flow augmentation through extracranial-intracranial bypass grafts. Propagation of clot from a thrombosed middle cerebral artery aneurysm into the middle cerebral artery produced transient ischemic attacks. Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass was performed to augment cerebral blood flow. Postoperative angiography demonstrated filling of the aneurysm through improved collateral channels. The role of bypass operation in the presence of an aneurysm and its contribution to collateral blood flow and clot lysis are discussed.
