 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Poststroke hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus are associated with lower thrombolytic efficacy and an increased risk of postischemic cerebral hemorrhage. We aimed to develop a rodent model of thrombolysis in diabetic stroke that mimics the clinical situation.  Method- Male 6-week Type I diabetic rats (14 weeks old) were subjected to embolic focal stroke and treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator at 1.5 hours. Reperfusion and 24-hour neurological outcomes were measured and compared with nondiabetic control rats. RESULTS: Diabetic rats exhibited resistance to thrombolytic reperfusion, larger infarction volumes, and increased intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: This animal model would be relevant to future studies investigating pathophysiological mechanisms and in developing new therapeutic approaches to enhance the efficacy of tissue-type plasminogen activator thrombolysis in stroke patients with diabetes or poststroke hyperglycemia.
