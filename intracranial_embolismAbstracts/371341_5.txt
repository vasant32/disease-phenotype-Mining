A non-intensive stroke unit of 10 beds has been started in the Medical Department, Serafimerlasarettet, Stockholm. The aim is to make diagnostic and therapeutic studies in unselected stroke patients. Patients with suspect cerebrovascular disease in the Casualty Department are admitted to the unit non-selectively and without any age limit. Relevant physical findings and laboratory data are followed and registered by code on special charts to make evaluation by computer possible. A preplanned investigative programme is adhered to. Strict criteria for diagnosis and treatment are followed. The experience and results from the first 100 patients treated in the Stroke Unit indicate that the unit is a good basis for both education and research.
