A scintigraphy with Indium-111 labelled platelets was performed in 11 patients with suspected brain embolism. In six patients, an intracardial thrombus was found: four in the region of the left ventricle and two in the left atrial. The echocardiography revealed no pathological findings in 2 of the 6 patients with positive scans. Angiography in both patients indicated occlusions of the carotis interna siphon, which frequently accompany embolisms. Subsequent angiographies four weeks later showed that the occlusions had reopened. The thrombus investigation, performed with the aid of Indium-111 platelet scintigraphy, appears to be a valuable extension of the present diagnostic potential in the determination of questionable cardial embolisms.
