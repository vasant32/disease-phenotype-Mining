We experienced a case of operation for acute type A aortic dissection using transapical aortic cannulation (TAC). A 62-year-old male with chest and back pain admitted to our hospital. The chest computed tomography (CT) showed the dissection of total aorta. Hemiarch repair (circulatory arrest time: 64 min, pump time: 152 min) was performed by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) established with bicaval cannulation and TAC in this case. The reason why we use TAC is that retrograde perfusion by femoral artery has a high-risk of malperfusion and cerebral embolism because of atheromatous change in aorta, and the use of the axillary artery can be troublesome because of the vessel's small diameter. We considered that in cases of acute aortic dissection, TAC is much safer and simpler than femoral or axillary cannulation.
