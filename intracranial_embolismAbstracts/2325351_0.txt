We report a 6 year old girl who developed acute chorea following cardiac surgery using hypothermia and total cardiopulmonary bypass. Rheumatic disease, cerebral embolism or hemorrhage were excluded. Cerebral hypoperfusion during surgery is the most probable cause for this neurologic event. Treatment with Tiaprid (Tiapridex) resulted in a rapid resolution of symptoms.
