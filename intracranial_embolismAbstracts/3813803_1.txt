The authors report a case of homocystinuria diagnosed in a 2 year-old boy presenting with psychomotor retardation and with widespread cerebral vascular thromboses, unusually severe at that age. The disease was of the pyridoxin-resistant type, for which use of remethylation activators led to a good biological result.
