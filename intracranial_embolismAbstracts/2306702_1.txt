Acute thrombosis within the lumen of the intracranial artery may occasionally be demonstrated on precontrast CT. The hyperdensity follows the course of the occluded segment of the vessel and an area of low attenuation in the territory of the involved artery is usually present, consistent with infarction. Usually, a single vessel is involved; occlusion of multiple branches occurs less commonly. This report demonstrates a case of diffuse bilateral thrombosis of the main arteries of the anterior circle of Willis.
