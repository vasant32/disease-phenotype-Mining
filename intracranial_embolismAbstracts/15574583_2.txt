A 54-year-old woman presented for cardiac evaluation of atypical chest pain. Workup included coronary angiography and a left ventriculogram, during which air was inadvertently injected, resulting in the development of an acute right hemisphere syndrome. Right carotid angiography was immediately performed, yielding only a delayed diffuse venous phase without focal vessel cutoffs. Within 60 minutes, the patient underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the suspected cerebral air emboli. After removal from the chamber for technical reasons, she had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and further hyperbaric oxygen therapy was withheld. Initial computed tomography imaging obtained approximately 8 hours after symptom onset showed signs of early right hemispheric edema. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging studies were markedly abnormal and suggestive of diffuse bilateral but predominantly right-sided parietal lobe edema with mildly positive diffusion-weighted imaging. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months was normal, and the patient's neurological examination returned to normal.
