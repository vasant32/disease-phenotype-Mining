Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a presentation of an occult malignancy. The clinical, laboratory and postmortem findings of a 44-year-old man with osteopetrosis and NBTE are reported. A small apical bronchogenic carcinoma was found on postmortem examination. A thorough search for malignancy should be made in patients with unexplained cerebral emboli, especially if hematologic abnormalities are present. There is presently no evidence that anticoagulation or other treatment is beneficial.
