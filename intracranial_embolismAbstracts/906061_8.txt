Two hundred and thirty-one patients with cerebrovascular disease were examined by spectrophotometry of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and by computer tomography. Many were followed by repeated examinations. Specific diagnoses --- bleeding as opposed to non-hemorrhagic or hemorrhagic infactions --- were indicated in 97% by spectrophotometry and in 65% by CT scan in 201 of the 231 cases (excluding 25 patients with transient ischemic attacks and five patients with cerebral tumors with cerebrovascular onset). Comparison between the two methods revealed agreement in most cases, with disagreement in only a few. The specific diagnosis was generally established on only one examination by both methods: repeated examinations were necessary in only a few cases. The results indicated that a combination of the two complementary methods established the diagnosis in almost all cerebrovascular disorders. This was particularly evident if the examinations were performed 24 hours to 21 days after onset of disease.
