Two patients with cerebral venous thrombosis are described. In both patients laboratory findings suggested an underlying haematological disorder and bone marrow biopsy showed a myeloproliferative disorder. Both chronic cerebral venous thrombosis and early myeloproliferative disorders are difficult to diagnose. Their combined occurrence may be less rare than is frequently supposed.
