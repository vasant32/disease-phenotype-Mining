Subclavian artery occlusive disease is usually secondary to persistent compression caused by thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) and rarely due to focal atherosclerosis. Emboli from diseased vessel can flow retrograde to the vertebral or carotid arteries to produce ischemic infarct with or without neurological deficit. We are reporting two cases of distal subclavian artery disease presenting with cerebral embolization, an unusual manifestation. Such surgically correctable lesions producing cerebral emboli and stroke needs consideration while evaluating patients with unusual presentation to prevent further occurrence of stroke.
