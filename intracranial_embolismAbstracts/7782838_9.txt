Multiple aneurysm formation secondary to an embolism from the cardiac myxoma is a well-known phenomenon. The cerebral arterial aneurysm formation process involved remains to be elucidated, although occupation of the arterial wall by tumor cells has been proven histologically. The authors present the case of a patient in whom tumor cells in the aneurysm wall were demonstrated and penetration of viable myxoma cells into the wall was also observed 19 months after surgical removal of the cardiac tumor. Such findings have never before been verified histologically. In light of the histological findings, the authors discuss the therapeutic problems associated with cerebral aneurysms resulting from cardiac myxoma.
