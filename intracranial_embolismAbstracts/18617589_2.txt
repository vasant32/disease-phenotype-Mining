Major neurologic morbidity and mortality with vertebroplasty are rare. We describe a 71-year-old woman who had a stroke approximately 30 minutes after vertebroplasty. Imaging revealed that bone cement had embolized to the left middle cerebral artery. Emergency embolectomy was attempted but was unsuccessful. This report emphasizes the need to be aware that intracranial embolization of polymethylmethacrylate can occur and describes management strategies to consider.
