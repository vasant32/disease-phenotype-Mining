Sixty-five cases of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) were discovered at autopsy during a 10 year period--an incidence of 1.6 per cent in the adult autopsy population. In 51 cases, one or more malignant neoplasms were associated; adenocarcinoma represented the most frequent histologic type of related neoplasm. Coagulation abnormalities suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were present in 18.5 per cent of the cases. It is possible that both the valvular and peripheral intravascular thromboses in at least some cases of NBTE represent the abnormal coagulation of DIC. Arterial thrombosis with infarction occurred in many peripheral organs. Splenic and renal were most frequent, but cerebral and cardiac consequences were the most significant.
