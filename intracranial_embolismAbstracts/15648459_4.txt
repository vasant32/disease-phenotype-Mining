We report two cases of bilateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory infarction. On magnetic resonance (MR) angiograms, the A1 segment of the ACA was unilaterally hypoplastic in both cases, suggesting that unilateral hypoplasia of A1 is a significant predisposing factor for this rare type of cerebral infarction. When the contralateral A1 is dominant, embolic materials may enter into it more easily.
