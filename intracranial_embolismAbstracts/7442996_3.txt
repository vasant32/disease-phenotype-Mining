The case of a patient who suffered a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) associated with normal angiography is reported. Three weeks later he developed an embolic stroke secondary to a nonhemolytic Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis of the mitral valve; thus, the SAH was the initial manifestation of bacterial endocarditis. Bacterial endocarditis should be considered a possible cause of SAH, especially in the 7% of patients with angiographically negative SAH.
