Cerebral venous thrombosis is difficult to diagnose clinically. Often, the presence of this disorder is not suspected, and, when it is, proof of its existence has in the past required cerebral angiography. The authors present a case of cerebral venous thrombosis diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Complete resolution of the thrombus was also documented by MRI. To the authors' knowledge, the latter use of MRI has never been reported before. Previous cases of cerebral venous thrombosis are also reviewed. The authors believe that MRI probably will become the test of choice in the diagnosis of this disorder.
