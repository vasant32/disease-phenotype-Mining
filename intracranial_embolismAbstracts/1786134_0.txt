Ligation of the carotid artery remains an accepted treatment for unclippable giant carotid artery aneurysms. Post-operative evaluation is commonly made subsequently by CT scan and angiography, the latter involving an invasive procedure. This paper describes the magnetic resonance (MR) appearance of a traumatic giant terminal carotid artery aneurysm treated by common carotid ligation. MR appears to be the imaging technique of choice for follow-up of giant aneurysms of the terminal carotid artery treated by carotid ligation, the accuracy of delineation of the aneurysm and its content surpassing that of the CT scan.
