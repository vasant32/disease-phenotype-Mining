A CT-guided needle lung biopsy carries a risk of potential air embolization. We present a rare case of air embolization after this procedure. Postmortem CT revealed air in the cerebral arteries and the left ventricle. This complication is extremely rare; however, it becomes fatal when it happens. Several points to prevent this fatal complication are discussed.
