Pure mitral insufficiency associated with secundum atrial septal defect is not an unusual finding. Thirteen patients with significant mitral insufficiency and an associated secundum defect were operated upon. Two of these patients also had severe tricuspid insufficiency. The mitral valve was repaired in 12 patients and replaced in one. The tricuspid valve was reapired in the two patients with associated tricuspid insufficiency. There were two early deaths due to mediastinitis and one late death due to a cerebral embolus in the only patient who had valve replacement; this patient died 3 years after the operation. It is concluded that mitral and tricuspid valve repair should be performed for patients with significant mitral and tricuspid insufficiency associated with atrial septal defect of the secundum variety. Replacement of the values should be avoided if possible.
