The authors report a case of right auricular and left intraventricular double thrombus involving the tricuspid valve, diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography. This double thrombus developed in a male of 54 years presenting dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure who was admitted as an emergency case due to cerebral embolism. Surgery and fibrinolytic agents were contraindicated and heparin treatment was initiated. The right auricular mass subsided in 24 hours without symptomatology. Only venous pulmonary digitalized angiography showed a moderate defect. Bearing in mind literature reports, the present observation is particularly interesting on three counts: simultaneous double localization, the fortuitous detection of a right auricular clot before development of pulmonary embolism and the rapid subsidence of the thrombus under heparin treatment as wall as the satisfactory progress without symptomatology of pulmonary embolism.
