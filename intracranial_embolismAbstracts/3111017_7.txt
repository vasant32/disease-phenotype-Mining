Lupus anticoagulants are circulating autoantibodies, primarily directed against phospholipids, that prolong the partial thromboplastin time. They have been previously associated with systemic arterial and venous thrombosis and arterial stroke, but not with cerebral venous thrombosis. We describe 2 young patients with cerebral venous thrombosis documented by intravenous digital subtraction angiography in whom a lupus anticoagulant was demonstrated. Both patients improved with corticosteroid and anticoagulant therapy.
