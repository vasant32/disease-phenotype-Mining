Acute bacterial endocarditis developed in a 65-year-old man two years after surgical resection of a false aneurysm of the left ventricle. The patient had cerebral embolic manifestations, and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from each of six blood samples. A pericardial friction rub and a changing pansystolic murmur appeared during the third week of hospitalization. The presence of a false aneurysm was once again demonstrated on ventriculographic studies. This was successfully repaired, employing cardiopulmonary bypass. The sequence of events in this patient suggests that bacterial endocarditis at the site of a previous cardiomyotomy might have led to the development of the second pseudo-aneurysm.
