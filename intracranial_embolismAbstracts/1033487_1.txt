The patient reported here had a bilateral inferior altitudinal hemianopia from lesions of the calcarine (striate) cortex of the occipital lobes. The only significant pathologic findings were bilateral calcarine artery occlusive disease, with infarcts of the striate cortex on both sides. The ages of the infarcts appeared compatible with the clinical development of the respective visual field defects. The rest of the visual system was anatomically intact.
