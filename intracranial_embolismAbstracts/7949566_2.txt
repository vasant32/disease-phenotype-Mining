A 77-year-old man underwent coronary artery angiography quite well. However, several attempts were required to pass the pigtail catheter across a calcified stenotic aortic valve. On return to the floor, motor aphasia and right hemiparesis developed and improved steadily within a few days. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a calcific density in the left middle cerebral artery. The authors believe the calcific plaque originated from the calcified aorta and aortic valve. The patient was discharged within 48 hours with minimal neurological signs. Spontaneous calcified emboli to cranial vessels from calcific aortic stenosis or other sources are rare. CT detection of a calcific plaque in a cranial vessel following coronary vessel catheterization is well documented in this patient.
