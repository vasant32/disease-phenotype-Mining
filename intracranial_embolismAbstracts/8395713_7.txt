In patients with chronic nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, prophylaxis of peripheral arterial embolism is strongly indicated. LMWHs may be an alternative regimen if contraindications for oral anticoagulants are present. In the present study the effect of LMWH on the incidence of embolism in atrial fibrillation has been studied in 75 consecutive patients in comparison to no specific treatment. Patients received one daily injection of the LMWH CY 216 (n = 35) subcutaneously over a period of 6 months. Patients of the control group (n = 40) were observed over the same period of time. In the group treated with CY 216, three embolic events (8.6%) occurred, of which two were localized in the cerebrum. One of these two cerebral embolic events was fatal. In the control group, eight embolic events (20%) occurred, six of these were intracerebral and, of these, five were fatal. An even more pronounced difference between the groups was observed on evaluation of the patients with preceding cerebral embolism. Of 15 patients treated with LMWH, one extracerebral nonfatal embolism occurred. In the control group three of the seven patients (43%) experienced fatal reembolism. The results show that in patients with atrial fibrillation one daily subcutaneous injection of LMWH reduces the incidence of arterial embolism to about one third. No adverse effects were observed during the 6-month treatment period with LMWH.
