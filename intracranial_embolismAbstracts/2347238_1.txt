Right-sided valvular (tricuspid, pulmonic) endocarditis is frequently complicated by septic pulmonary embolization. Systemic embolization may also rarely occur due to associated left-sided endocarditis or right-to-left shunting in patients with septal defects. This report documents the occurrence of systemic embolization causing a cerebrovascular accident in an intravenous drug abuser with recurrent tricuspid valve endocarditis due to an isolated peripheral septic pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. Noninvasive diagnosis of the fistula by cardiac auscultation, contrast echocardiography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging was confirmed by selective pulmonary angiography. Subselective balloon embolization of the pulmonary arteries feeding this fistula was accomplished.
