A 16-year-old girl presented with multiple cerebral cavernous angiomas with calcifications due to repeated hemorrhages and a thrombosed cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Her 18-year-old elder sister also had multiple cerebral cavernous angiomas associated with calcifications, which suggested presence of repeated previous hemorrhages. Surgical removal via a right occipital craniotomy resulted in a good outcome. The histological diagnosis was thrombosed AVM. Evaluation of congenital vascular anomaly needs to take into consideration the combination of other congenital vascular anomalies and their familial occurrence.
