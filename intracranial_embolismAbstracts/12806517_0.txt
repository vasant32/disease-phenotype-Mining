OBJECTIVE: To describe the cerebral protection technique used in the angioplasty and stenting to treat stenotic lesions of carotid artery bifurcation, showing its efficiency in avoiding cerebral emboli during the procedure. METHOD: Forty two patients (47 arteries) were treated with the cerebral protection technique, which consists in the temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery, above the stenotic lesion, performing the aspiration and flushing of glucose solution into the internal carotid artery after the delivery of the stent and the angioplasty, to remove any atherosclerotic plaque's fragments. RESULTS: The angioplasty was efficient in all cases. There were no cerebral emboli in the patients in whom the complete cerebral protection technique was used, showing its efficiency. Distal embolism occurred in one patient, during pre angioplasty and before the use of cerebral protection. CONCLUSION: The cerebral protection technique was efficient to avoid cerebral emboli in the procedures performed. This data is in agreement with the literature and the use of this technique increases the indications of carotid angioplasty.
