The case history is presented of a 17 year-old male admitted with right hemiplegia and motor aphasia. Static and dynamic scintigraphy allowed prediction of a giant aneurysm in the deep left frontotemporal region, and this supposition was confirmed by CT and carotid angiography. CT also revealed the aneurysm to extend farther medially than the other two examinations had indicated, the medial portion of the aneurysm being thrombosed. Evaluation of the diagnostic information obtained from the three procedures, combined with the clinical data, makes possible a reconstruction of the probable course of events. The presenting signs were probably caused by a newly formed thrombus within the aneurysm. Death, which occurred after five days, was apparently due to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
