Experimental regional cerebral ischemia was produced in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory in primates (M. mulatta) by macrosphere embolization. Determinations of percentage tissue dry weight and tissue sodium and potassium concentrations were obtained in samples from the ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres at various time from 12 to 48 hours after the onset of cerebral ischemia. Samples from the cortex normally supplied by the occluded MCA showed maximal accumulation of edema fluid with fluxes in sodium and potassium in reciprocal directions at 12 hours and similar edematous changes in putamen at 24 hours after embolization By 48 hours after MCA occlusion and despite the presence of infarction, partial reversal was observed in the redistribution of water and electrolytes in these gray matter structures. In contrast to cerebral cortex and putamen, the adjacent subcortical white matter showed progressive increases in water content from 12 to 48 hours and definite increases in tissue sodium with decreases in potassium were not observed until 48 hours after MCA occlusion. This late severe white matter edema associated with cerebral infarction appears to be a major factor responsible for the hemispheric swelling observed at this state.
