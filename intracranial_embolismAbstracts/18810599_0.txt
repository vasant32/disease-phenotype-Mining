OBJECTIVE: We have sought to relate C-reactive protein (CRP), a peripheral marker of inflammation frequently elevated in stroke patients, with aetiology and prognosis of acute cerebral infarction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were included after a first-ever CT/MR documented cerebral infarction. CRP was measured from blood samples taken within the 6th hour of the onset. Titres of C-reactive protein were stratified in quartiles. Aetiology of stroke was from TOAST criteria. Prognosis was mortality within 14 days of stroke. RESULTS: The study included 648 stroke patients. They were 335 women and 313 men, with a mean age of 70.3 years (median 72). CRP quartiles were mostly increased in cardioembolic strokes, After logistic regression analysis CRP remained an independent factor of 14-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that in the acute phase of the cerebral infarction CRP might be either a marker of cardioembolism or a predictive factor for short-term mortality.
