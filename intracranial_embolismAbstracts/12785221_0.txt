To study cerebral microembolism and focal impairment of the brain in patients with isolated and combined cardiac affection, we examined 84 patients who had survived cardioembolic stroke (CES). The examination included computed tomography of the head, echocardiography and transcranialdopplerographic monitoring of microembolic signals (MES). Group 1 consisted of 53 (63.1%) patients with one source of cardiocerebral embolism, group 2-31 (36.9%) patients with two potential causes of cardial embolic complications. In group 2 average number of documented MES (3[1;5]) and average number of cerebral ischemic foci (2[1;2]) were greater than those of group 1-2[1;4] and 1[1;1], respectively. As to the size of the lesion, it was found that small, middle-size and large foci were also visualized in group 2 more frequently. Thus, combination of two sources of cerebral embolism observed in 1/3 of CES enhances cardiogenic embologenic potential and probability of microembolism transformation into cerebral focal lesion as a result of potentiation of different ways of thrombogenesis.
