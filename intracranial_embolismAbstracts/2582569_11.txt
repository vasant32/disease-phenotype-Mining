In this report we describe a patient who developed severe headache following uneventful continuous epidural analgesia for labour and delivery. Initially it was thought that she had a spinal headache. However, with the aid of Magnetic Resonance Imaging the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis was later established. The entity of cerebral venous thrombosis, its manifestation, pathology, diagnosis and treatment are discussed.
