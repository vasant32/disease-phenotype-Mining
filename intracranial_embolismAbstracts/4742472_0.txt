Electroencephalograms were recorded in 71 stroke-free patients suffering from mitral valve disease, complicated by atrial fibrillation in 33. The incidence of EEG abnormalities was not related either to the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation or to the type of valve lesion present, and did not differ significantly from the incidence observed in the general population. The findings suggest that occurrence of symptomatically silent emboli is not a feature of rheumatic mitral valve disease.
