Technical performance, radiological findings as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic significance of superselective cerebral angiographies, performed with a telescopic catheter system, and consecutive embolizations are described in pathologic lesions in the vascular area of the human external carotid artery. In 46 patients vascular malformations (angiomas, fistulas) and vascular tumors (angiofibromas) as well as other tumors (glomus tumors, meningeomas) were demonstrated by angiographies of distal external carotid branches; in further 16 patients there were normal angiographic findings. It is shown by examples that superselective cerebral angiographies fulfill microangiographic properties. Pathological findings of vascular malformations and tumors were demonstrated which could not have been shown with other examination techniques. Besides the improved and more detailed diagnostic information these superselective angiographies of external carotid branches enabled successful embolizations of pathologic lesions by gelfoam-injections or selective occlusions of branches feeding angiomas or tumors by silicone polymerization. These embolizations were not done in patients with arterio-venous fistulas (9). The clinical application, limitations and further development of cerebral embolization techniques are discussed.
