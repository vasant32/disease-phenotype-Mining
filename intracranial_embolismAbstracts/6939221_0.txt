On autopsy of a 70-year-old hypertensive male a large arteriovenous angioma in the rostral part of the left cingular gyrus, surrounded by remains of old hemorrhages, and a multilobular saccular aneurysm at the junction of the left anterior cerebral and the communicating arteries were found. The vessels of the angioma and its feeding artery as well as the aneurysm were thrombosed. More recent thrombosis obliterated the venous drainage of the angioma and the oral part of the superior sagittal sinus. Both congenital weakness of the arterial wall and increased circulatory demand might have been responsible for this combined condition.
