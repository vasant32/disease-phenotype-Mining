To compare the percutaneous and surgical techniques of intraaortic balloon pump insertion, 101 patients referred for this procedure were randomly assigned to either percutaneous or surgical insertion. Insertion using the designated technique was successful in 45 (88%) of 51 patients with percutaneous insertion and 48 (96%) of 50 patients with surgical insertion (difference not statistically significant). The time from the beginning of the insertion procedure to the initiation of counterpulsation was 13 +/- 8 minutes for the percutaneous technique versus 31 +/- 16 minutes for the surgical technique (p less than 0.001). In the percutaneous group, 10 patients required Fogarty thrombectomy after balloon pump removal, and 1 patient developed severe leg ischemia requiring immediate termination of balloon pump support. In the surgical group, one patient developed leg ischemia requiring surgical intervention, three patients developed sepsis with bacteremia (including one patient who required vein patch repair of the femoral artery), one patient developed a wound infection requiring debridement and one patient had a cerebral embolus. Aortic dissection, aortoiliac perforation or amputation did not occur in either group. Major vascular complications occurred in 11 patients (22%) with percutaneous insertion versus 2 patients (4%) with surgical insertion (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that although the percutaneous technique for intraaortic balloon pump insertion is faster than the surgical technique and is technically easy, it is associated with a higher incidence of vascular complications.
