BACKGROUND: Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is an experimental agent used to ameliorate neutropenia in patients receiving chemotherapy. Arterial thrombotic episodes after use of IL-3 have not been reported previously. METHODS: The case of a patient with Stage III adenocarcinoma of the breast who developed hypotension and acute cerebellar artery and superior mesenteric artery thrombosis after receiving chemotherapy and treatment with IL-3 is reported. RESULTS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first patient with arterial thrombosis reported after treatment with IL-3. CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin-3 may be associated with increased propensity for thrombosis.
