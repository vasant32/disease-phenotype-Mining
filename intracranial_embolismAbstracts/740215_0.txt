The clinical and radiographic data provided by CT of 34 patients with cerebral defects acquired in early life were analyzed. Seventeen patients showed porus-like defects due to vascular thrombosis. Volume measurements were made in 26 patients to determine tissue loss and volume shifting by ROI. CT is the most effective means of detecting the cause of the lesion.
