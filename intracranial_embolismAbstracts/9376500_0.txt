Since its introduction into the clinical setting at the beginning of the 'eighties, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) has gained increasing acceptance as a non-invasive neuromonitoring technique. The ability of TCD to detect embolic particles within the cerebral blood vessels has been the subject of intensive investigation in recent years. In the present paper, a new method for the detection of emboli (multirange principle), intra-operatively during a neurosurgical intervention in a 35-year-old patient with a tumour in the posterior fossa and an open foramen ovale, is described for the first time. The method opens up new possibilities for the intra-operative management and the rapid assessment and diagnosis of paradoxical cerebral embolism.
