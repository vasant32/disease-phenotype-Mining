A 37 year-old man had headaches for 10 days, then a single tonic-clonic seizure and coma due to an extensive cerebral venous thrombosis. In spite of full-dose heparin treatment for 7 days, the clinical picture worsened along with increasing edema on CT-Scan. Direct thrombolytic treatment was then performed using transvenous catheterization and instillation of Urokinase (2.6 MU over 4 days). A near complete repermeabilization of the sinuses was obtained and the patient improved dramatically in a few days. The only adverse effect of Urokinase was hematuria. Based on our experience and review of the literature which includes 26 previous cases, direct thrombolytic therapy appears to be a relatively safe procedure. This treatment should be considered in a patient with extensive dural sinus thrombosis which fails to respond to heparin treatment.
