It is shown that the introduction of collagen into the carotid artery brings forth an increase in perfusion pressure during cat cerebral autoperfusion due to blockade of micro-vessels by platelet aggregates. This increase is of a transitory character and is accompanied by changes in the acid-base balance of the arterial blood towards acidosis. It has been established that papaverine and cavinton (vinpocetine) do not cause recanalization of the blocked microvessels, and in case of verapamil it is of a partial character. The infusion of prostacyclin brings about an almost total recanalization of microvessels and prevents intravascular aggregation upon collagen application. It is concluded that this model may prove useful in the selection of drugs for the pathological therapy of cerebral dysfunctions.
