A case of Coxsackie B5 viral myopericarditis is presented in which the diagnosis of inferolateral wall myocardial necrosis was made on the basis of specific cardiac enzyme changes and radionuclide myocardial imaging. This localized damage may have resulted from coronary arteritis with resulting infarction or necrosis secondary to preferential viral involvement of the inferolateral wall of the myocardium. Hepatitis and cerebral embolism complicated the case, with the latter suggesting endocardial disease.
