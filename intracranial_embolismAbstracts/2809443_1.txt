The investigators conducted a study of low dose aspirin and antithrombotic effectiveness in ischaemic strokes at Siriraj hospital Medical School, Mahidol University from July 1986 to June 1987. Thirty-six patients, 27 males and 9 females were enrolled in the study. The ages of the patients ranged from 33 to 80 years with a mean age of 55 +/- 12 years. Forty-seven per cent of patients had hyperfunction of platelet before treatment which fell to 3 and 0 per cent 24 hours and 7 days after low dose aspirin treatment (75 mg/d). The platelet count was significantly increased to compensate its hypofunction after seven days of treatment. There was no change in euglobulin lysis time, serotonin level in platelet after low dose aspirin treatment. Plasma prostacyclin in ischaemic stroke patients was statistically significantly reduced in comparison to normal subjects (223.8 pg/ml); but there was no further suppression of plasma prostacyclin after low dose aspirin therapy. Thus, we conclude that low dose aspirin (75 mg/d) is effective for antithrombotic effect in ischaemic stroke patients without any suppression of prostacyclin. We do recommend low dose aspirin for recurrent ischaemic stroke prophylaxis as it has fewer side effects, is cheap, easily administered and effective.
