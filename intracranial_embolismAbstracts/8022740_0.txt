Transoesophageal echocardiography has improved the detection of potential sources of cerebral embolism. We report our experience with a group of 38 patients under 45 years of age who were examined after an arterial ischaemic cerebral event. We observed 4 patients (2 males, 2 females; age 17, 24, 38 and 40 years) with an atrial septal aneurysm. Cerebral ischaemia was permanent in 3 patients and temporary in 1 and a cerebral embolism was the most probable cause based on angiographic findings. The atrial septal aneurysm was only diagnosed by transoesophageal echocardiography (type IA in case 3, IB in the others). A patent foramen ovale was observed in 3 and this abnormality, which is known to have a high prevalence in the general population, could at most be an aggravating factor. In our series, we can assume a causal association between atrial septal aneurysm and stroke in young patients (10.5% among 38 young stroke patients vs 3% of 30 patients referred for other reasons). The treatment is still under discussion although the consensus would favour surgery if another heart malformation is associated, if a visible thrombus is identified or if repeated cerebrovascular events occur despite adequate anticoagulation. Studies conducted in large series of patients should provide more adequate therapeutic schemas.
