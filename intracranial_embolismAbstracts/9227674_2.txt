BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The occurrence of microembolic signals (MES) in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke has already been described, but the diagnostic and prognostic value of this finding is still debated. METHODS: We evaluated 90 consecutive patients admitted for their first hemispheric TIA or ischemic stroke within 72 hours of onset. All of them underwent 30-minute bilateral transcranial Doppler monitoring of middle cerebral arteries, within 72 hours of onset. The monitoring was repeated after an additional 24 hours and after 7 days. We then classified the episodes in the following etiologic categories: cardioembolic, atherothrombotic, small-vessel disease, mixed cases, unknown origin, and other causes. RESULTS: We included 75 patients, with a mean interval of registration of 32.04 +/- 19.39 hours. There were 9 patients with MES (12%). All MES were recorded only on the symptomatic middle cerebral artery, and the majority were recorded during the first or the second registration. No statistically significant difference was found in risk factors and hematologic parameters. Five patients (56%) had atherothrombotic episodes, 3 patients (33%) had cardioembolic episodes, and 1 patient (11%) had a protein S deficit. No patient with MES had small-vessel disease (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: MES are an infrequent finding in patients with TIA or ischemic stroke within 72 hours of onset, but they can be recorded more easily with serial registration. In our patients, MES were found only on the symptomatic middle cerebral artery and were present in atherothrombotic and cardioembolic episodes but not in small-vessel disease.
