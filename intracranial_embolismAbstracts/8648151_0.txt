Serum lipid profile is, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides and serum cardiac enzymes ie, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), creatinine phosphokinase isoenzyme MB (CPK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) levels were estimated in 50 cases of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) consisting of 26 cases of cerebral haemorrhage and 24 cases of cerebral thrombosis. All analyses were made on day 1 and day 7. Serum cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides levels were significantly higher in CVA patients on day 1. Lipid level fell significantly on day 7 in respect to day 1. On comparing the lipid levels between cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral thrombosis, no significant difference was observed. Cardiac enzymes like CPK and CPK-MB were significantly raised whereas, AST/SGOT and LDH were marginally raised on day 1 in CVA patients. However, there was no change in cardiac enzyme levels between cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral thrombosis patients.
