Although sympathetic stressors can trigger acute coronary events, the growth of coronary thrombosis depends on hypercoagulable conditions.  Psychological stress and catecholamine surge may affect regular hemostatic activity.  We investigated the effects of standardized mental stress in a group of elderly subjects on markers of a hypercoagulable state&#x2014;thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and fibrin D-dimer (DD)&#x2014;and on the von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker of endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular disorders.  To verify that the stressor provoked sympathetic activation, we also measured hemodynamics and plasma catecholamines.
