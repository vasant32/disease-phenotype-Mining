INTRODUCTION: Treatment of acute ischemic stroke with systemic thrombolysis in the presence of a proximal thrombo-embolic source carries a theoretical risk of thrombus fragmentation and recurrent embolization. Intracardiac thrombus has received the most attention as a potential source of recurrent emboli, and in the past, it was considered a relative contra-indication to tissue plaminogen activator (t-PA) treatment. More recent data show that recurrent embolization from a cardiac source during t-PA infusion is rare. CASE REPORT: This article describes recurrent symptomatic basilar artery embolization during t-PA infusion from acute thrombus in the proximal cervical vertebral artery. DISCUSSION: This case provides evidence that intravenous t-PA must be used cautiously in the presence of large proximal thrombo-embolic sources and that intraluminal thrombus in a large cervical artery should be considered one such source.
