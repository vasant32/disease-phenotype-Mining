Zinc is prevalent in the mammalian central nervous system and its role in ischemic brain injury is still controversial. In the present study, the effect of zinc in ischemic brain injury was examined in an embolic model of stroke in rats. Furthermore, the effect of zinc in combination with bicuculline, a GABAa antagonist, was also examined in the ischemic injury. Treatment with zinc or zinc plus bicuculline increased infarct volume significantly and also worsened neurological deficits. Moreover, treatment with zinc plus bicuculline also enhanced ischemic brain edema. These results thus support the hypothesis that administration of zinc i.p. worsens the outcome of ischemic brain injury in the embolic model of stroke in rats.
