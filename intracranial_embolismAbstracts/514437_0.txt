During 1973 and 1974 in the urban population of Kielce 528 verified new cases of cerebro-vascular disorders (CVD) were found. The average annual incidence rates reached 203 for males, 176--for females, and 189 for both sexes per (100,000) 181, 167 and 174 respectively when cases of transient ischaemic attack were excluded. The mortality rates in those cases were estimated to be 103, 82 and 92 respectively. Nearly 70 percent of all cases were admitted to neurological departments, and 14 percent remained at home. Age-adjusted incidence rates for subarachnoidal haemorrhage and cerebral embolism were three times higher, and the total incidence rate--twice higher than the rates estimated previously for the Warsaw population. It can be concluded that the incidence rates for CVD based exclusively on data from neurological departments are underestimated by at least 30 percent, and this bias varies according to the type of CVD. Prospective studies aimed toward evaluation of factors which can influence risk of development or death of CVD should be initiated.
