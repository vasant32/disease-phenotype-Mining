A case of rapid neurological deterioration in a 60-year-old man with oesophageal carcinoma is reported. He suffered two episodes of global cerebral dysfunction following traumatic endoscopic manipulation. Autopsy findings showed multiple tumour emboli which occluded medium and small-sized vessels in cortical and subcortical areas, resulting in multiple microinfarcts.
