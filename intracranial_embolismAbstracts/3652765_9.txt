Percutaneous thin needle biopsy, a widely used method for diagnosis of lung conditions, is generally safe and effective. A near-fatal air embolism is reported that occurred during percutaneous thin needle aspiration biopsy of the lung. Successful treatment was accomplished by hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Physicians should be aware of this possible complication and identify the location of the nearest chamber for possible transfer.
