Recent studies suggest that high plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and its inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PAI-1) are markers of an increased risk of atherothrombotic ischemic events such as stroke and myocardial infarction. In this prospective study, we measured tPA antigen, PAI-1 antigen and activity, as well as tPA/PAI-1 complex in patients with acute stroke. Stroke subtypes were classified according to the TOAST criteria. From 132 consecutively screened patients, 89 (100%) were enrolled in this study, including 42 patients (47%) with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), 32 (36%) with small vessel occlusion (SVO), and 15 (17%) with cardioembolism (CE). Nineteen age-matched neurologic patients without manifestations of cerebrovascular disease served as control subjects (CS). Patients with acute stroke had significantly higher plasma levels of tPA antigen (p < 0.001), PAI-1 antigen (p < 0.05) and PAI activity (p < 0.05) than patients in the control group. t-PA antigen, PAI activity and tPA/PAI-1 complex levels were similar regardless of stroke etiology. Only PAI-1 antigen was lower in patients with cardioembolic stroke than in stroke patients with LAA (p < 0.05). Plasma tPA antigen, PAI-1 antigen, and PAI activity are significantly increased in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Except for PAI-1 antigen, this increase appears not to be related to the underlying stroke etiology.
