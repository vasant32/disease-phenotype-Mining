Serum lipids and serum uric acid have been studied in 50 patients with ischemic thrombotic cerebrovascular disease. Patients having diseases known to predispose to hyperuricemia were excluded. Abnormalities of large vessels were present in 14 or 30 cases (46.6%) as a whole, and in 9 of 16 cases (56.5%) below 40 years of age. Thirty percent of the cases showed hyperuricemia. A statistically significant rise in serum triglycerides, pre-beta lipoproteins and serum uric acid was found in all 50 patients and in patients below 40 years of age. In patients above 40 years of age, only the rise in serum triglycerides and pre-beta lipoproteins was found to be statistically significant. A statistically significant rise in serum triglycerides, pre-beta lipoproteins, cholesterols and uric acid was found in patients with abnormal angiograms. A statistically significant correlation was observed between serum uric acid and serum triglycerides in all the groups, between serum uric acid and pre-beta lipoprotein in patients below 40 years of age, and between serum uric acid and serum phospholipids in patients with abnormal angiograms. These factors may be playing a role in the causation of ischemic thrombotic cerebrovascular disease in general and especially in patients below 40 years of age.
