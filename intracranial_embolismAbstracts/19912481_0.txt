 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Single gate transcranial Doppler spectrogram (sgTCD) has a high variability in the detection of microembolic signals (MES), Adding Power M-mode Doppler (PMD) information may improve MES detection. Our study's aim is to derive combined PMD/sgTCD microemboli criteria to overcome this limitation. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic carotid disease were prospectively enrolled within 24 h of symptom onset underwent 1 hour TCD emboli monitoring. We reviewed disparity between PMD MES criteria and sgTCD MES criteria. We compared combined PMD/sgTCD criteria to sgTCD alone criteria by measuring the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Of 92 patients, 28 patients had evidence of MES on sgTCD or PMD. Total MES count was 269 based on sgTCD criteria, and 326 based on combined PMD/sgTCD criteria (P= 0.005). Combined PMD/sgTCD criteria revealed 17 MESs (4.8%) based on sgTCD criteria to represent artifacts and 57 MESs (17.5%) not to be detected by sgTCD criteria. Overall ICC based on sgTCD criteria was 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58-0.74]; however, introducing combined PMD/sgTCD criteria resulted in a significant increase in the ICC, 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93). CONCLUSION: Our combined PMD/sgTCD criteria for MES appeared to improve the yield of MES detection. Reliability in MES detection interpretation was improved when combined PMD/sgTCD criteria was applied.
