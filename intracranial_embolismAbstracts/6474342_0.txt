A technically adequate four-vessel cerebral angiogram was normal on the first day after a typical episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The study was repeated 40 days later showing a large aneurysm of the basilar bifurcation. Hypothetically, the first attempt to visualize the aneurysm was negative due to early transitory thrombosis of the aneurysmal sac. In some cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage it is beneficial to repeat previously normal angiographic studies.
