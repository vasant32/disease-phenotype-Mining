OBJECTIVES: The effects of pentasaccharide (PENTA), given alone or combined with thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), on infarct size and clinical outcome were evaluated in a rat embolic stroke model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-two rats were embolized unilaterally and assigned to: (i). controls, (ii). rt-PA 6 mg/kg, (iii). PENTA 0.5 mg/kg, (iv). PENTA 0.5 mg/kg and rt-PA 6 mg/kg. After 2 days animals were killed, the brains removed and evaluated microscopically. RESULTS: The median infarct size measured in percentage of the affected hemisphere was 25% in the control group, 4% (P < 0.01, Mann Whitney) in group 2, 19% (n.s.) in group 3, and 10% (P < 0.05) in group 4. rt-PA, and rt-PA combined with PENTA also promoted functional recovery. CONCLUSION: The present study found no effect of 0.5 mg/kg PENTA treatment. Compared with rt-PA treatment alone, 0.5 mg/kg PENTA alone or combined with rt-PA did not significantly increase mortality or tendency for hemorrhage.
