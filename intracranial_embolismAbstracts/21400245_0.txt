Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) associated with antiproteinase-3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (PR3-ANCA) has previously been reported in 10 cases of Streptococcus viridans and in 1 case of Escherichia faecalis infection. Most of these patients had hypocomplementemia and were positive for several autoantibodies. The infections in most of these patients showed good responses to antibiotic treatment. We report three patients with ANCA-positive SBE, which was induced by attenuated slow-growing intracellular pathogens; these patients had severe complications, such as acute kidney injury, cerebral embolism, and aortic valve destruction.
