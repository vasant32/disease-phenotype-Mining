Successful direct revascularization in a 54-year-old man with embolism of the basilar artery following St Jude Medical valve replacement for mitral regurgitation 6 years earlier is reported. He arrived at the hospital in a deep coma. Computed tomography showed no new lesions, but subsequent angiography revealed occlusion of the basilar tip, bilateral posterior cerebral arteries and right superior cerebellar artery. Direct thrombolytic therapy was performed using 420,000 units urokinase through an infusion catheter placed in the basilar artery. The patient immediately regained consciousness, with only slight diplopia. Direct thrombolytic therapy is considered to be an effective treatment for thromboembolism following prosthetic valve replacement in certain selected cases.
