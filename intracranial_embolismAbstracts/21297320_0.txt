 OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with the functional outcomes of patients with cerebral embolism due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the short-term functional outcomes of 134 patients diagnosed with cardiogenic cerebral embolism due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation during the period of May 2006 to August 2008. Functional state was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) on admission and at discharge. RESULTS: A good functional outcome (mRS â‰¤2) at discharge was significantly associated with low mRS on admission (OR: 0.07; CI: 0.03-0.18; p<0.001), and a low C-reactive protein (CRP) level (OR: 0.19; CI: 0.04-0.89; p<0.05). Functional improvement during admission was positively associated with the presence of dyslipidemia (OR: 2.74; CI: 1.11-6.76; p<0.05), whereas high diastolic blood pressure (OR: 0.95; CI: 0.90-0.99; p<0.05) and a high blood sugar level (OR: 0.98; CI: 0.97-0.99; p<0.05) on admission were inversely associated with functional improvement. Furthermore, no relationship existed between mRS on admission and functional improvement during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a good functional state at discharge was associated with a good functional state on admission as well as a low serum CRP level. On the other hand, functional improvement was associated with the presence of dyslipidemia, low diastolic blood pressure, and low blood sugar level on admission.
