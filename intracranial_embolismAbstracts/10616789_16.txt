With use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the effects of early and delayed treatment of embolic stroke in rat with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) were investigated. Rats with embolic stroke were treated with rt-PA at 1 (n = 9) or 4 (n = 7) hours after stroke onset or were untreated (n = 15). Diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and T2-weighted imaging were performed before and after embolization from 1 hour to 7 days. No significant differences were detected in the relative areas with low cerebral blood flow (CBF), apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw), and T2 between the 4-hour treated group and the untreated group. Significant decreases in the average relative areas with low CBF were detected in the 1-hour treated group from 4 to 48 hours after embolization as compared with the untreated group. The increase in T2 in the 1-hour treated group was significantly lower than in the untreated and 4-hour treated groups. A significant increase in ADCw was detected in the 1-hour treated group at 3 and 24 hours after embolization as compared with the untreated and 4-hour treated groups. Secondary embolization was detected by both MRI and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The data suggest that MRI can detect the efficacy of rt-PA treatment and secondary ischemic damage.
