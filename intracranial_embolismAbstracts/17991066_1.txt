Computed tomography scan findings are described in cerebral arterial gas embolism in two patients with right to left intracardiac shunts by accidental injection of air during intravenous therapy. Although imaging may not be necessary to diagnose the condition, the patient may be referred to CT scan as a case of stroke. Cerebral arterial gas embolism should be considered in the differential diagnosis of stroke, particularly in case of right-to-left shunts. CT findings described are classical and diagnostic of the condition.
