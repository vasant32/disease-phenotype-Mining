The role of computerized transaxial tomography (CTT) of the brain in 100 post-operative tumor cases is assessed. CTT proves an accurate method of determining tumor recurrence and in evaluating such complications as intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural or extradural hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, hydrocephalus and shunt patency. Its accuracy decreases the need for interventional procedures. Its usefulness may be limited by the presence of metal clips or plates, by radio-opaque contrast media or intracranial air.
