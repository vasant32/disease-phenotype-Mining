A 3-year-old child died following a routine tetralogy of Fallot repair. Death was caused by a cerebral embolus. Injury to the left ventricle during left ventricular venting resulted in an apical myocardial infarct. The embolic source was a mural thrombus covering the area of infarction. A technique is described whereby left ventricular venting can be avoided during open-heart surgery in small patients.
