A 66-year-old man was implanted with a pacemaker. Seven years after implantation he was admitted due to cardiogenic cerebral embolism and warfarin therapy was introduced. After that, he suffered recurrent pericardial effusion for unexplained reasons. An exploratory thoracotomy revealed that the screw of the atrial lead had penetrated through the right auricular appendage wall.
