AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of valve-related complications in patients with a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis and to identify risk factors for an adverse outcome. METHODS ANd RESULTS: In the 424 patients, event-free survival rates 5 and 10 years after aortic valve replacement were 62% and 37%, respectively. The linearized incidence of thromboembolic events was 4.4% per patient-year, and of anticoagulant-related haemorrhage 8.5% per patient-year. Advanced NYHA functional class, atrial fibrillation, pure aortic regurgitation and thromboembolism prior to surgery decreased event-free survival. A history of pre-operative thromboembolism increased the risk for a first embolic event after aortic valve replacement (relative hazard [RH] 3.2), but was even more strongly associated with the risk for repeated events (> or =2 events, RH 5.4). After each thromboembolic episode that occurred, the risk for a subsequent one was increased. The risk for at least one, and up to three or more haemorrhages was increased in patients with a pre-operative history of bleeding (RH 3.3-5.1) and of atrial fibrillation (RH 1.8-3.9). The risk for a subsequent event was increased by a history of repeated haemorrhages, a short interval since previous bleeding, and high age. CONCLUSIONS: There were few factors strongly related to valve related morbidity. However, previous bleedings and previous thromboembolism were powerful risk factors for repeated events.
