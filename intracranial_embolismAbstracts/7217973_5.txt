The clinical features in a 42 year old man with malignant atrophic papulosis with CNS involvement are described. They included mental dysfunction, paraesthesiae, weakness of left limbs, with pyramidal tract signs, bilateral ptosis, progressing to total ophthalmoplegia and obtundation. There were two crops of characteristic papular lesions on trunk and limbs, with terminal evidence of a coagulopathy and bruises, resulting in death in six months. Papular biopsy revealed multiple microinfarcts in the dermal collagen. The brain showed multiple small haemorrhagic infarcts of both hemispheres, the lower mid-brain, pons and a cerebellar peduncle. Microscopy showed fibrin exudation in the leptomeninges, various stages of thrombosis of small arteries without inflammatory reaction, and corresponding acute and subacute microinfarcts. The pathogenetic basis of the disease appeared to be a combined vasculopathy and coagulopathy.
