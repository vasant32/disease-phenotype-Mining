75 patients with atherosclerosis divided into five disease groups (previous myocardial infarction and cerebral thrombosis, angina pectoris, transient ischemic attacks, arteriosclerosis obliterans) were studied and compared to 20 healthy subjects. Antithrombin III (AT III) concentration was determined by single radial immunodiffusion; AT III and factor Xa-inhibitor (Xa-I) activities were measured by amidolytic methods. No significant difference was found in any group of patients as compared to normal controls by all the methods. A positive correlation was found between AT III concentration and AT III activity, AT III concentration and Xa-I activity, AT III activity and Xa-I activity. Results are discussed in relation to the literature data.
