We reported two young adults (a 42-year-old female and a 45-year-old male) with tension type headache who had a patent foramen ovale and atrial septal aneurysm demonstrated by transesophageal echocardiography, associated with asymptomatic cerebral infarctions. There were multiple subcortical infarctions in the frontal and parietal lobes in case 1, and cerebral infarctions in the right corona radiata, head and body of the caudate nucleus, and putamen in case 2. The two cases did not have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cardiac diseases detected by electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography, and abnormality of intracranial and extracranial arteries by ultrasound sonography and cerebral angiography. Transeosophageal echocardiography revealed atrial septal aneurysm, and showed right-to-left shunt (patent foramen ovale) by Valsalva maneuver. Two cases were diagnosed as paradoxical cerebral embolism associated with a patent foramen ovale. If asymptomatic cerebral infarctions are cryptogenic stroke, a patent foramen ovale and atrial septal aneurysm should be examined by transesophageal echocardiography with Valsalva maneuver.
