Summary: We describe a rare case of having both symptomatic ipsilateral retinal embolization and asymptomatic cerebellar embolization occurring after carotid stenting with use of distal protect device. In this case, external carotid angiograms revealed accessory meningeal arteryophthalmic artery and occipital artery-vertebral artery anastomoses. This case suggested that the protection for external carotid artery should be considered during carotid stenting to avoid retinal embolization and cerebellar or cerebral embolization in cases showing angiographical anastomoses between external carotid artery and ophthalmic artery or intracranial arteries.
