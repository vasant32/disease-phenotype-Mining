Using psychological methods memory and attention were examined in a control group (normal subjects) and in patients at the early rehabilitation period following reconstructive surgery on cerebral vessels before and after therapy with oxygen baths. The psychological methods of examination were found to be valuable in terms of both diagnosis and assessment of the time-course of the studied parameters at various stages of the treatment. The use of oxygen baths was shown to be effective in disorders of memory and attention.
