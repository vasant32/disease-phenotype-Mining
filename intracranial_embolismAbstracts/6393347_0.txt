During a two-year period, intra-operative ultrasonic explorations were performed in 44 patients for the purpose of localisation of intracranial masses. This facilitated accurate intraoperative assessment of the location and consistency of the mass. We consider operative ultrasound to be an invaluable adjunct to surgery of small intracerebral masses.
