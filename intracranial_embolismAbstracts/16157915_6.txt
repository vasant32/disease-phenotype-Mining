Cerebrovascular disease occurs in HIV-positive individuals, but no relationship between the two has been established. The authors reviewed a cohort of patients aged 15 to 44 years to evaluate stroke in HIV-positive and negative subjects. Patients who were HIV-positive with no other identifiable etiology were compared to age- and race-matched HIV-negative patients. HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups did not differ in angiographic, cardiac, or serologic tests. A positive HIV test does not provide causal information or diagnosis.
