A 47-year-old male presented with frequent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) of weakness of the left upper extremity. Computed tomography demonstrated multiple infarcts in the right cerebral hemisphere. Cerebral angiography showed marked atheromatous changes at the siphon of the right internal carotid artery, characterized by wall irregularities and heterogeneous filling. Indium-111-labeled platelet scintigraphy demonstrated abnormal tracer accumulation at the right carotid siphon. Following right carotid artery ligation, this abnormal platelet deposition was resolved and no further TIA was experienced. This suggests that the release of microthrombi from thrombogenic carotid atheroma contributes to embolic stroke.
