We report a case of cerebral embolization of an arteriovenous malformation in the temporal lobe after partial neurosurgical resection. The lesion consisted of two compartments of which only the lateral part with combined large hematoma was resected. The medial compartment was treated by superselective embolization using a microcatheter and polyvinyl alcohol particles. Because of his psychiatric condition, general anaesthesia was used in this young male.
