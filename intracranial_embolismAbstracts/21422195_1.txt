We report three cases of stroke in association with peripheral venous interventions that each included foam ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy (UGS). All three female patients experienced a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke causing dysphasia and left hemiparesis. A patent foramen ovale was found in each patient. The first incident occurred two days after foam UGS to treat small tributaries of a great saphenous vein (GSV). Paradoxical clot embolism was presumed in this case where concurrent deep vein thrombosis with non-occlusive thrombus in a medial gastrocnemius vein extending to the popliteal vein was detected on ultrasound. The second case occurred immediately at the completion of foam UGS and ambulatory phlebectomy to treat GSV tributaries. Paradoxical gas embolism was demonstrated in this patient confirmed by visualization of bubbles in the right MCA on CT angiography. The third case occurred one day after endovenous laser ablation (1470 nm) and foam UGS to treat both great and small saphenous veins. No specific cause could be confirmed in this patient. Sodium tetradecyl sulphate foam was used in all three cases (3%, 16 mL; 1.5%, 4 mL and 3%, 25 mL, respectively). All three patients recovered completely within a few days.
