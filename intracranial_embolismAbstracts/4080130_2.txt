A case of thrombosis of the vertebral artery and an associated bursting fracture of the lower cervical spine is reported. Computed tomography revealed both the location and the spreading of the fractures of the injured spine. We recognized that the vertebral artery thrombosis was caused by an injury to the arterial wall within the fractured transverse foramen.
