Infarction of the pons and rostral medulla secondary to arteriolar thrombosis was documented histologically in a 17-year-old mixed-Arabian female horse. Clinically, the animal experienced a sudden onset of a head tilt and subsequent non-controllable seizures. There was no historical, clinical or histological evidence to suggest the presence of infection of Equine Herpesvirus-1 or the feeding of corn contaminated by Fusarium moniliforme.
