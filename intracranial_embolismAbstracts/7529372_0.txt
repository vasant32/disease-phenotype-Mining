Six infective endocarditis patients who developed cerebral bacterial aneurysm were reviewed to clarify the indications and timing for cerebral angiography to achieve early detection of unruptured aneurysms. All cerebral bacterial aneurysms were confirmed either angiographically or at autopsy. All patients were treated conservatively. Four patients died due to ruptured aneurysm. Four of the six patients showed the signs and symptoms of cerebral and/or systemic embolism, followed by rupture or detection of cerebral bacterial aneurysm. Prodromal signs and symptoms of embolism in patients with infective endocarditis should be considered as indicators for cerebral angiography to detect cerebral bacterial aneurysms before rupture.
