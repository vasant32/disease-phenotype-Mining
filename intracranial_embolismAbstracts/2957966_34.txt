Twenty-seven patients were examined who were undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery with either a bubble oxygenator or a capillary membrane oxygenator. The latter incorporated an arterial filter and bubble trap. A noninvasive Doppler ultrasound technique is described for monitoring irregularities in the Doppler flow signals attributable to gaseous microemboli detected in the middle cerebral artery during CPB. The ultrasound index for detecting gaseous microemboli (MEI) indicated the presence of such microemboli in 22 of the 27 patients during insertion of the aortic cannula. Measurements during CPB showed the MEI ranged from 4 to 39 in the 17 patients with a bubble oxygenator. However, all 10 patients with a membrane oxygenator had an MEI of 0. Varying the gas flow rates in 3 patients with bubble oxygenators showed a change in MEI from 4 +/- 4 (SD) at a flow rate of 2 L/min to 17 +/- 9 at a flow rate of 5 L/min. This observation supports the assumption that the MEI is providing quantitative information regarding the presence of gaseous emboli in the middle cerebral artery.
