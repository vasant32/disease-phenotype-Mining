Effect of idebenone (CV-2619) on memory impairment was studied in rats with cerebral embolization. The cerebral embolization, produced by injecting 2000 microspheres into the internal carotid artery, caused a significant impairment in passive avoidance response. Repeated administrations of idebenone (30 mg/kg/day, i.p.), partially but significantly improved the impairment of the passive avoidance response in the embolized rats. The results suggest that the repeated administration of idebenone exerts an ameliorating effect on memory impairment induced by cerebral embolization.
