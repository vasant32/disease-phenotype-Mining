Several clinical cases of sinus thrombosis have been reported, but localized cerebral cortical venous thrombosis is a fairly rare clinical entity. We report a case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with right hemiparesis on admission. CT scan revealed subcortical hemorrhage with perifocal edema in the left front-parietal lobe. A T2W image revealed a large area of hyperintensity indicating edema, and coronal Gd enhanced T1 weighted image showed a reverse-triangle-shaped enhanced lesion. Left carotid angiogram showed cerebral cortical venous thrombosis in the left frontal lobe, but the superior sagittal sinus was not occluded. A month after admission, right hemiparesis had suddenly improved and the patient could walk without any support. Left carotid angiogram showed recanalization of thrombosed cortical veins and CT scan showed disappearance of any low density lesion indicative of edema. It is an important fact that neurological deficit improved quickly a month after onset, and it was suspected that, even without resorting to fibrinolytic therapy, recanalization of thrombosed cerebral veins would still eventually occur. We found the reverse-triangle-shaped enhanced lesion on MRI and we suspected that it was typical finding for cerebral cortical venous thrombosis.
