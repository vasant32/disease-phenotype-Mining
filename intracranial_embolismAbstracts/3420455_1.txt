Mercury embolization is an uncommon phenomenon that is easily diagnosed roentgenographically. We have reported a case of repeated self-administration of metallic mercury into the subcutaneous tissues. An intravenous component of the injection occurred, with systemic embolization to the lungs, CNS, pericardium, and diaphragm. These findings were demonstrated by plain films and CT, and were followed over a period of 15 months.
