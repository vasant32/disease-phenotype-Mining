The case of a young female patient with hemiplegia and aphasia of sudden onset as the initial manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus is reported. The arteriographic study showed occlusion of the proximal portion of the left anterior cerebral artery and of the trifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery. The neurological manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus may appear before there is any clinical evidence of involvement of others organs. The authors think that systemic lupus erythematosus should be suspected in every young female patient with acute cerebrovascular accident of unknown etiology.
