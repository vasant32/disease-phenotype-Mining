A brief description is given of the main clinical, histological and epidemiological circumstances of retinal vein occlusion. In an assessment of the pathogeneis of the condition, primacy is given to the role of arteriolar flow insufficiency and stress is laid on the long-standing capillaropathy which precedes the heamorrhagic phase of the disease. Basic therapeutic considerations are mentioned but stress is laid on the diagnosis of the pre-occlusive stage and on measures of a preventive nature that may be taken. Retinal vein occlusion and haemorrhagic cerebral infarct are compared with regard to their pathogenesis and the advantages are discussed of a common ophthalmoscopic study of retinal vein occlusion with neurologists interested in cerebral vascular disease leading to an interchange of therapeutic experience in both conditions. Finally, there are detailed the studies in retinal vein occlusion being conducted by the Jerusalem Institute for the Prevention of Blindness. These are studies of incidence, natural history and of pathogenesis as observed in the experimental disease produced in rhesus monkey.
