Carotid angioplasty is fast being incorporated into the treatment options for patients with carotid occlusive disease. The results of the SAPPHIRE and ARCHER trials have demonstrated that carotid angioplasty and stenting with the use of cerebral protection devices is not inferior to open surgical endarterectomy in high-risk patients. The limiting step for percutaneous carotid interventions was the potential for cerebral embolization during the intervention. However, the ready availability of several embolic protection devices has placed this technology into the hands of many endovascular specialists. A brief outline of the basic inventory necessary for a carotid stent program is presented.
