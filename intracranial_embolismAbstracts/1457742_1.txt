The pharmacological effects of a human urinary kininogenase (SK-827) on the cerebral microcirculation were studied intravital-microscopically in a rabbit with cerebral microvessel injury induced by glass bead injection into an internal carotid artery. Intravenous administration of SK-827 dilated pial arteries of the brain and increased cerebral hemoglobin content (IHb). SK-827 tended to dilate smaller arterioles more markedly than larger arterioles, and larger arterioles than small arteries. SK-827 appeared to have a vasodilating effects qualitatively different from those of nicardipine and CDP-choline. Findings obtained by concurrent hematological and biochemical examinations also suggested its beneficial effects on the function of platelets and erythrocytes.
