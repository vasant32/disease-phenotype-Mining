 BACKGROUND: In order to reduce the risk of cerebral embolism during aortic replacement through a left thoracotomy, we performed ascending or arch aortic cannulation (AAC) as well as early extracorporeal perfusion (EEP) under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). In this study we examined the effectiveness of these modifications in preventing cerebral embolism after distal arch replacement. METHODS: Between January 2006 and March 2010, 40 patients underwent distal arch replacement through a left thoracotomy, using 2 pieces of an artificial graft. In all patients, AAC, EEP, and the open technique for aortic anastomosis were performed under DHCA. The AAC resulted in the proximal aortic perfusion from the proximal site of the diseased aorta. The EEP was induced by aortic distal perfusion from the side branch of a distal graft. After completion of the proximal anastomosis under EEP and DHCA, anastomosis between the proximal and distal grafts was made during rewarming. Neurologic deficit in the brain and spinal cord, as well as early surgical results, were clinically evaluated. RESULTS: There was no permanent neurologic deficit after the surgery in the operative survivors. No patient had a stroke (0%). Temporary paraplegia and paraparesis occurred in 1 and 2 patients, respectively (7.7%); all 3 patients were able to walk prior to their discharge from hospital. Mortality in this series was 5.0% (2 of 40 patients); the cause of death was rupture of an esophageal ulcer and cardiogenic shock possibly due to myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: The AAC and EEP, in addition to deep hypothermia and DHCA, minimized the risk of cerebral embolism after distal arch aortic replacement by the left lateral approach.
