BACKGROUND: Data on the procedural safety of pulmonary vein radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) are as yet scant. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the present study were to prospectively evaluate the incidence of early complications of pulmonary vein ablation for AF in an unselected population of consecutive patients, and to identify possible predictors. METHODS: From April 2005 to October 2006, data from 1,011 consecutive patients who were undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation for every type of AF in 10 Italian centers were collected. All complications occurring from the admission of the patient up to the 30th day were considered. RESULTS: No procedure-related death was observed. Complications occurred in 40 patients (3.9%): 12 (1.2%) had peripheral vascular complications, 8 (0.8%) had conservatively treated pericardial effusion, 6 (0.6%) had cardiac tamponade (successfully drained), 5 (0.5%) had cerebral embolisms, 4 (0.4%) presented pulmonary vein stenosis >50%, and 5 (0.5%) presented other isolated adverse events. History of coronary artery disease (odds ratio 5,603, 95% confidence interval 1,559 to 20,139, P < .008) characterized patients who presented with hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION: Early complications of pulmonary vein catheter ablation seem to be fewer than in the early years of AF ablation, but still occur in 3.9% of procedures.
