INTRODUCTION: Aneurysms of the atrial septum (AAS) are uncommon. They have been considered to be related to embolic phenomena. They are usually associated with other cardiac anomalies, especially persistence of the formen ovale. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied six patients diagnosed during a period of 24 months as having ischemic ictus and AAS. They were investigated for vascular risk factors and possible causes of cardiac embolism by means of ECG, transthoracic and transoesophagic echography (ETE). Cases with the clinical characteristics of embolism were anticoagulated. RESULTS: Five patients were men with an average age of 47.6 years. Three had the clinical features of established ictus, one of RIND and two of AIT. Three patients had vascular risk factors. The TSA study showed pathology of the carotid arteries to be present in three patients. In all six cases the AAS was identified on ETE. There were no thrombi in the atria in any case, and in two there was left-right communication. In four patients the condition was considered to have a cardio-embolic origin. No patient has had further episodes of cerebral ischaemia. DISCUSSION: It seems there is a certain risk of cerebral embolus associated with AAS. The simultaneous presence of alterations in cardiac rhythm together with other structural cardiac pathology seems to have a synergic effect on this. Paradoxical embolism, arrhythmias and intra-aneurysmal thrombi appear to be the mechanisms involved in the appearance of emboli. The best therapeutic approach is still unknown. New studies are therefore necessary to establish whether or not it is necessary to anticoagulate these patients.
