We report a case of recurrent paradoxical brain embolism mediated through a small pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) with a 1.8-mm-diameter feeding artery. In this case, the further recurrent stroke was prevented successfully by PAVM embolization. Although embolization therapy is currently recommended only for PAVMs with feeding arteries greater than 3 mm in diameter, the therapy may be needed also in the smaller PAVMs.
