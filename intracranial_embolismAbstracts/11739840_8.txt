The authors describe the outcome of five patients with a cardiac thrombus selected among 183 patients with stroke (2.7 %) who were given IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). No early systemic or cerebral embolism occurred. Two patients made a complete recovery at 3 months. Two patients had a moderate outcome. One patient had late recurrent cerebral embolism and died. These data suggest that the presence of a cardiac thrombus is not associated with a high risk of recurrent embolism in patients with stroke who are given IV tPA.
