Rats submitted to focal cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery clot embolism were treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at increasing delays (1.5, 3 and 4.5 h) after the onset of ischemia. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by NMR imaging of the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC). In untreated animals the size of the ADC-detectable lesion gradually increased after clot embolism, expanding over 8 h to 174 +/- 17% of the volume visible at 30 min. Thrombolysis initiated 1.5 h after embolism did not reverse the ischemic lesion but reduced its growth to 113 +/- 19% (p < 0.05). Lesion size increased to 135 +/- 14% after 3 h (NS) and to 214 +/- 35% after 4.5 h delay (NS). Thrombolysis with rt-PA attenuates infarct expansion but does not reverse ischemic injury.
