Percutaneous transseptal mitral valvotomy was performed on 14 occasions in 13 patients; in one patient, the procedure was unsuccessful at the first attempt, but was repeated successfully. All other attempts were successful, giving a procedure success rate of 93% and a patient success rate of 100%. The only complication was transient diplopia in one patient, presumably due to a small cerebral embolus. This early experience confirms that this procedure is easily learnt, and can be performed with good results and low risk in selected patients with mitral stenosis.
