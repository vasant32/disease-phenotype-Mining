Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a well-recognized independent risk factor of ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the amount of microembolic signals (MES) in 15 patients with 'lone' AF representing the subgroup of AF patients with the lowest lifelong risk of stroke. All patients had been put on effective anticoagulation due to a scheduled electric cardioversion. Additional cardiac and arterial sources of embolism were excluded by echocardiography and extracranial color-coded duplex sonography of the carotid arteries. Unilateral one-hour transcranial Doppler monitorings revealed complete absence of MES in this series. This observation fits the concept that the amount of microembolisation is related to the risk of manifest thromboembolism. Further studies on this patient group treated with less intensive antihemostatic therapy should be undertaken to define more clearly the disease-specific microembolic activity.
