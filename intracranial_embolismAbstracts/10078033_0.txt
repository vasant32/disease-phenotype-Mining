A 17-year-old girl developed vomiting of sudden onset, followed by a state of confusion that progressed rapidly to coma within one day. Laboratory tests indicated iron deficiency anemia and reactive thrombocytosis, but there was no evidence of coagulopathy. There was no history of medication including the contraceptive pill, either. Emergency CT scan without contrast enhancement showed increased density along the course of the vein of Galen and internal cerebral veins. A repeated CT scan without contrast enhancement carried out 24 hours after the onset of the illness confirmed extensive bilateral hypodensity of the thalami, basal ganglia and adjacent white matter. There was also a prominent spontaneous increase in the density of the deep cerebral venous system. MRI was performed 3 days after the onset of the illness, which showed absence of a flow void in the region of the internal cerebral veins and septal veins on T1-weighed images. T2-weighted images showed low intensity in these veins. At autopsy, the bilateral internal cerebral veins were occluded by fresh thrombosis and hemorrhagic infarction was seen in the bilateral thalami.
