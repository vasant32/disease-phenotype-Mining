A rare but catastrophic complication of nontraumatic esophageal perforation is the formation of an esophageal-left atrial fistula. Although surgical correction of this condition should be possible, failure to recognize it antemortem has thus far prevented such intervention. A woman with long-standing severe esophagitis, was admitted with hematemesis and acute neurologic abnormalities that progressed to coma and death. A similar picture of chronic esophagitis terminating in uppergastrointestinal-tract bleeding accompanied by neurologic signs was seen in the three previously reported cases as well. Recognition of this symptom complex should permit future cases to be diagnosed clinically, and, it is hoped, corrected.
