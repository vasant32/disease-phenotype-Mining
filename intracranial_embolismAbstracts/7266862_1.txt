An aneurysm of the vein of Galen can have a varied CT appearance in infancy. The classical picture is a spherical posterior third ventricular mass with the density of circulating blood contiguous with a dilated straight sinus and with uniform contrast enhancement. With varying degrees of thrombosis of the aneurysm which may occur in late infancy, the mass can change in density and the dilated straight sinus disappear. With total thrombosis, a precontrast hyperdense rim develops with a low density. The rim enhances but the low density center does not change with contrast infusion. Our experience in three patients with this spectrum of CT findings will be demonstrated and correlated with clinical findings and angiography.
