A case of cerebral lipiodol embolism after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma is presented. A 76-year-old man underwent TACE for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Immediately after chemoembolization, his level of consciousness deteriorated. Computed tomography revealed deposition of iodized oil in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalami. Magnetic resonance imaging showed restricted diffusion within the thalami and basal ganglia. The patient's level of consciousness gradually improved, and all neurologic symptoms disappeared over 6 weeks.
