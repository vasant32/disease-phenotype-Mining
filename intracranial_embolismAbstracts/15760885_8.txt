Left atrial myxoma commonly leads to cerebral embolic ischemic stroke. The subsequent formation of cerebral aneurysms due to myxomatous emboli is a phenomenon that may lead to severe neurologic complications such as intracerebral hemorrhage. In addition to the formation of aneurysms in cerebral arteries, we report here the unique picture of a retinal involvement consisting in microaneurysm formation associated with myxomatous embolism.
