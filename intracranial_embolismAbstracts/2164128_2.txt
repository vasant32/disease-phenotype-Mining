Conventional spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of venous thrombosis is complicated by the variable appearance produced by the stage of blood clot degradation and velocity of blood flow. Phase MR imaging is a simple method based primarily on whether protons are stationary or moving. A case of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis demonstrates the utility of phase imaging.
