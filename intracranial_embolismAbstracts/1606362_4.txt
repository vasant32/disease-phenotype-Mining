Left atrial appendage aneurysm is a rare anomaly, which usually presents with arrhythmia or cerebral embolism. Diagnostic evaluation traditionally required cardiac catheterization, and surgical resection required cardiopulmonary bypass. Utilizing intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and surgical stapling devices, we have streamlined our operative technique, allowing resection of a left atrial appendage aneurysm without cardiopulmonary bypass. This report of two cases treated over the past decade demonstrates the evolution of our surgical technique.
