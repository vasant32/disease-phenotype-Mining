This study was undertaken to look for trauma-related fibrinous microthrombi in traumatized human brains. Fifty brains from patients with variable time intervals between trauma and death were fixed in 10% formaldehyde. Sections from the contusioned area and from the corresponding area of the contralateral hemisphere were embedded in paraffin and 50 non-traumatized brains were used as controls. After sectioning and embedding, 10 microns sections were stained with haemalum and eosin (HE) and phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin (PTAH). Stained fibrinous microthrombi were counted in each hemisphere and in control sections. More microthrombi could be found in the contusioned areas of the brain than in the contralateral side or in control sections.
