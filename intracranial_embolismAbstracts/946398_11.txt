Clinically important complications resulting from calcific mitral annulus fibrosus (CMAF) are unusual. They include mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and complete heart block. In one patient with massive CMAF associated with multiple systemic calcific emboli originating from the mitral valve, the emboli were the cause of multiple brain infarcts and a clinical course of unexplained neurological deterioration. We believe that this is the first report of such a complication occurring with CMAF.
