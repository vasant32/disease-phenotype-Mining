With the aid of the complex x-ray-anatomo-histomorphometric method in 130 patients who had died due to brain strokes the authors established a statistically reliable correlation between localization of occlusion (stenosis, thrombosis) from anatomical (abnormal) structure of the vessels. A conclusion is made that vessel anomalies are frequently one of the factors which cause brain strokes. They influence not only hemodynamics, but modulate distribution of occlusive process in the lumen of the vessels.
