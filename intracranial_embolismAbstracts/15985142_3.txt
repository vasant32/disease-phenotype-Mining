BACKGROUND: Patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) have an undefined but certainly considerable risk of repeated cerebral ischemia due to paradoxical embolism. Especially, if a cerebrovascular event has already occurred and the combination with an atrial septum aneurysm (ASA) is present this risk increases tremendously. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that surgical closure of PFO in combination with an ASA is safe and useful in preventing recurrent strokes. METHODS: Ten patients with previous cerebral ischemia, proven by CT or MRI, and PFO in combination with an ASA were prospectively scheduled for surgical closure. Patients with extracardiac sources of embolic disease were excluded from this study. However, one patient suffered from a hypercoagulability syndrome. RESULTS: All patients (mean age 35.5 +/- 19.1 years) underwent direct suture of the PFO and plication of the ASA with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest (n = 3) or ventricular fibrillation (n = 7). Mean operation time was 123.1 +/- 20.2 minutes; mean bypass time was 34.5 +/- 9.9 minutes. There was no mortality or significant postoperative morbidity. Mean hospital stay was 5.1 +/- 1.5 days. During a follow-up of >4 years, no recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred and no patient received anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that surgical closure of PFO in combination with ASA in patients with previous stroke is safe and efficacious to prevent recurrent strokes and avoids lifelong anticoagulation.
