A fatal case of cerebral venous thrombosis associated with protein C deficiency is reported. It occurred at six months of gestation in a 25 year old patient during her first pregnancy. She had generalized seizures. Computed axial tomography displayed cerebral haemorrhagic infarction, and the carotid angiograms signs of superior longitudinal sinus thrombosis. Before the patient's death on the seventh day after admission, protein C deficiency was discovered. The occurrence of thrombosis of the superior longitudinal sinus during pregnancy, as well as that of protein C deficiency in atypical cases of thromboembolic disease, are discussed.
