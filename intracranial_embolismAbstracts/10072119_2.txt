Thirty-seven young patients (less than 42 years of age) presenting with sudden onset of idiopathic nonembolic cerebrovascular disease were evaluated for underlying prothrombotic factors. Activated protein C resistance (APC-R) was measured by Dahlback's method and the modified method using factor V-deficient plasma. Activities of antithrombin (AT) III, protein C and S were measured. Anticardiolipin antibody was estimated by ELISA and lupus anticoagulant by kaolin clotting tests. APC-R was the most common defect (21.62%) followed by AT III deficiency and presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (5.6% each). The latter two were present together in one case. It is thus concluded that APC-R is the most common defect underlying idiopathic nonembolic cerebrovascular infarction in young individuals.
