4950 coronary arteriographies performed by the percutaneous transfemoral technique (Judkins) are reviewed with respect to mortality, morbidity of myocardial infarctions and cerebral emboli, incidence of femoral thrombectomies and incidence of threatening events like arrhythmias and contrast reactions. With increasing number of coronary arteriographies that were performed yearly the incidence of all complications could be reduced by more than 90%.
