A 5-year-old with spastic quadraparetic cerebral palsy suffered multiple strokes after extensive orthopedic surgery. Coagulation testing was undertaken to determine whether a familial thrombophilia was present. The patient was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden. Factor V Leiden may be a risk factor for central nervous system events in special-needs children, particularly when common medical conditions create additional procoagulant risks.
