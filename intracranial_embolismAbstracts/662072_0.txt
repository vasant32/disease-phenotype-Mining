Athough it has been generally believed that it is extremely difficult to prepare an experimental model of cerebral infarction in the dog with the use of temporary vascular occlusion, the procedure recently developed by one of the authors fascilitates the production of a localized infarction in the thalamus with a noticeably high rate of success. To obtain more reliability of this method, techniques of electroencephalography induced from depth electrode to the thalamus were applied in this experiment. Following a temporary vascular occlusion, a significant diminution of fast wave component of about 10 Hz occurred with attenuation of voltage in the ipsilateral thalamic depth electrode. In cases of 2 hour vascular occlusion done by this method, an obvious infarction in the thalamus was confirmed histologically 7 days later. The authors emphasised that when the experimental model of thalamic infarction in the dog are combined with EEG, not only can cerebral infarction be producted with more certainly but also the EEG changes can be followed. This analysis is important since it provides information on the chronological changes in the ischemic region or infarction lesion.
