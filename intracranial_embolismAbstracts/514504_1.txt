Microembolization from an ulcerated carotid artery to both occipital lobes via a persistent trigeminal artery was observed in a patient presenting with episodic bilateral central scotomata. Symptomatic relief was obtained following carotid endarterectomy. This unique pathway which resulted in occipital lobe ischemia has not been previously reported.
