Perfusion of the microcirculation after stroke is central to preserving neuronal function and improving functional outcome. Using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and a novel computer software program, MIRAGE, we measured a reduction in cerebral microvessel diameter after 1 and 4 h of embolic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. The methodology used by MIRAGE for measurement of blood vessel diameter involves a linearly applied spherical inflation technique. Three-dimensional quantitative analysis revealed a significant (P<0.05) mean 10-12% reduction in vessel diameter in the ipsilateral cortex when compared to the homologous region in the contralateral hemisphere. This reduction was seen only in the cortex and not the striatum. A larger reduction in mean vessel diameter in the ipsilateral cortex, 16-30% (P<0.05) was observed when compared to sham control rats. These results are in strong agreement with other studies using different stroke models and imaging techniques. Our work represents a novel application of LSCM technology to the three dimensional investigation of microvessel diameter changes in acute stroke and identifies its potential as an important tool for investigation of cerebral pathology.
