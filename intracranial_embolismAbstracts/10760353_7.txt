Abnormal left ventricular (LV) systolic function is an independent risk factor for stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation. Warfarin given in a dose to achieve an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0  or 2.5 to 4.0 (mean ratio 2.9)  is more efficacious than aspirin in reducing the incidence of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation. This study reports on 36-month follow-up data from 350 older persons with chronic atrial fibrillation showing the effect of warfarin versus aspirin on the incidence of new thromboembolic stroke in persons with abnormal and normal LV ejection fraction.
