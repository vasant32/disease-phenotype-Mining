Adverse neurological events, both focal (Type I) and non-focal (Type II), have been appreciated in postoperative on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients for many years. Advanced age is a significant risk factor for adverse neurological events following CABG surgery. With full knowledge that our elderly population of patients was at high risk for these untoward neurological events, we adopted a comprehensive operative and perfusion strategy in an attempt to attenuate the incidence of these complications. Our strategy included efforts to minimise the number of emboli generated during the operation, avoid cerebral hypoperfusion, and attenuate the systemic inflammatory response. From 15 August 2002 to 31 December 2005, we performed 355 on-pump CABG operations. The incidence of Type I focal injury was 0/355 (0%), the incidence of Type II non-focal injury was 9/355 (2.5%), and postoperative mortality was 2/355 (0.6%). These results compared favorably to the results predicted by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons' (STS) model, and may suggest efficacy.
