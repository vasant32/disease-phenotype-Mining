Summary: Concern regarding the safety of Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) exists because of the risk of cerebral embolization during the procedure. The purpose of this article is to discuss that technology modification may improve the outcomes of this procedure. Between October 1997 and October 2004, 439 consecutive patients with 478 stenotic carotid arteries were treated. 284 vessels were stented without the use of embolic protection devices and 194 vessels with protection. Among cases not using protection device, 201 arteries were stented with predilation alone, 63 with postdilation alone, six with both pre- and post-dilation, two with neither and twelve were stented with balloon expandable stents. The technical success of 100%.The combined stroke and death rate during the procedure and the 30-day follow-up at 30 days was 1.67% overall. Three (0.63%) deaths occurred; one was due to a major infarction secondary to stent breakage, and two died of massive reperfusion intracerebral haemorrhage. There were total six ischemic stroke, of the five ischemic strokes wich developed in nonprotection group, two were among 201 cases with predilation alone (0.99%), which developed after stent deployment and postprocedure, and three among 63 cases with postdilation alone (4.76%), which developed immediately after postdilation. The incidence of ischemic stroke was lower among those who were stented with predilation alone than among those who were stented with postdilation alone. This likely results from reduced intimal injury and decreased risk of embolic complications.
