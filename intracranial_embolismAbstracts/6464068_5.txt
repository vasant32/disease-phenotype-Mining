Mandurai City is a composite of many villages with a total population not exceeding one million. Undoubtedly more than 95% of the hospital patients come from the rural areas. Our Government Hospital is the largest and reflects the medical assistance provided for people of average and low income. In our experience, 15% of cerebrovascular strokes occur in those below 40 years of age. Meningovascular neurosyphilis in men (10-15%) and puerperal cerebral venous thrombosis in women (20%) were the two commonly proved causes. Haemorrhagic stroke was uncommon. Embolic strokes from rheumatic heart disease formed 10%. In over 50%, the cause of stroke was not clear. Among 150 patients with neurosyphilis, mostly men, 25 had cerebral arterial thrombosis with stroke syndrome. This study reports on 138 patients with cerebral venous thrombosis and 7 patients with arterial thrombosis in puerperium. Mortality was 20% and quality of survival was good. The incidence, clinical picture, and diagnostic investigations are discussed with a review of literature.
