We present the methodology and some preliminary findings of a population-based stroke incidence register operating in Tilburg (about 150,000 persons), The Netherlands. From October 1, 1978 to March 31, 1979, 152 new strokes occurred giving an estimated overall incidence (per 100,000 population) for total and first attacks of 202 and 162, respectively. No major sex difference in stroke risk (all ages) was noted, although males did have a significantly higher incidence at 55--64 years of age. Stroke incidence increased strikingly with age. Thromboembolic infarcts comprised 83% and intracranial hemorrhage 13% of attacks. Males and females differed little in distribution of stroke types. The proportion of cerebral infarction was higher among older than younger cases. The opposite was true regarding intracranial hemorrhage. Embolic infarcts constituted a significantly higher proportion of cases at 65--74 years of age than at other ages. Hemiplegia and speech deficits dominated the clinical picture at onset. The 3-week case fatality for all strokes was 26%. Both a lowering of consciousness (found among 38% of cases during the first 24 hours) and a history of prior stroke were found related to a reduction in survival. Of patients surviving 3 weeks 25% were completely dependent and 25% partially dependent upon others for personal care.
