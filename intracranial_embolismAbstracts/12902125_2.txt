A 25-year-old man presenting with peripheral and cerebral emboli was incidentally detected as having a left ventricular mass on two-dimensional echocardiographic examination of the heart. In absence of any obvious structural heart disease or hypercoagulable state, the mass was presumptively diagnosed as left ventricular myxoma. The patient was operated on, and histopathology revealed the mass to be a thrombus. The cause and pathogenesis of the left ventricular thrombus, differential diagnosis, and management are discussed. The rarity of the case is highlighted.
