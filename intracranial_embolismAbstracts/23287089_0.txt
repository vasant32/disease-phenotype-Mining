The primary mechanisms responsible for acute neurological deterioration following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) include cerebral embolism, cerebral hypoperfusion and/or inflammatory process triggered by CPB. Extradural hematoma (EDH) following CPB is rare but associated with significant mortality and morbidity. We present a case of EDH following double valve replacement in an adolescent boy.
