The coincidence of pulmonary and systemic emboli suggests paradoxical embolism. We present the case of a young man in whom a blood clot travelled from the veins in a retroperitoneal liposarcoma via a patent foramen ovalis to the systemic arterial circulation. Young patients with embolic disease but no obvious source of thrombus may have underlying neoplastic disease. Venous thrombosis is a frequent complication of neoplastic disease. Arterial embolism associated with neoplasm is, however, not widely recognised.
