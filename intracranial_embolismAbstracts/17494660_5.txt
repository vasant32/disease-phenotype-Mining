A prototype endovascular electromechanical clot-extraction device was fabricated using a combination of shape memory polymer and shape memory nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol). Five embolic vascular occlusions were created in 4 rabbits by injecting thermally coagulated blood through a 4F catheter in the common carotid artery. Angiography immediately after clot injection showed complete or partial occlusion of the common carotid artery. Posttreatment angiography showed complete (2/5), partial (2/5), or no (1/5) restoration of blood flow.
