38 cases of ischemic apoplexy were randomly divided into three groups. Among them 26 cases were treated with type I and type III of Buyang Huanwu Tang Granule (BYHWTG) for 10 weeks, respectively. The other 12 cases served as a control group. The results showed that clinical cure and markedly effective rate were 42.3%, the total effective rate was 88.5% in BYHWTG group. The effective rate of BYHWTG type I for the treatment of ischemic apoplexy was 100% and it was superior to type III (84.6). BYHWTG could significantly improve hemorheologic indexes in the patients of ischemic apoplexy. The activity of RBC sodium pump was markedly raised from 0.210 +/- 0.003 to 0.250 +/- 0.008 1/h (P < 0.001) in BYHWTG type I. The results of this study suggested that BYHWTG had evident efficacy in the treatment of ischemic apoplexy.
