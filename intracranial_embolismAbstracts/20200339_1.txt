BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of ischemic strokes have an embolic mechanism, but the source of embolism is not detected. Coexistence of subdiaphragmatic visceral infarction (SDVI; e.g., renal, splenic, hepatic, bowel infarction) may be a suggestion of a common source of embolism. One large autopsy study found SDVI in 21.5% of patients with fatal stroke. METHOD: We performed diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance abdominal imaging and subsequently performed it in consecutive patients with stroke or TIA and a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: Among 27 patients, 6 had SDVI (3 recent renal, 1 recent splenic, and 3 old splenic infarction). The median time between onset of ischemic stroke and abdominal MRI was 8 days (interquartile range 3-15 days). No predictive factor of SDVI was found in this study population with respect to demographic or ultrasound characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: One in 5 patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke or TIA may be associated with subdiaphragmatic visceral infarction (SDVI). Further study should evaluate the frequency of SDVI in patients with stroke of unknown cause.
