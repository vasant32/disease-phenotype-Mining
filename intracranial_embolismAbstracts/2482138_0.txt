Acute cerebral infarction of 141 cases with treatment combining TCM and WM was reported. The significant effective rate and the effective rate were 65% and 84% in the LT group (low molecular dextran + TCM) respectively; in the LN group (low molecular dextran + Nicotinic acid) were 29% and 41% respectively; in the T group (Salvia miltiorrhiza + Astragalus + Puraria) were 40% and 81.8% respectively. Among them the therapeutic effect in the LT group was the best. The LT group was also superior to the other two groups in serious cases. Cerebral edema developed following cerebrovascular dilator in a week after cerebral infarction; in the early stage, the therapeutic effect could be improved by giving mannitol first and then cerebrovascular dilator. Heart failure could be easily induced by low molecular dextran in the cerebral infarction following rheumatic heart disease. The therapeutic effect was poor in those cases with recurrent cerebral infarction.
