BACKGROUND: Afibrinogenemia, a rare coagulation disorder, has not been associated with vertebral artery dissections. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-old woman with afibrinogenemia developed spontaneous neck pain followed by a right medullary infarction, and MR angiography showed extensive bilateral vertebral artery dissection. She was treated with fibrinogen replacement and anticoagulants and showed a favorable evolution, with only mild residual right upper arm incoordination. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient spontaneous bilateral vertebral artery dissection complicated afibrinogenemia. Since anticoagulant therapy is usually indicated for arterial dissection, this association created a therapeutic problem. This patient received anticoagulants with fibrinogen replacement, which resulted in a favorable evolution.
