BACKGROUND: Cellulose acetate polymer (CAP) is a new liquid embolic material that has been used experimentally in intravascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. But this compound is still controversial in some aspects such as safety, efficiency, and histological changes. In this study, we re-evaluated the material with regard to intravascular treatment of aneurysms. METHODS: The carotid arteries of rats and experimental aneurysms in canines were embolized with CAP. The effects of CAP were evaluated according to angiographic and histological results. RESULTS: A strong chemo-corrosive effect was observed. This led to severe damage to vessels and rupture of two thrombosed canine aneurysm models. There were significant technical difficulties including out-flow of CAP and a high rate of occlusion of the parent arteries. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that currently CAP is not an ideal embolic material for intracranial aneurysms. Further tests and improvements are needed before it can be widely used clinically.
