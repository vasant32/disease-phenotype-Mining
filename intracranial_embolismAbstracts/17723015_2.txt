PURPOSE: To determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with acute stroke who underwent angioplasty of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA). METHODS: Patients were eligible for CAS if they presented within 6 hours of symptom onset and had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score >4. The records of all 18 acute stroke patients (11 men; mean age 68.3+/-14.3 years) who underwent endovascular intervention in the stroke-related extracranial ICA between May 2003 and February 2006 were reviewed. Fourteen (77.8%) had atheromatous obstructions and 4 (22.2%) had dissection of the extracranial ICA. Major adverse cerebral and cardiac events (MACCEs) and neurological status, including NIHSS and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, were recorded for all patients. RESULTS: Successful revascularization was achieved in 83.3% (15/18) of the patients. Cerebral protection devices were applied successfully in 13 (72.2%). At discharge, a neurological improvement (NIHSS reduction > or =4) was observed in 77.8% (14/18) of patients. The clinical success rate was 72.2% (13/18). The median NIHSS was 8.5 on admission versus 4.5 at discharge (p<0.01). The 30-day death and stroke rate was 11.1%. During the 14.6+/-9.3-month follow-up, the MACCE and the death/stroke rates were 33.3% and 27.8%, respectively. The median mRS scores at 30 days and at midterm follow-up were 1 and 2.5, respectively (p = NS). CONCLUSION: Endovascular revascularization of the extracranial ICA in patients with acute ischemic stroke is associated with high procedural success rates and favorable midterm outcome.
