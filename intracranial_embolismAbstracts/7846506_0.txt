For monitoring the Doppler spectrum of the vertebral and basilar arteries the authors have used a microball vacuum cushion for fixing the head of the patient in lateral, moderately anteflected position, and a three lockable joint type instrument holder allowing adjustment of the probe suboccipitally. This setting was used for transforaminal vertebrobasilar emboli monitoring in 5 patients having prosthetic heart valves. As an alternative technique a microball filled vacuum collar was tried out for immobilisation of the patient's head, and a snake neck type surgical instrument holder for guiding the probe.
