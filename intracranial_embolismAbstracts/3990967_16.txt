In a retrospective study of scuba divers with neurologic injuries, we found that mild symptoms were common. Seventy divers had decompression sickness, most often with paresthesias or numbness, rarely with paresis. Thirty-nine divers had air embolism that often caused unconsciousness or mild symptoms of cerebral injury. Many divers with neurologic decompression sickness gave histories of dives that were within conventional limits, and many with air embolism gave no history of breath-holding during ascent. Mild symptoms sometimes regressed spontaneously. Recompression delays were responsible for poor responses to therapy.
