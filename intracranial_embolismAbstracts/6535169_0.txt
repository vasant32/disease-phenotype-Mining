The authors present 19 cases of stroke with subsequent hemiplegia in children from 5 months to 15 years of age. These cases are not strictly correlated with haematologic alterations. The aetiopathogenesis remains uncertain in the most of patients, in which predisposing causes are absent and angiographic pictures do not demonstrate anatomical lesions or occlusions of cerebral vessels. In our series, cerebral angiography was performed in 16 children and showed vascular alterations only in 6 cases. CT scan some time after the acute hemiplegia, demonstrated low-density areas in 12 cases over 17 examined, with the characteristic evolution of ischemic lesions.
