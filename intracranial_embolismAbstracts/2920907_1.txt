A 22-year-old woman presenting with recurrent transient episodes of vertebro-basilar artery syndrome and blurred vision was initially diagnosed as suffering from a collagen disease affecting the retina and CNS. Treatment with systemic steroids induced an apparent remission. However, a rapid deterioration of her condition prompted a reevaluation of the diagnosis and treatment. Ophthalmoscopic examination disclosed numerous ischemic foci in both eyes, scattered superficial hemorrhages, and neovascular tufts on the optic nerves. The possibility that both the cerebral and ocular phenomena were the results of systemic showering of emboli was raised. Careful two-dimensional echo cardiography revealed a mitral mass compatible with myxoma of the left atrium. The difficult differential diagnosis of combined encephalopathy and retinopathy is discussed.
