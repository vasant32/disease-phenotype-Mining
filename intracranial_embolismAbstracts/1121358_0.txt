In cases of thrombotic cerebral infarction the leucergic and thrombergic tests were done on the 2nd and 3d days of the disease and after 48 hours from the first dextran loading. Fleck's test tube method was used in the leucergy test. The proportion of agglutinated platelets was calculated from a smear stained by Papanicolau method. The results were processed statistically. An inhibitory effect of dextran on aggregation of white blood cells and platelets was observed in the blood of patients with cerebral infarction. The inhibitory effects of dextran was greater in relation to aggregation of platelets than white blood cells. However, in our investigations the effect of this agent on both processes was transient.
