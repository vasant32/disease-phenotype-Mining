BACKGROUND: Isolated left ventricular noncompaction (ILVNC) is a rare congenital condition that is the result of an intrauterine developmental arrest, which stops the compaction of the loose myocardial fiber meshwork of the left ventricle. This condition is recognized by an excessively prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses of the left ventricle. Although these intertrabecular recesses are prone to thrombus formation, with resulting embolic sequelae, the literature describes only 1 adult case of a stroke caused by ILVNC. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of cerebral cardioembolism in a 33-year-old man due to ILVNC. Because of echocardiography (ECHO) findings in this case, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) was performed, which allowed a definite diagnosis to be obtained. CONCLUSION: This case should highlight the importance of performing cMRI especially in younger patients with embolic stroke, if the ECHO suggests a suspected myocardial disorder.
