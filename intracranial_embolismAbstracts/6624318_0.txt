The authors studied the process of platelet and erythrocyte aggregation in blood passing through a special chamber designed to simulate an intact vessel and a vessel which is either stenosed or pathologically convoluted. Aggregate formation was shown to be dramatically increased in simulating a part of a vessel with an altered geometrical pattern of the blood flow, with the increase being more pronounced when the blood from patients with cerebral dyshemias was applied. It was found that in patients with cerebral infarction, the antiaggregate activity of the blood passing through the internal carotid arteries on the affected side was lower than in other sections of the blood stream. The importance of identified regularities in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases is discussed.
