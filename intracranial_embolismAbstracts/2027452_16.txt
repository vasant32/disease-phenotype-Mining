The cerebral fat embolism is a potentially serious complication of fractures but clinical cases often go undiagnosed. Two cases of clinically diagnosed cerebral fat embolism are reported, and MR images of these patients are described. While brain CT revealed no abnormality, MR imaging showed relative low-intensity areas on T1-weighted images and high-intensity areas on T2-weighted images. In one patient follow-up MR showed nearly complete resolution of the abnormal signal. MR imaging appears to be valuable for detecting the lesions in these patients.
