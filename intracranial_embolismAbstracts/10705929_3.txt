Following central nervous system insults, control of intracranial pressure may lessen the incidence of morbidity and mortality. Therapies to control intracranial pressure include osmolar agents, prevention of and control of seizures, drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, hypothermia, and barbiturates. Control of agitation and excessive patient movement are additional components in the management of ICP. Although opioids and benzodiazepines are generally effective, in a small subset of patients, alternative agents may be necessary. The authors present 2 children with increased ICP in whom propofol was used to provide sedation and control ICP. The use of propofol in this setting and its possible applications in the children with increased ICP are discussed.
