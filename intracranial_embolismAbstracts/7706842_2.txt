In this case example it was determined that midbrain ischemia and hyponatremia caused a decreased level of consciousness and inappropriate behavior in this patient. As serum sodium levels corrected and the collateral circulation improved, her level of consciousness increased accordingly. Despite her rocky clinical course, GDCs proved to be a viable alternative to surgery. The GDCs successfully obliterated her aneurysm and she fully recovered. Basilar tip aneurysms have a significant risk associated with location and the possibility of aneurysmal rupture. Surgical intervention is difficult, furthering coil embolization as a reasonable alternative treatment in some cases. Quality care of these patients focuses on diligent neurological assessment, comfort strategies and patient and family education. Management of this population requires close assessment and early intervention to achieve expected outcomes.
