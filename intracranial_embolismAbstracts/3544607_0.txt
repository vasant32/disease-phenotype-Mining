Aneurysm of the extracranial internal carotid artery is a rarely observed condition. Intra-aneurysmatic thrombosis, cerebral embolism with possible neurological consequences, and rupture are the most common complications. Operations were performed on 20 patients for aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. The cases included 14 "genuine" arteriosclerotic aneurysms and seven "false" aneurysms in the wake of shell splinter injuries, tonsillectomy, thrombo-arteriectomy, and blunt traumata. Pulsating tumour was the most important clinical symptom in all aneurysm cases. Arterial continuity was restored by resection of aneurysm in all cases. Sixteen patients were dehospitalised without any complaint. Two patients with preoperative cerebral infarction were left with residual paresis. One patient died of pulmonary embolism, and one patient operated on for rupture died in shock.
