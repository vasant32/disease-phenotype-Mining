Severe abnormalities of plasma electrolyte concentrations were observed in 4 children who had massive hyperlipidaemia secondary to poorly-controlled, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These electrolyte values were fallacious and invoked problems of clinical management, particularly with regard to fluid replacement. Each case is described and the interpretation of plasma elecytolyte values in hyperlipidaemia is discussed.
