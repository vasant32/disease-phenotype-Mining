Left ventricular thrombi were found in 25 patients by two-dimensional echocardiography. All patients were in atrial fibrillation, 16 had mitral or mitroaortic valve diseases and nine mitral or mitroaortic bioprosthetic valves. Nine patients (36%) had history of arterial embolism. At diagnostic time, oral anticoagulation with coumadin was instaured in all the patients. Periodic clinic and echocardiography follow-up was performed. Left atrial thrombi either disappeared (18 patients [72%]) or reduced their size (one patient). Six patients with mitral stenosis were considered as candidates to percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, which was performed in 4 patients whose thrombi disappeared with anticoagulation therapy in 6 months. During the follow-up one patient had cerebral embolism without sequelae. Conclusions: 1st. Patients with left atrial thrombi have high risk for arterial embolism. 2nd. Left atrial thrombi disappear in a high proportion after prescribing oral anticoagulation, which has some important therapeutic implications.
