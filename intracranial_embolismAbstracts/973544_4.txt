The statistical data, obtained in seventy five brains with lacunar state, show that the lenticular nuclei and the periventricular arterial end-and borderzones are the main seats of the infarcts. In teen brains the relationship between the deep arterial angioarchitecture and the location of thirty lacunes is studied by means of the translucidation technique after filling the arterial system with a collo√Ædal barium sulphate solution. The deep perforating arteries are poorly filled and show several narrowings and post-stenotic dilatations. In twenty-four lacunes, an occlusion of the responsible artery is found. In the six remaining lacunes, no occlusion of the main artery is observed but the side-branches are not demonstrated. The significance of these findings and the relationship between the location of the occlusion and the topography of the lacune are discussed.
