Computed tomography in a 3 1/2-year-old boy with ataxia, lethargy, fever, vomiting, and increasing irritability revealed moderate hydrocephalus and a blood density mass lesion lying superior and posterior to the 3rd ventricle. On several of the sections, the blood density was greater in the dependent than in the superior portion of the mass. The average attenuation number within the mass was 40 EMI units. The infusion of contrast agent demonstrated capsular enhancement (a target sign), which was also demonstrated by angiography. The diagnosis, which was confirmed at operation, was thrombosis of an aneurysm of the vein of Galen. The massive thrombus was resected, but the aneurysm was not excised. The patient's recovery was uneventful.
