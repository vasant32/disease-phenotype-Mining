A woman, aged 38, lost consciousness immediately after manipulation of the cervical spine and remained in coma for nearly 5 years in a combined decorticate and decerebrate state. Cerebral angiography revealed impaired circulation in the vertebrobasilar system. The EEG initially showed generalized cerebral dysrhythmia but tended, over the years, to become more normal with desynchronized fast activity of low voltage. Neuropathological examination postmortem revealed a large cystic lesion in the pressure equalization area of the carotid and basilar circulation in the upper pons, mesencephalon, posterior hypothalamus and basal thalamus. No definite stenosis or occlusion was seen in the cerebral vessels on angiography or at the postmortem examination. The mechanism of the lesion is considered to have been temporary interference with the blood flow in the vertebrobasilar system during manipulation of the cervical spine sufficient to cause ischemia and subsequent infarction of the brainstem. The pathogenesis of vascular lesions of the brain stem following manipulation of the cervical spine is discussed briefly.
