A patient who had alexia without agraphia, right homonymous hemianopia, and intact color-naming was studied anatomically. Pathologic involvement of the splenium and related forceps was restricted to the inferior third, supporting published suggestions that inferior elements of this commissure and left peristriate cortex may be essential to the decoding to the written word, while color-naming may be functionally aligned to more dorsal elements.
