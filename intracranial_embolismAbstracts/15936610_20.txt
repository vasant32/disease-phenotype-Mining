OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the prognosis of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) and to determine the incidence of cerebral embolism under continued oral anticoagulation. BACKGROUND: Patients with AF and dense SEC have an increased risk of cerebral embolism. However, there is little knowledge about the long-term fate and the rate of clinical silent cerebral embolism under continued oral anticoagulation. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, all consecutive patients with AF and dense SEC were included in the study. We performed serial and prospective transesophageal echocardiography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical examinations during a period of 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients with dense SEC and AF were included. The control group consisted of 143 patients with faint SEC and AF. During the follow-up period, three patients (2%) had cerebral embolism with neurologic deficits. A total of eight patients (6%) died due to embolic events, and 19 (15%) patients had silent embolism, as documented on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with an event had significantly lower left atrial appendage peak emptying velocities and more commonly had a history of previous thromboembolism and denser SEC, as compared with patients without an event. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AF and dense SEC have a high likelihood of cerebral embolism (22%) and/or death, despite oral anticoagulation. Low peak emptying velocities of the left atrial appendage and dense SEC are independent predictors of an event.
