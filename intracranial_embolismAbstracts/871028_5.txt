Sudden death is defined as any death that occurs less than 24 hours after the onset of first symptoms. Strokes account for 10 to 20% of all sudden deaths. The records of all residents of Rochester, Minn., who had their first stroke during the period 1955 through 1969 were analyzed. Among 255 deaths caused by the first stroke, 52 were sudden. Twenty-six of the deaths were due to primary intracerebral hemorrhage, and 20 to primary subarachnoid hemorrhage. Only two of the sudden deaths were caused by infarction: one by pontine and cerebellar infarct and the second by a cortical infarct, which resulted in death from status epilepticus. Among the nine patients who died within 2 hours of the onset of symptoms, six had primary subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hypertension was noted in 23 of the 26 patients (88%) who died of primary intracerebral hemorrhage; 8 patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage were on long-term oral anticoagulant therapy, and all 8 were hypertensive.
