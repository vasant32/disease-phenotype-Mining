Clinical and laboratory findings are described in the case of a patient with a vein of Galen aneurysm who presented with recurrent aseptic meningitis for which no etiology could be identified. The patient subsequently developed thalamic and intraventricular hemorrhage associated with partial thrombosis of the dilated vein of Galen. Review of the literature revealed no previously reported association of these conditions. Recurrent cerebral venous thrombosis involving the fistula is hypothesized as the cause of repeated inflammatory reactions near the subarachnoid space. More extensive thrombosis may then have precipitated the hemorrhage.
