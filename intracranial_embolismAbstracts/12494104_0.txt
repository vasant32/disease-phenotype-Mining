In 66 patients with embolic stroke of cardiac origin (33 with persistent and 33 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) transthoracic and transesophageal (21 patients, 31.2%) echocardiography was used for detection of atrial thrombosis. Lone atrial fibrillation was significantly more frequent among patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Frequency of thrombosis of left atrial appendage was similar in patients with nonrheumatic persistent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
