Stroke from a calcific cerebral artery embolus demonstrated by noncontrast computed tomography (CT) is rare. Although the ability of CT to demonstrate early acute cerebral emboli is limited, in the uncommon event of a calcific cerebral embolus, CT can easily visualize the embolized material. We present an unusual case of calcific cerebral arterial embolization to the proximal middle cerebral artery and illustrate the usefulness of CT in diagnosing this rare entity in conjunction with important predisposing clinical factors.
