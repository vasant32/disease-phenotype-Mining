In 45 patients with brain strokes (thrombosis, embolus, intracerebral haemorrhages) and subarachnoid haemorrhages the CPK activity was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid. In most cases a significant rise was observed in CPK activity in the cerebrospinal fluid as compared to the control group. In two cases the dynamics of CPK activity changes were studied in the cerebrospinal fluid during the stroke. It seems that a significant rise in CPK activity develops in the initial phase of the stroke when the area of nervous tissue softening develops and spreads.
