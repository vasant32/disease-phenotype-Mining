Despite anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, some patients still suffer an ischaemic stroke. The issue of whether to stop or continue warfarin, or possibly to reverse the anticoagulation is an area of uncertainty.

In this article we review the published evidence in an attempt to quantify the risks and benefits of each treatment strategy and identify areas for further research.
