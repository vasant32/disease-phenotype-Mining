We report the cases of two patients with mobile floating carotid plaques (MFCP). Two men were referred to us for carotid investigation after trauma. The duplex ultrasonography scan (DUS) showed the presence of a mobile floating plaque into the internal carotid artery associated with a stenosis of 40% and 65%, respectively (ECST criteria). Both patients were asymptomatic. Early CEA was performed (<24 h after admission). Intraoperatively it was confirmed the presence of MFCP. The patients were discharged without neurological symptoms two days postoperatively. At the follow-up the DUS showed the patency of the CEA without restenosis or residual flap.
