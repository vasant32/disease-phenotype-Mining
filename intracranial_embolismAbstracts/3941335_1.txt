Brain abscesses in rats were produced by intra-arterial injection of septic homologous blood clot emboli. The production rate was 100% and the histopathological features closely resembled those seen in other animal models and in spontaneously occurring brain abscesses in humans. This small-animal model may be useful for systematic study of the development of brain abscesses as well as for evaluation of various therapeutic procedures.
