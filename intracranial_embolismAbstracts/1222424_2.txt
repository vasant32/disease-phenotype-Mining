Experience with 648 consecutive percutaneous transfemoral coronary arteriograms and left ventriculograms performed in a teaching laboratory without the use of systemic anticoagulation during the procedure was reviewed. Only 1 death was felt to be related to a procedure, and this occurred 3 weeks after a myocardial infarction. There were 10 myocardial infarctions or emboli, 8 cerebral vascular accidents, and 7 femoral artery complications. Only 1 patient experienced a residual neurologic change following a procedure-related cerebral vascular accident, and this was a mild visual field defect. Clotting of the catheter without sequelae but necessitating procedural changes occurred in 10 instances. The transient nature of the neurologic deficits and the low mortality suggest that the emboli which occurred in these patients were small, possibly platelet-fibrin accumulations. It is postulated that with the use of careful technic larger emboli capable of producing myocardial infarction with shock or disabling cerebral vascular accidents can be prevented, even in a training situation. However, smaller embolic phenomena probably cannot be completely avoided by the use of careful technic, and it is for prevention of small emboli that systemic anticoagulation with heparin may be of value.
