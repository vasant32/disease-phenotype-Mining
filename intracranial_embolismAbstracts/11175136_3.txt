Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death worldwide. It encompasses several clinical entities, including coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Because the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is the same, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease frequently coexist. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is routinely done in patients with ischemic stroke to exclude possible cardiac sources of cerebral embolism. Since the introduction of multiplane transesophageal transducers, it has become easier to visualize the proximal coronary arteries during transesophageal examinations. We report three cases in which routine TEE for ischemic stroke revealed significant coronary artery disease that was not previously suspected. In one patient, the stroke was so severe that further evaluation of the coronary artery disease was not deemed useful. The other two patients underwent coronary angiography based on the echocardiographic findings, confirming the lesions noted on the echocardiogram. Subsequently, both patients were successfully revascularized: one by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the other by coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We conclude that the examination of coronary arteries during routine TEE for ischemic stroke may become a useful screening tool for the detection of coexisting, asymptomatic, significant proximal coronary artery disease.
