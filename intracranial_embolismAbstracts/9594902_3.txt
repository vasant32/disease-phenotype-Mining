The technique of computer-aided transcranial Doppler echography for continuous control of cerebral perfusion during minimally invasive mitral valve operations using the Port-Access system is described. Temporary displacement of the endoclamp in the aortic arch (brachiocephalic trunk, left carotid artery) is followed by cerebral embolic signals and a sudden decrease in the blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries.
