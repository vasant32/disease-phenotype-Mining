A pathological examination was performed on normotensive rats (NTR) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following bilateral common carotid artery ligation. After ligation, diffuse and extensive cerebral infarcts in the carotid artery territory occurred frequently in SHR, while NTR occasionally had well-circumscribed small infarcts. The posterior communicating arteries, which are the major anastomotic channels connecting the carotid and vertebrobasilar systems, did not show any anomalies and were well developed in SHR and NTR. Vascular changes secondary to hypertension, such as fibrinoid necrosis or thickening of the wall, were not observed in SHR. Because of the paucity of structural difference of the blood vessels, the more diffuse and extensive cerebral infarcts in SHR after carotid occlusion were attributed to the hemodynamic difference rather than the morphological difference between the two groups. The results of the present experiment suggest that hypertension per se, i.e., hemodynamic factors, may be operative for the development of cerebral infarction.
