We report a case of cerebral air embolism caused by right subclavian vein catheterization. A large amount of air was seen only over the left cerebral hemisphere on computed tomographic (CT) scans. Although neurological deficit was observed bilaterally at the onset, the degree of ischemic brain damage was far greater in the left cerebral hemisphere than in the right. This unusual left-sided predominancy of cerebral air embolism was presumably due to the tortuosity of the ascending aorta.
