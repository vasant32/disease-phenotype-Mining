Balloon valvuloplasty has been shown to be a relatively safe and effective intervention in palliating the symptoms of severe calcific aortic stenosis in the elderly [1-7]. Although the mechanism of balloon valvuloplasty is plastic deformation and fracture of the calcified valve tissue [2], complications such as embolic events or acute myocardial infarction due to aortic balloon valvuloplasty are very rare. Previously published reports mentioned only one case of cerebral embolism [5] and two patients with late fatal myocardial infarction [4]. In this report we present an elderly patient with calcific aortic stenosis who developed an acute lateral myocardial infarction during percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
