Aneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid arteries are rare. They may provoke symptoms of adjacent neurovascular structure compression, cerebral embolization, or rupture. An 81-year-old woman was found to have a saccular aneurysm of 2.2 cm in diameter in the left internal carotid with concomitant kinking. She underwent resection of the aneurysm and the kinked arterial area, followed by end-to-end anastomosis of the internal carotid artery.
