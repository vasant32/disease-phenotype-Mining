Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is the most common central venous anomaly in the thorax, which may remain asymptomatic throughout life. Indwelling catheters that are increasingly used in oncology practice may result in complications in the presence of PLSVC. The authors report an unusual case of recurrent ischemic attacks each time a portacath was accessed in a patient with breast cancer and PLSVC. This case highlights the importance of suspecting this condition in the presence of clinical and radiographic clues to prevent complications.
