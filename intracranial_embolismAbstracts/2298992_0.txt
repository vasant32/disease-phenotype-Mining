A differentiation between embolic versus thrombotic infarction has been attempted on the basis of sequential CT of 32 patients fulfilling our clinical and angiographic criteria for embolic or thrombotic cerebral infarction of the middle cerebral arterial distribution. In the 20 patients of the embolic group, a large homogeneous low attenuation area was seen in every case. In 18 of these 20 patients, the low attenuation area extended from the deep brain to the cortex. In the 12 patients of the thrombotic group, 10 had an inhomogeneous low attenuation area that did not involve the cortices in 8 cases. The frequency of hemorrhagic transformation in the embolic group was higher than in the thrombotic group. Computed tomography showed discrete areas of increased attenuation corresponding to an angiographically occluded artery in 7 of the 20 patients in the embolic group. Sequential CT can assist in differentiating between embolic and thrombotic infarction.
