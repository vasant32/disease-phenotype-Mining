Cardiac hemangiomas are rare, benign vascular tumors of the heart. Because of their clinical manifestations, diagnosis is difficult and few surgeons can draw from extensive experience. The purpose of this study was to report an additional case of cardiac hemangioma and to analyze the unexpected aspect of this disease. In our case, echocardiography demonstrated a mass in the left ventricle. Surgical resection was done using cardiopulmonary bypass. Histopathological examination revealed that the tumor was a hemangioma. The short-term outcome was favorable.
