Recurrent occlusive stroke of the vertebrobasilar system is reported in a 16-years-old man. Multiple arterial occlusions, segmental stenosis, or irregular dilatation were found in the angiography involving both the intra- and extracranial vertebro-basilar arteries. Surgical specimen of the extracranial vertebral artery with localized irregular lumen disclosed fibroelastic thickening of the intima with mural thrombus, which were thought to be an embolic source. Etiological significance of this intimal lesion in juvenile cerebrosvascular accident is discussed.
