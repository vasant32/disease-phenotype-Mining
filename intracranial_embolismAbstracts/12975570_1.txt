Pacemaker related endocarditis is a rare potentially fatal condition, most commonly acquired during manipulation of the pacemaker system. Most patients have involvement of the right heart. Only rarely has involvement of the left-heart been documented. In the absence of controlled studies regarding management of such cases, many recommend complete removal of the pacing system along with intravenous antibiotics. We present a patient with documented pacemaker related left-sided endocarditis associated with an acute embolic stroke who was treated with antibiotics with complete recovery and its two-year follow up.
