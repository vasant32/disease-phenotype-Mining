The case is presented of a 37-year-old man with spontaneous thrombosis of a 10-mm left posterior communicating artery aneurysm, following presumed subarachnoid hemorrhage with negative angiography. Sequential magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance source imaging (at 2 weeks, 3 months, 2 years, and 2 years, 5 months) showed progressive shrinkage and disappearance of the aneurysm.
