We noted, during cerebral angiography, that the contrast medium was contaminated with numerous small black ink clots from gradation marks on syringes. In this report, we show that ink can be removed from syringes in solid form, and that they may result in embolic complications during cerebral angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To demonstrate that the ink from gradation marks on syringes can come off in a solid form and attach itself to the gloves during cerebral angiography, syringes were gripped many times (just as in an angiographic procedure) after immersion in contrast medium or 0.9% saline for 10 minutes. To see if difference of contrast medium and syringes could affect the removing of ink, five types of nonangiographic syringes and one type of angiographic syringe were rubbed with gauze after certain time periods after immersing them in four kinds of contrast medium or 0.9% saline. RESULTS: Ink attached itself to the gloves in a solid form by repeated gripping due to adherence of contrast medium. Ink was removed from all nonangiographic syringes by rubbing after immersion in any type of contrast medium for two hours. Gradation marks on angiographic syringes were stable with all types of contrast medium. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, ink for gradation marks on nonangiographic syringes, which is easily removed in a solid form due to contrast medium, can be the source of embolic complication during cerebral angiography.
