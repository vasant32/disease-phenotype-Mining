Based on the experience collected in 108 patients from a series of more than 7500 CT examinations, the possibilities and limitations of computed tomography in non-tumorous space-occupying lesions are discussed. Serious problems of differential diagnosis are encountered mainly in the case of cerebral abscesses and acute demyelinization, as well as granulomas. Cystic processes are usually easier to classify. Anamnesis will often be helpful in the case of parasites. Old intracerebral hemorrhages can simulate tumors and calcifications. The same applies to giant angiomas and giant aneurysms. In cerebral infarction, too, an occasional confusion with a tumor in the blood-brain barrier disturbance phase cannot be excluded.
