A 22-year-old man developed fat embolism syndrome. Although a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain showed nothing abnormal, a magnetic resonance imaging scan detected scattered spotty areas of low intensity on T1-weighted images and of high intensity on T2-weighted images. Magnetic resonance imaging is thought to be more sensitive than computed tomography in detecting cerebral fat embolism syndrome and correlates well with the clinical course.
