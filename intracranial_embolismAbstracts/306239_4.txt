A severe restriction of the visual field was observed in a patient suffering a bilateral occipital lobe infarction. Soon after the lesion, the visual field had an angle of approx. 4 degrees. Some recovery was observed within the following months. Within the restricted visual field, several visual functions were tested. Increment threshold, for instance, was found to be one log unit higher than would normally be expected. Color vision was completely lost soon after the lesion, but some recovery was later observed. Although binocular interaction was demonstrated by the interocular transfer of after-effects, the patient never experienced steropsis. He also seemed unable to recognize faces. Dsepite the small visual field, optokinetic nystagmus could be elicited. A notable slowing down of visual analyses was observed in experiments on visual reaction time, on the inversion of the Necker cube, and on binocular rivalry. The complete loss of certain functions like steropsis or face recognition in contrast to a quantitative reduction of other functions like visual acuity or color perception can be discussed in the light of two conceptual models of perceptual processing. One model suggests the representation of different visual functions within one neuronal network, each function represented by a different number of neurons or a different algorithm within the network. The second model suggests a spatial segregation of different visual functions in different cortical areas that receive input from one common structure, presumably the striate cortex.
