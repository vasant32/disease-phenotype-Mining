We report an unusual etiology for a thromboembolic complication. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery occurred before embolization of an intracranial aneurysm. Attempts to recanalize the artery failed by using both fibrinolytics and IIb/IIIa inhibitors but succeeded with mechanical thrombectomy with a micro-snare. Pathologic analysis of the thrombus showed numerous synthetic fibers that were determined to have originated from unsealed gauze that was used during the procedure.
