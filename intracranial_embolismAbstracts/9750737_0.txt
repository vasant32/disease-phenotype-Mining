Central venous catheters are usually inserted and manipulated by anaesthetists-intensivists and others familiar with their use under surgical conditions, yet they are often removed on the wards by junior doctors or nurses insufficiently trained in the removal procedure. In order to illustrate the risks presented by such a practice, we report a case of cerebral air embolism following the withdrawal of an internal jugular catheter in a sitting patient. The mechanisms of air entry into the venous and systemic circulation are considered, as well as the preventive and therapeutic measures.
