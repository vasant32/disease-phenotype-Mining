Clinical features of thalamic strokes have not been well delineated in children. Six children with ischemic thalamic infarcts (3 M, 3 F; age range: 21 months to 14 1/2 years) are reported. Three patients had infarction in the thalamoperforate artery territory and all had a decreased level of consciousness and hemiparesis; two of them also had associated ocular motility abnormalities. One patient with left thalamotuberal artery stroke presented with aphasia. Two patients with thalamogeniculate artery infarcts had hemiparesis and involvement of the posterior cerebral artery. Etiologic factors in our patients were: infectious vasculitis, congenital heart disease, migraine, and unknown in 1 patient each and trauma in 2 patients. Follow-up information was available for 5, 4 of whom recovered completely. One patient was left with a neurologic deficit. We conclude that the prognosis of ischemic thalamic strokes in children is relatively good.
