The authors report both Senegalese's cases of subvalvular left ventricular aneurysm (SVLVA). The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and paraclinical aspects of this disease. Mitral regurgitation an heart failure were constant. Beyond cardiomegaly observed in both patients, one of them presented vaulting of the left ventricle. In the two cases, electrocardisgram showed sinus rhythm, and biology an inflammatory syndrome. One patient had also tuberculosis. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an aneurysm situated in a mitral subvalvular position, thrombosed in one case. Medical treatment with furosemid and digoxin has been administrated. One patient received also drugs against tuberculosis. Surgery of aneurysm had not been possible. During the evolution, we have observed persistence of heart failure in one patient. The other one died, probably after a cerebral embolism. Autopsy confirmed the echocardiographic aspects and integrity of myocardium and coronary arteries.
