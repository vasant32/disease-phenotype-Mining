The canine middle cerebral artery (MCA) was embolized with a pliable cylinder 8 mm long by 1.6 mm in diameter via the internal carotid artery. Both control and experimental embolectomies were performed 6 hours following embolization. The experimental animals were treated with low molecular weight dextran (LMD). In the control animals, the average volume of infarction in the brain was 1.45 cm.3 In the experimental animals the average volume of infarction was 0.13 cm.3
