A 53-year-old woman had a left hemiplegia with suspicion of cerebral metastases. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography revealed renal and splenic infarction features and she presented violaceous papulosis on her fingers corresponding to thrombosis of dermal vessels. Echocardiography showed a left atrial tumor evoking myxoma. The clinical features of left atrial myxomas are intracardiac obstruction, extracardiac embolism and general symptoms. Cutaneous manifestations are frequently reported and can correspond to cutaneous manifestations of emboli, symptoms related to auto-immune disorders and specific cutaneous findings that suggest atrial myxoma as part of more complex syndromes.
