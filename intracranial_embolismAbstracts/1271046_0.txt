The analogy between the "failure-to-thrive" syndrome of childhood and a symptom complex seen in adult neurology is described. Adults presenting with a variety of central nervous system diseases occasionally seem to follow an unusual stereotyped course resulting in intractable weight loss, wide variations in temperature, and a tendency to intractable decubitus ulcerations in a setting of decreased levels of consciousness. Sudden death occurs unexpectedly. This syndrome can be observed following cerebral thrombosis, traumatic encephalopathy, degenerative central nervous system disorders, and encephalitis. The pathophysiology is thought to result from the random aggregate of lesions rather than a verifiable discrete hypothalamic deficit.
