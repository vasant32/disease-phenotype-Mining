The authors determined the platelet aggregation(PA) activity respectively with electric impedance and photoelectric turbidimetry in patients with ischemic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases associated with blood stasis. The results showed the PA activities were elevated both in whole blood and plasma. Then, the authors detected simultaneously the PA activity and amount of post-aggregation beta-thromboglobulin(beta-TG) releasing and also in vivo amount of spontaneous plasma releasing of beta-TG with photoelectric turbidimetry and RIA methods with blood stasis. The results showed, during the acute phase of stroke, a high activated state of platelet existed, expressed as significant elevation both of the amount of beta-TG releasing of post-aggregation and plasma beta-TG level. However, no definite correlation between rate of PA and subsequent amount of beta-TG releasing was found, and detection of aggregation rate alone did not disclose the state of activation. As compared with the acute phase, during the recovery stage of stroke in which the clinical symptom of blood stasis was improved, the plasma beta-TG level declined significantly, however, was still higher than in normal controls; amount of releasing beta-TG was declining which denoted that the platelet functions were reducing then, but were still in a higher state of activation. These results suggested that there were changes both in number and quality of platelet in patients with blood stasis.
