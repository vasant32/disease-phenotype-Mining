Techniques for transcatheter aortic valve implantation involve manipulation of the native aortic valve and the aortic arch. As a result, excellent technical outcomes of this technique remain counterbalanced by a level of neurologic complications that remain unacceptably high. We present here a report of a new potential combined approach to reduce periprocedural neurologic events. After a 6-cm J-shaped upper-mini-sternotomy, 26-mm Sapien valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) was deployed through a transaortic approach. In addition, the Embol-X device (Edwards Lifescience) was directly inserted in the distal ascending aorta was deployed during all the procedure. Postoperative evolution was clinically uneventful. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed no new ischemic lesions in this first patient.
