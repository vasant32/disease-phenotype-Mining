OBJECTIVE: To study the antithrombotic effects of Holothuria Ldeucospilota Acidic Mucopolysaccharide (HLAM). METHODS: A series of variables were observed before and after treatment with HLAM in normal middle-aged subjects and patients recovering from cerebral embolism or suffering from ischemic heart disease, each of which were divided into two groups according to the dosage administered (60 mg/d and 120 mg/d). RESULTS: The fat metabolism was enhanced in addition to the anticoagulant and the blood viscosity reducing effects. No side-effect was found. CONCLUSION: HLAM is a promising drug for antithrombotic therapy.
