Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and brain edema are life-threatening complications of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA)-induced reperfusion after ischemic stroke. The risk of HT limits the therapeutic window for reperfusion to 3 h after stroke onset. Pre-treatment with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors reduces HT and cerebral edema in experimental stroke. However, whether a delayed therapeutic intervention would be beneficial is unknown. In this study, 215 male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to embolic stroke and 75 rats were included in the final analysis. The animals were treated with the MMP inhibitor p-aminobenzoyl-gly-pro-D-leu-D-ala-hydroxamate before or after 3 or 6 h of ischemia. Animals were monitored for reperfusion and received rt-PA 6 h after ischemia onset. The results at 24 h showed that MMP inhibition 3 h after ischemia significantly decreased the degree of brain edema (17% of hemispheric enlargement in the treated group versus 24% in controls, P=0.018), reduced the risk (OR=0.163; 95% CI: 0.029 to 0.953) and gravity (0.09 versus 0.19 mg of parenchymal hemoglobin, P=0.02) of intracerebral hemorrhage, and improved neurological outcome (20% of the treated animals had a slight deficit; all of the controls had a bad outcome, P<0.05). Delaying MMP inhibition to 6 h after ischemia restricted the beneficial role of the treatment to a reduction in the risk of parenchymal hemorrhage (OR=0.242; 95% CI: 0.060 to 0.989). Our results confirm the involvement of MMPs in HT and support the possibility of extending the therapeutic window for thrombolysis in stroke by administering a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor after the onset of ischemia.
