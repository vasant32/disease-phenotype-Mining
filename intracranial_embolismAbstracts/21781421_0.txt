Cardiac involvement is an uncommon complication of echinococcosis. It is usually asymptomatic and may only be diagnosed incidentally. A 7-year-old boy was admitted with acute stroke and bullous and ulcerated skin lesions. He was diagnosed with cardiac echinococcosis complicated by systemic emboli to the central nervous system and superficial cutaneous arteries. In endemic areas, echinococcosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cardiac disease and unexplained cerebral embolism.
