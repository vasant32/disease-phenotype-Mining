A patient in whom transesophageal echocardiography was performed to evaluate a possible source of cerebral embolization. The fact that the probe could not be passed easily beyond 35 cm from the incisors suggested esophageal obstruction or compression. A mass was seen posterior to the left atrium that was heterogenous and contained blood vessels, suggesting a malignancy. There were no complications of the procedure. Esophageal adenocarcinoma was confirmed on biopsy. Transesophageal echocardiography may be diagnostic of paracardiac mediastinal masses, both benign and malignant. Great care must be taken if passage of the probe through the esophagus is met with resistance, to avoid serious complications.
