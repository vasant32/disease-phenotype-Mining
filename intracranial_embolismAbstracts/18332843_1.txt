INTRODUCTION: Papillary fibroelastoma is the most common primary cardiac valvular tumor. Historically, papillary fibroelastoma was an incidental autopsy finding, deemed to have no clinical significance. More recently, reports of symptomatic cases of papillary fibroelastoma with complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke suggest it should be considered a potentially dangerous lesion. In this report, we describe the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 3 patients with cardiac papillary fibroelastoma who presented with cerebral vascular events. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 3 patients with cardiac papillary fibroelastoma (CPF) who presented cerebral vascular events. METHODS: Describe the findings of 3 patients and review of the literature. RESULTS: We report 3 cases with cerebral ischemic events associated with the presence of CPF that were confirmed by histopathological examination. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiogenic embolism is recognized increasingly as an important cause of stroke, accounting of 20% of ischemic strokes. Cardioembolic stroke is largely preventable. The likelihood of recurrence is relatively high for most cardioembolic sources and therefore secondary stroke prevention is fundamental. TEE allowed to characterize well-established sources of embolism, and it was the best diagnostic approach in our patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in 1 of these patients, while it confirmed the presumptive diagnosis of cardiac tumor. The first-choice treatment of symptomatic CPF is surgical excision which must be performed as early as possible to reduce the risk of early recurrences of embolic events. The use of TEE in the evaluation of cerebral vascular events is not routinely performed, this method must be considered in patients for whom the cause of cerebrovascular ischemia is unclear, after noninvasive neurovascular studies.
