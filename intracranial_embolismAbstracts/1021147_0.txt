The authors discuss the importance of neurological complications of rheumatic disease, which differ from those of Sydenham's chorea: encephalitis; acute cerebral circulatory insufficiency of cardiovascular basis; thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage; cerebral emboli; and vasculitis. The case of a 13 year old boy who presented with an acute cerebral episode during an active phase of rheumatic fever is described. The E.E.G. showed a right hemisphere disturbance with a slight involvement of the controlateral hemisphere. The cardiac evidence was indicative of a rheumatic carditis. The clinical progress and EEG were rapidly favourable. The possible pathogenetic hypotheses of this case are taken into consideration, and the authors suggest that one must suspect a rheumatic etiology when an acute cerebral syndrome is established in a child or a young adult with current or previous rheumatic fever.
