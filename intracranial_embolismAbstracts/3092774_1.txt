The consequences of pregnancy, abortion or tubal ligature were studied in 11 women with the Eisenmenger syndrome. Seventeen cases of pregnancy and 7 tubal ligatures were reviewed. In the 4 pregnancies continued of term and preceded by cardiac catheterisation, there were two maternal deaths on the 2nd and 7th day of the postpartum period due to pulmonary embolism confirmed in one case and suspected in the other. A third pregnancy was complicated by cerebral embolism and one case of tubal ligature was complicated by non-fatal pulmonary embolism. These cases were compared with previous reports in the literature to form a total of 42 cases of pregnancy in women with the Eisenmenger syndrome. The pregnancies were characterised by aggravation of dyspnoea and cyanosis in 72.4 p. cent of cases, by documented pulmonary embolism in 7 cases and by toxaemia of pregnancy in 26 p. cent of cases. The global mortality was 36 p. cent and all deaths but one occurred between the time of labour and the 11th postpartum day. Micro pulmonary thromboses were the commonest cause of death. Two mechanisms seem to combine to aggravate the cardiac status at the end of pregnancy and during the initial postpartum period: increased right-to-left shunt due to a rise in pulmonary resistances, due particularly to changes in coagulability favored by pregnancy; increased right-to-left shunt due to a decrease in systemic vascular resistances. A number of poor prognostic factors were identified: decreased oxygen saturation in arterial blood and toxaemia of pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
