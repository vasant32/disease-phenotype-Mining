We examined 5-hydroxytryptamine-like immunoreactive cerebrovascular nerve fibers in rats after experimental thromboembolic stroke. Although there were no visible 5-hydroxytryptamine-like immunoreactive nerve fibers in normal animals, we found many of these fibers near the clot emboli 30 min after the stroke, and the number of fibers increased slightly with time. In immunohistochemical double staining, these fibers corresponded to neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactive nerve fibers. And they were not observed in animals after superior cervical ganglionectomy. These findings suggest that the sympathetic nerves take up serotonin released from intraluminal aggregating platelets.
