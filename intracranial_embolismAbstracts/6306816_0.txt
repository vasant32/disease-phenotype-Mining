A lymphography was performed as a diagnostic procedure in a 69-year-old female patient hospitalized for protracted fever. Akinetic mutism with left hemiparesis occurred 10 minutes after the injection of ultrafluid lipiodol. The patient died 13 days later. Neurologic complications of lymphography are extremely rare but may be life-threatening. Speculations as to the mechanisms which may be responsible for these complications, through a modification of the usual distribution of the contrast media, include lymphovenous shunts, lymphatic vessel compression or obstruction, pulmonary arteriovenous shunts and right-to-left intracardiac shunts. These mechanisms may facilitate cerebral embolization of the contrast media. Indications of lymphography must be restricted in patients with patent lymphatic obstruction.
