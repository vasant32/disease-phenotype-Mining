Recently, patent foramen ovale(PFO) has been highlighted as an important risk factor of cerebral infarctions in young adults. We report a patient of multiple cerebral embolism associated with PFO and deep venous thrombosis caused by a uterine myoma. A 40-year-old woman suddenly suffered from right hemiparesis with motor aphasia. Brain angiography showed an occlusion of M2 portion of the left middle cerebral artery, but atherosclerotic changes were not seen. She developed left facial paresis 23 days later and admitted to our hospital. Brain MRI revealed multiple cerebral infarcts in the left insular cortex, the deep white matter of the right frontal lobe, and bilateral thalamus. Hypoxia with the perfusion defects of S1 and S2 sections of the right lung demonstrated by scintigraphy suggested pulmonary embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a PFO with spontaneous left-to-right shunt and right-to-left shunt evoked by the Valsalva maneuver. Although venography could not detect thrombi, it revealed severe compression of the right external iliac vein by a uterine myoma. These findings suggested thrombi in the right external iliac vein were the embolic source when combined with elevated coagulation markers. An uterine myoma should be considered as an important risk factor for an embolic source in case of cerebral embolism with PFO.
