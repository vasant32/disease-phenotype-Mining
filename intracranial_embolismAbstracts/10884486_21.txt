BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low-molecular-weight heparins and heparinoids (LMWHs) are superior to unfractionated heparin in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and acute coronary syndromes. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the safety and efficacy of LMWH in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Randomized, controlled, and nonconfounded trials of LMWH in acute ischemic stroke were identified from the Cochrane Library (version 2, 1999), previous systematic reviews, and a review of publication quality relating to acute stroke trials. The authors each independently extracted data by treatment group and assessed trial quality using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. RESULTS: Eleven completed RCTs involving 3048 patients were identified; data were available from 10 of these. Four trials explicitly excluded patients with presumed cardioembolic stroke. Treatment with LMWH was associated with significant reductions in prospectively identified deep vein thrombosis (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.96) and symptomatic pulmonary embolism (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69) and with increased major extracranial hemorrhage (OR 2.17, 95% 1.10 to 4.28). Nonsignificant increases in end-of-treatment (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.69) and end-of-trial (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.32) case fatality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0. 95 to 3.31) were observed. End-of-trial death and disability was nonsignificantly reduced (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06). CONCLUSIONS: ++LMWHs reduce venous thromboembolic events in patients with acute ischemic stroke and increase the risk of extracranial bleeding. A nonsignificant reduction in combined death and disability and nonsignificant increases in case fatality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were also observed. On the basis of the current evidence, LMWH should not be used in the routine management of patients with ischemic stroke.
