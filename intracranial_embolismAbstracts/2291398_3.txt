In a prospective population-based study rehabilitation outcome and achieved health quality was followed in consecutive hospitalized stroke patients after 3, 6 and 12 months. The study group comprised 258 patients (125 men and 133 women) admitted during the period February 1st 1986-January 31st 1987. Most (76%) had major stroke and 24% had minor stroke. Stroke occurred predominantly among the elderly; 74% were greater than or equal to 70 years and 38% greater than or equal to 80 years. The case-fatality rate was 11% during the acute phase and 27% after one year. Of all patients 49% returned to their own homes, 2% moved into an old people's home and 38% were referred to institutions. Age of the patient and severity of the stroke influenced on the survival rates and on the discharge pattern. The amount of patients living in their own homes increased steadily with time. At discharge and after 3, 6 and 12 months 49, 54, 58, 56% of all patients and 54, 66, 73 and 77% of the survivors respectively were living at home, whereas 38, 22, 15 and 10% of all patients and 43, 27, 19 and 14% of the survivors were in institutions at the corresponding time periods. The remaining survivors were living in an old people's home. The major recovery of functional ability occurred within the first 3-6 months. At 3, 6 and 12 months 80, 82 and 81% of the surviving patients were able to walk indoors independently.
