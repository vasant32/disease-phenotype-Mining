 OBJECTIVE: To observe the outcome of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) in patients with rheumatic mitral valve stenosis. METHODS: From April 1992 to November 2008, 1768 patients underwent PBMV in our hospital.Clinical and echocardiographic follow up data were analyzed in 426 patients from April 1992 to August 1998. Left atrial pressure and the mitral valve gradient (MVG) were measured before and immediately after PBMV in all patients. RESULTS: PBMV was successful in 1748 out of 1768 patients (98.86%). Left atrial pressure decreased from (38 +/- 7) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) to (12 +/- 4) mm Hg (P < 0.001), MVG decreased from (28 +/- 6) mm Hg to (8 +/- 3) mm Hg (P < 0.001) and the area of the mitral valve increased from (0.98 +/- 0.26) cm(2) to (1.97 +/- 0.39) cm(2) (P < 0.001) post PBMV. The main complications included death (n = 2), acute pericardial effusion (n = 1), severe mitral regurgitation (n = 12), cerebral embolism (n = 2) and pulmonary edema (n = 1). Ten years follow up was finished in 426 patients and 288 patients (67.6%) were still in NYHA class Ior II without mitral valve replace operation or repeated PBMV, restenosis was evidenced in 140 patients (33.3%) and 31 patients dead (7.5%). CONCLUSION: PBMV was an effective therapy option for patients with rheumatic mitral valve stenosis.
