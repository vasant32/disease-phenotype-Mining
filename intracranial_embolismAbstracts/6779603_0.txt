Six patients with neurovascular disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) illustrate the diversity of neuroradiologic changes in that condition. Emphasis is placed on the involvement of large cerebral vessels, especially as reflected by cerebral vein or sinus occlusions. The latter occurred in four of the six cases reported; deep or superficial veins, larger lobar draining veins such as the superficial middle cerebral vein, or large bore vessels such as the superior sagittal sinus or jugular bulb were involved. Radionuclide sinography or computed tomography (CT) was useful in revealing large vessel occlusions or their sequelae; in two cases CT showed focal hemorrhage in an unusual location. Although DIC has classically been envisioned as occurring within the arterial microcirculation, these cases attest to the occurrence of large vessel, especially venous, involvement in neurovascular DIC.
