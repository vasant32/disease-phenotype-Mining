On the basis of the medical reports of 255 patients with an acute cerebral insult the clinical symptoms, the courses of the illness as well as the diagnostic procedure were discussed. 76 of 255 patients (29.8%) are taken ill before they reach their 65th year, which stresses the sociomedical importance of acute cerebrovascular syndromes. With patients under 65 years the clinical syndrome corresponds to the following stages of the cerebrovascular insufficiency: stage IIa-14.5%, stage IIb-43.4%, stage III and IV-36.8%. A brain embolism is found in 5.3% of the cases. If there is an acute cerebrovascular insufficiency the ultrasonic Doppler detection as a noninvasive procedure should be the beginning of the paraclinical diagnosis. Should the ultrasonic Doppler detection give an indication of extracranial stenosis or obstruction of the A. carotis, then an angiographic diagnosis ought to be started in order to make possible a surgical treatment of the A. carotis.
