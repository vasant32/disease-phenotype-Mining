A 65-year-old woman experienced sudden positional vertigo with rightward, horizontal nystagmus that resolved within days. MRI revealed a left parietal lobe infarction involving the supramarginal gyrus. The patient experienced a transient recurrence of vertigo after 7 days but MRI failed to reveal the presence of any new lesions; furthermore, the patient's EEG was normal. We suggest that this patient's vertigo was due to her parietal cortical infarction.
