In 101 patients treated for epilepsy electroencephalographic and scintigraphic investigations were carried out. In 93 cases the results of EEG investigations were abnormal, in 8 normal. Scintiscanning demonstrated presence of focal pathological changes in 20 cases, in 81 cases the scans were normal. The highest proportion of concordant results was obtained in cases with focal EEG changes -- 50% while in all cases of symmetrical seizure activity in EEG the scientiscans were normal. The combination of both methods increases the possibility of early diagnosis in cases with symptomatic epilepsy.
