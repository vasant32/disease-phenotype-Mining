Pulmonary and cerebral lipiodol embolism after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma is rare. To our knowledge, only 7 cases have been reported in the literature. We present a case of pulmonary and cerebral lipiodol embolism, and analyzed retrospectively the imaging and clinical data of the patient and conclude the most probable mechanism of pulmonary and cerebral lipiodol embolism, which is different from that of the cases reported previously.
