An unusual presentation of fat embolism is reported. Forty-eight hours after severe trauma to her legs the patient became stuporous and her right arm weak. A computerized tomography scan showed diffuse brain swelling. Although the petechiae, thrombocytopenia and lipuria characteristic of the fat embolism syndrome were present, at no time was there any evidence of pulmonary involvement.
