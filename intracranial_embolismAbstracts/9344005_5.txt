Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect ischemia within minutes of onset, but its ability to reliably detect hyperacute cerebral hemorrhage is unknown. The present study characterized diffusion-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI appearances of hemorrhagic transformation within 5 hours of onset in experimental embolic stroke. Apparent diffusion coefficients and MRI signal characteristics were noted within corresponding regions of hemorrhage observed on gross pathology. Apparent diffusion coefficients were significantly increased within hemorrhagic lesions, but were still within the expected range for bland ischemia. The appearance of the hemorrhagic lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI was also very heterogeneous and not very useful for clinical screening. Other MRI modalities should be investigated, but computed tomography remains the only widely available clinical method of reliably detecting cerebral hemorrhage.
