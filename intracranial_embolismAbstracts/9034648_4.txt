Papillary fibroelastomas are rare and normally benign cardiac tumors typically attached to cardiac valves. This report describes two patients who were evaluated for intermittent dyspnea in one case and for the source of cerebral embolism in the other. In both patients transthoracic echocardiography revealed a pedunculated mobile mass adjacent to an atrioventricular valve, suggestive of papillary fibroelastoma. Postoperative histology was confirmatory of papillary fibroelastoma with a typical hyalinized hypocellular stroma covered by a single layer of endocardial cells.
