Case IJ shows impaired capacity to repeat individual words despite normal hearing as measured by audiometry and tympanometry. She also has difficulty in identifying other environmental sounds. Her phonological memory span for visually-presented material is normal, and her memory span for spoken digits is only slightly impaired. It is suggested that she has a pre-phonological auditory processing deficit; the implications of this for discussion of the role of phonological short-term memory in language processing are discussed.
