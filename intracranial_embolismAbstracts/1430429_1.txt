Cortical brain lesions were identified on MRI and CT in 14 patients with a variety of diseases. Each of these patients developed neurologic symptoms, the most prominent of which were seizures, depressed mental status, and blurred vision or cortical blindness. Both the imaging and the neurologic abnormalities resolved spontaneously within a period ranging from 5 to 30 days. Due to location and evolution of the lesions over time we hypothesize that they are secondary to small cortical venous thromboses.
