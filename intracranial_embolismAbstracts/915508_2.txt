In 34 patients who presented with attacks of amaurosis fugax with no evidence of cerebral involvement, EEG, angiographic, and regional cerebral blood flow studies were carried out. Six of 23 EEGs, one of 21 angiograms, and five of six regional blood flow studies were thought to provide evidence of silent cerebral embolism. The implications for the management of patients who present with isolated amaurosis fugax are discussed.
