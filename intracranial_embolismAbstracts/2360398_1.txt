A prospective study on 386 consecutive patients affected of ischemic stroke (IS) has been analysed in relation to etiologies, comparing them with a control group of 100 people. The atherotrombotic etiology subgroups are associated with family history of stroke, risk factors, atheromatosis, occlusive peripheral arteriopathy, previous of stroke, high levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin, impaired lipid fractions and high levels of uric acid. The cardiac embolism etiology subgroups are associated with the presence of personal history of stroke, just as the mitral valva prolapse (MVP) patients group. The migraine group is significantly related with the intake of oral contraceptives.
