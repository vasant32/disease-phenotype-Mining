An infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory in a 9 months old girl occurred in the course of Kawasaki's disease which in addition had induced a coronary aneurysm and a myocardial infarct. Embolism from the myocardial infarct was likely to have provoked the cerebral infarction. Neurological symptoms and signs are unusual in Kawasaki's disease.
