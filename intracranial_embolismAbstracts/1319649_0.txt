Clinical and morphological studies were carried out in 194 patients who died in the acute period of ischemic brain stroke. Disorders of the heart rhythm were found to play the leading part in the origin of cardiogenic embolisms of cerebral vessels. It has been recorded that left atrial thrombus formation was prevalent in heart rhythm disorders whereas left ventricular was prevalent in lack of those disorders. In different heart diseases complicated by atrial fibrillation and cerebral thromboembolism, the one-third of cases did not show any heart thromboses. The content of embolisms in cerebral arteries corresponded to the material of their source, whereas the site was specified by mechanical obstruction, with no changes in the vascular wall. It has been disclosed that in the majority of cases, stable embolism precipitates white infarction or white infarction with the hemorrhagic component whereas embolus lysis is responsible for hemorrhagic infarction and (or) a transitory ischemic attack. The clinical manifestations of hemorrhagic infarction differ from white infarction in less gravity and regression of the neurological symptomatology.
