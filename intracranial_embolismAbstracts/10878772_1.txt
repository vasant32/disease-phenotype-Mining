Blood flow velocities in the basal cerebral arteries were evaluated in 41 patients with supratentorial arteriovenous malformation (AVM), using a transcranial doppler 64-B instrument. The AVM was surgically excised in 20 patients and embolised in 21 patients. Blood flow velocities in feeding basal cerebral arteries were found markedly decreased in both the groups, at 24 hours after intervention. On follow up study at 3 months, blood flow velocity in feeding cerebral artery was found to be increased in 47 percent of patients who were embolised, but remained normal in all the patients who underwent surgery.
