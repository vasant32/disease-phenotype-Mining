The long-term course (mean 15 years) of 336 patients with valvular incompetence who underwent Starr-Edwards ball valve implantation between 1962 and 1971 was reviewed. Eighteen patients (10%) with aortic valve replacement and 24 (16%) with mitral valve replacement died early postoperatively. Mortality remained high (31%) in the first 3 years after aortic valve replacement; it was highest (13%) in the first year after mitral valve replacement and then approached the normal rate. The most common mode of death was sudden death after aortic and cardiac failure after mitral valve replacement. At follow-up, 76% of survivors had improved symptomatically. Three instances of primary valve malfunction occurred. The probability of freedom from thromboembolism at 15 years postoperatively was 56% for aortic valve replacement and 52% for mitral valve replacement. The Starr-Edwards valve prosthesis is durable over prolonged follow-up period, but thromboembolism remains a persistent problem. Survival may be normal for patients surviving the early postoperative years.
