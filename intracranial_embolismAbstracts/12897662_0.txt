Tc-99m HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography was performed in a patient who had experienced aphasia for 3 days. The patient had a medical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage. Both of these hemorrhages were related to a dural arteriovenous malformation that was embolized after the onset of the cerebral vascular events. Focal hyperperfusion was seen in the left temporal lobe adjacent to a perfusion defect corresponding to the old cerebral hemorrhage. The finding was interpreted as the focus of the patient's epilepsy. His aphasia resolved after the administration of anticonvulsant medication for several days.
