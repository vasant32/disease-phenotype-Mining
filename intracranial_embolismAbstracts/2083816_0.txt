We report the case of a 75 year-old woman affected by cerebral thromboembolism associated with echocardiographic detection of sessile mass in the right atrium, which presented atrial septal discontinuity. The polypous and frayed aspect of the mass and its echogenic features were consistent with floating thromboembolus and enabled it to be distinguished from other masses. Moreover, the pattern of dynamical connection with atrial septal drop-out supported the diagnosis of paradoxical embolism.
