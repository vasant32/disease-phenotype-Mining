A Gore TAG Excluder stent graft was deployed in a 35-year-old woman for an isthmic saccular aneurysm. At 12-hour follow-up, we diagnosed a proximal collapse. A Palmaz stent was used to reopen the proximal segment. Two months later, she presented with a transient ischemic attack (embolic process) related to a suboptimal apposition of the Palmaz stent in the distal aortic arch. This led to open surgical replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch with reimplantation of the supraaortic branches. Reopening of a stent graft collapse with a Palmaz stent might be a short-term solution; however, its presence can lead to embolic complications.
