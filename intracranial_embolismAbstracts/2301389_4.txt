The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by profound changes in the turnover and concentration of most plasma proteins, including those involved in the coagulation pathways. Thromboembolic complications, especially venous, have been widely reported. Arterial thrombosis is a relatively rare complication and has been reported mainly in nephrotic children. In this report, an adult nephrotic patient who developed thromboses of his right middle cerebral and left femoral arteries is described. The patient died, and at postmortem no underlying arterial disease was found. Histology of the kidneys showed minimal change disease.
