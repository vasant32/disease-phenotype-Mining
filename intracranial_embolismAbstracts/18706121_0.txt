 A myxoma is the most common primary tumor of the heart. It has been reported as the source of a cardiogenic embolism. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to detect the myxoma early via echocardiography to prevent complications, such as syncope, sudden death, and cerebral embolic ischemic stroke. This report presents the case of a 54-year-old female whose clinical manifestation of atrial myxoma was an ischemic stroke. Atrial myxoma was later confirmed as the cause of her symptoms via transesophageal echocardiography.
