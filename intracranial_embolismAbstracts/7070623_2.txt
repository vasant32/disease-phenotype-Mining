The authors report a case of thrombosed vein of Galen aneurysm in a 4.5-year-old girl with craniofacial dysostosis (Crouzon's disease). Six previously reported cases appear in the literature. The initial presentation is often associated with the symptoms and signs of hydrocephalus. Computed tomography shows an enhancing mass in the region of the posterior 3rd ventricle with the characteristic "target sign." Arteriography of all aspects of both the anterior and the posterior cerebral circulation is essential. Surgical results in cases of vein of Galen aneurysm have generally been poor, but recent reports of successful operative intervention to treat the thrombosed variety promise satisfactory treatment.
