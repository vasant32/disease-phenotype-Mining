In "pure word deafness" after acquired brain injury, the auditory comprehension of words is much more impaired than other aspects of communication or cognition. Two cases are presented, one early and one late presentation. The key to diagnosis of communication disorders is to remember to assess all six basic aspects of language function and to be vigilant for coexisting diagnoses that can complicate such assessment (especially psychiatric diagnoses). Rehabilitation management of impaired communication should emphasize the teaching of specific coping mechanisms to the patient and to all others who are involved.
