Thirty-two patients aged 60 or less with brain infarction were examined with regard to possible changes in lipoprotein pattern as compared with a reference group. Except for a lower concentration of total lipids, cholesterol and high-density lipoproteins in the female patients, no difference was demonstrated in the two groups. In all patients a significant reduction in total lipids, cholesterol, triglyceride and all lipoproteins was demonstrated after the acute cerebrovascular accident presumedly due to the stress situation.
