The response to various drugs was studied in relation to intracranial vascularization under ultrasound control. The investigation was made in 461 patients (258 females and 203 males) aged between 18 and 87 years. Vasoactive substances interacting with the synaptic neurotransmitters metabolism directly or via CNS were used: papaverine, vincamine, sadamin, nicergoline, carbocromen, clonidine, captopril, magnesium sulphate, nifedipine, piracetam, nicotine, caffeine, dipyridamole, histamine, fentanyl. The normal arterial response was compared with the response of the involved atherosclerotic artery or with congenital malformation. The tests value in the diagnosis of neurologic vascular diseases is discussed.
