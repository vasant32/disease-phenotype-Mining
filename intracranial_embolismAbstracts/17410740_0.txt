The fungal etiology of the native aortic endocarditis is a rare situation. Most often the etiologic factors are medical manoeuvres like cardiovascular surgery (cardiac prosthesis), cardiac defibrillators or stimulators, the prolonged use of the intravenous catheters, antibiotics, immunosuppressors, etc. We are presenting the case of a patient with cardiac stimulator, with rare fungal native aortic endocarditis, complicated with cerebral embolization, in which we have chosen a combined therapy: aortic replacement with biologic prosthesis and pre and post operative anti fungal therapy. We are considering that in this case the combined medico-surgical therapy was the right choice.
