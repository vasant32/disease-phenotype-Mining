Difficulties in producing temporary cerebral ischemia in experimental animals have delayed the study on the prevention and treatment of cerebral infarction. Although occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in dog proved to be fruitless, we eventually succeeded in producing focal cerebral infarction by temporary occlusions of brain arteries. Infarction confined to the anterior portion of the thalamus was obtained by simultaneous occlusion of four arteries for 60 or 120 minutes: internal carotid, anterior cerebral, middle cerebral and posterior communicating arteries. This experimental model in dogs is unique, since a marked infarction can be seen in high frequency, and the dogs can be managed for sufficient periods after temporary clipping. Consequently, it is possible to investigate cerebral infarction not only from the pathophysiological viewpoint, but also for its prevention and treatment.
