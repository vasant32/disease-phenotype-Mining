BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identification of cardioembolic stroke is often limited by the difficulties involved in the detection of thrombi or the risk factors for thrombus formation. Patients in sinus rhythm with nondiagnostic transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and without carotid artery stenosis represent a subset in whom diagnostic recommendations are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the value of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for diagnosis and therapy in this population. METHODS: Thirty patients with the characteristics described above were studied prospectively with the use of blood analysis, TTE, TEE, and Holter monitoring (in patients with atrial thrombus). RESULTS: TTE was abnormal in 16 of 30 patients, but no embolic source was identified. TEE disclosed left atrial appendage thrombus in 3 of 30 patients, atrial septal aneurysm in 2 of 30 patients, patent foramen ovale in 7 of 30 patients, and aortic plaques in 19 of 30 patients. The Tee resulted in a change of therapy in 3 of the 30 patients studied. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that TEE is a helpful diagnostic tool in delineating the risk of cardioembolic stroke and demonstrates significant pathology even in a subset of patients deemed to be at low risk. This additional new information led to a substantial change in therapy in 3 of 30 patients.
