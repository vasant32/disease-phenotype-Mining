Analysis of contemporary clinical and experimental studies evidences that intraoperative microemboli considerably contribute to the development of postoperative deliria and cognitive disorders. A number of studies have shown that left temporal and occipital structures are especially vulnerable to intraoperative ischemia. It is important that neurological cases of ischemia of the former brain regions are frequently characterized by transient psychoses and hypomnesia. Approaches to preventing intraoperative microembolism and associated neurological complications need further research.
