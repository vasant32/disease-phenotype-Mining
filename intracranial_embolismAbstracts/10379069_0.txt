A requirement for the use of TCD for the detection of emboli in the field of cardiac and vascular surgery is the reliable differentiation between true emboli and artifacts. In ten healthy volunteers we carried out a study to establish the method with which artefacts can most reliably be identified. Automatic detection of increasing signal intensity misinterpreted 14% of all artifacts as emboli; 1.7% of all artifacts sounded suspicious for embolism, and 0.6% met the classical criteria of an embolus. Using simultaneous recording of the flow signal in two sections of the middle cerebral artery, all artifacts were identified on the basis of their simultaneous manifestation. Reliable intra-operative differentiation of emboli from artifacts requires attentive, continuous acoustic and visual analysis of signals by an experienced investigator familiar with the surgical procedure. The introduction of a multiple-depth algorithm might significantly improve the automatic detection program.
