The group G streptococcal endocarditis is a rare form of infective endocarditis. In this form of infective endocarditis, serious neurological complications most commonly develop. We reported this case because of its being an unusual form of infective endocarditis that was caused by Group G Streptococcus. We also reviewed the literature. The patient was admitted to infectious disease service with a presumptive diagnosis of central nervous system infection. Blood cultures were positive for group G streptococcus. There was a mass on the posterior surface of the mitral valve which was 2 x 2.5 cm in length on the echocardiography. In the cranial computerized tomography of our patient, slightly increased contrast media uptake was observed in the both parietal lobes, in the both frontal lobes, and in the anterior areas of right occipital lobe. Therefore, this case was assumed as infective endocarditis caused by group G streptococcus with multiple cerebral emboli. Ceftriaxone was given for 4 weeks and gentamicin was given for 2 weeks, and progressive improvement of the patient's condition was seen.
