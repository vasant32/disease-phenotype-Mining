The authors present a new, unusual side effect due to retained pacemaker lead. The free tip of the lead caused cerebral embolism by perforating the interatrial septum. Transoesophageal echocardiographic study showed the lead crossing the interatrial septum. The total abnormal course of the lead was demonstrated by lateral X-ray picture. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches regarding retained leads in malposition are also discussed.
