The reliability of computerised axial tomography (CAT) in the recognition of intracranial lesions is now accepted. Apart from ventricular displacement, compression or distension, abnormal patterns in the area of a lesion may be shown on the oscilloscope display and the corresponding polaroid film, and these may show additional enhancement patterns after the intravenous injection of a contrast medium. In an attempt to assess the changes shown with gliomas, both before and after contrast enhancement, and the possible relationship to the type of glioma present, and analysis has been made of 100 consecutive histologically proven cases. Other lesions occurring during the same period as the study, and giving a similar display, are illustrated and the differential diagnosis discussed.
