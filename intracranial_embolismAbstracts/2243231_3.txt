Fifty-one patients with CCT verified cerebral infarction were submitted to serum and CSF radioimmunoassay of FSH, LH, estradiol (E2), progesterone, testosterone, cortisol and T4. The results were compared to those of 82 matched controls. Our findings suggest that (1) high serum E2 is a risk factor of stroke in males; (2) low serum T4 is a risk factor in males; (3) serum testosterone is reduced in acute stroke in males confirming that it is stress sensitive; (4) serum LH was higher in hypertensive thrombotic males when compared to normotensive ones, and (5) FSH, LH, E2 and T4 are undetectable in CSF of patients and controls.
