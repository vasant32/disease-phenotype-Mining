Seizures are one of the most frequent complications after cerebral ischemia in patients. Up to now it is unknown which mechanisms are responsible for this. As shown previously photothrombotic infarction in rat neocortex leads to a sweeping suppression of GABAergic inhibition. In this study we investigated whether and to what extent epileptiform discharges can be observed in this ischemia model. In neocortical slices from lesioned animals we did not find spontaneous epileptic activity or paroxysmal depolarisation shifts. However, ipsi- and contralateral to a photothrombotic lesion the frequency of double and multiple discharges was markedly increased when compared to unlesioned controls. Surprisingly, neither the drug lubeluzole which was has been shown to prevent the GABAergic disinhibition observed after photothrombotic lesioning of rat neocortex, nor the prevention of spreading depressions by the NMDA-receptor antagonist MK-801 during lesion induction significantly affected the frequency of epileptiform discharges. This indicates that the epileptiform discharges are probably caused by functional alterations of glutamatergic receptors.
