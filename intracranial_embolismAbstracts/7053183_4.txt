Forty right hemisphere-damaged patients and 35 normal controls were given five language tests, the Token test, a naming to description test, the Reporter's test, a word fluency test and a sentence anagram test. The sentence anagram test was the only measure on which right hemisphere patients performed significantly more poorly than control patients. It is surmised that this impairment may be indicative of a direct right hemisphere participation in linguistic performances.
