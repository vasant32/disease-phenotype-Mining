Summary: In order to predict the post-therapeutic hemorrhagic complication of interventional thrombolysis, we retrospectively examined angiographic findings and other factors in 44 patients with acute cerebral embolism. All patients were super selectively catheterized within 5 hours of onset and received a fixed regimen of urokinase or t-PA, unless recanalization was achieved or deterioration was apparent before total infusion. Immediate post-therapeutic CT scan revealed hematoma within the basal ganglia in 10 patients (group 1) and no hemorrhage in the remaining 34 (group 2). A series of angiograms during the therapy showed A-V shunt from lenticulostriate arteries to thalamostriate vein in 7 of 10 cases in group 1; no case in group 2 was accompanied by such abnormal shunt. Prognosis after the therapy was worse in group 1 than in group 2. No other factors, such as therapeutic timing after the disease onset or total doses of urokinase or t-PA infused, differed between the two groups. These findings indicate that angiographic A-V shunt during therapy is a predictive sign of a high incidence of hemorrhagic complication. We recommend performing several angiographic controls during therapy and when A-V shunt is detected, the therapy should be discontinued to prevent hemorrhage which leads to a poor prognosis.
