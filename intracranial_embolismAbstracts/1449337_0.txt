The authors report a case of thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase in the early postoperative period after aortic valve replacement with a Saint Jude medical prosthesis. After good initial progress, the patient had to be reoperated on the 12th postoperative day for sternal disunion. Reoperation was followed rapidly by progressive thrombosis of the aortic prosthesis demonstrated by repeated Doppler echocardiographic examination. The impossibility of eliminating mediastinitis led to medical thrombolysis. The outcome was favourable after a regressive cerebral embolic event. This case illustrates the value of Doppler echocardiographic examination in the postoperative period. Thrombolysis may constitute an alternative to reoperation when the operative risk is high. The risk of thrombolysis may not be as great as some believe.
