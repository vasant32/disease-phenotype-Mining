Between April 1972 and May 1990, a total of 300 patients in our institution underwent insertion of a Bj√∂rk-Shiley aortic valve prosthesis, and development of a thrombosed valve was observed only in 4 female cases. It was considered that the thrombosed valves in all 4 cases were caused by inadequacy of the anticoagulant agents. As reoperative procedures, thrombectomy, resection of the excessive granulation under the valve, and a method of turning the opening direction of the valve 180 degrees were used. These procedures were reported previously. One case died late in the day after the operation, while the remaining 3 cases progressed favorably. Although control of one of these three cases was favorably maintained after reoperation, a restriction of 43.2 degrees of the opening angle of the valve was again observed by valve-fluoroscopy performed in the 3rd postoperative year. However, progress of this patient was observed on an outpatient basis because flow velocity at the position of aortic valve was also within normal range. This was shown Doppler's test using ultrasonic waves and the patient showed no symptoms. However, this patient was admitted to our institute due to sudden right hemiplegia on May 1990 in the 5th year after reoperation. The cerebral embolism due to the recurrent thrombosed valve was diagnosed because a low density in the middle cerebral area was observed by CT, and increase of the opening angle of the valve (compared with that at ambulation) was also noted by valve-fluoroscopy. The hemiplegia remained even though this patient was saved from death. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
