A clinical case of apparent air embolism through a radial artery line served as the impetus to conduct a study in primates to investigate the possibility of air embolism from the radial artery into the cerebral circulation. Using 133Xe cerebral scanning, we demonstrated that greater than 2 ml of air in the radial artery would result in retrograde passage of air into the vertebral system and then into the brain.
