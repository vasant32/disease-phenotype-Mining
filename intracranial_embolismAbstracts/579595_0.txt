Postmortem examination of the brain of a 5-week-old boy disclosed extensive thrombosis of the deep venous system and widespread necrosis of the cerebral parenchyma. As is characteristic of this uncommon form of cerebrovascular disease, malacia was present in the central gray matter but was only focal and incospicuous in contrast to a diffuse hemorrhagic softening of the centrum semiovale. This association of deep venous thrombosis and predominant white matter necrosis suggests that impairment of venous drainage should be considered in the pathogenesis of certain disorders of the cerebral white matter.
