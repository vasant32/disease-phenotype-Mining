OBJECTIVE: Provide evidence whether there is a difference in the presence of inflammatory parameters in patients with cerebrovascular attacks (CVA) with a thrombotic etiology as compared with a CVA with an embolic etiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 45 patients with an acute CVA the level of C reactive protein (CRP) was assessed, interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and the value of the D-dimer. Patients with clinical signs of inflammation were eliminated. 21 patients had a sinus rhythm (SR) and 24 patients atrial fibrillation (AF). RESULTS: Between the group of patients with SR and AF there was no difference in age or sex distribution. The CRP concentration was in the SR group, as compared with the AF group, increased (4.67 mg/l vs. 3.65 mg/l, p = 0.043), similarly as the concentration of IL-8 (12.53 ng/l vs. 8.1 ng/l, p = 0.039). The IL-6 concentrations in the two groups did not differ (5.45 ng/l vs. 5.014 n.s.), similarly as the number of patients with elevated D-dimer values (29% vs. 35% n.s.). CONCLUSION: The assembled findings of elevated inflammatory parameters in patients with CVA of a thrombotic etiology as compared with patients with CVA with embolic etiology indicate similarly as in patients with acute coronary syndrome - the possible role of inflammation in the etiopathogenesis of thrombotic CVA. The results suggest the possible use of inflammatory markers for the differentiation of the etiology of ischaemic CVA.
