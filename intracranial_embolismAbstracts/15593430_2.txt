Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare vascular malformation of the lung which may occur as an isolated entity or in association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Because of considerable risk of serious complications such as cerebral embolism, brain abscess and pulmonary hemorrhage, definitive treatment should be considered in most patients. Embolization with coils or detachable balloons is currently the preferred treatment. Paradoxical embolization of coils and balloons may happen, especially in patients with PAVMs with large feeding arteries. In this report we present our initial experience with the use of the TriSpan coil to lower the risk of coil migration during the transcatheter occlusion of PAVMs.
