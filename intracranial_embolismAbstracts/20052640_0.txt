We report the case of a 83-year-old female patient with ST elevation myocardial infarction who developed a rectus sheath hematoma during treatment with antiplatelet medication and systemic anticoagulants following cough attacks. The patient presented with progressive pain in the left lower abdomen associated with a palpable mass and anaemia. Abdominal sonography and computed tomography revealed a rectus sheath hematoma. We discuss pathogenesis, clinical findings, diagnostic workup and therapy. Moreover, we review the current related literature.
