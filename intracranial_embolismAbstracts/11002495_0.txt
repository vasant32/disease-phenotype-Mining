An autopsy case of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissecting aneurysm due to atherosclerosis was reported. A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaints of hoarseness and a pulsatile mass below the left mandibular angle. Neurological examination showed no obvious deficits except left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Angiography revealed narrowing of the original segment of left ICA with dissection and aneurysmal dilation at the level of C3 vertebra. Seven days after admission, the patient had a sudden onset of consciousness disturbance. The second angiography showed no obvious changes compared with the first findings except slight narrowing in the distal portion above the aneurysmal dilation. The possible mechanism was thought to be recanalization following transient occlusion of the left ICA caused by extension of dissection or intracranial embolism due to a thrombus within the aneurysm. He was managed conservatively, but unfortunately he died of pneumonia. Macroscopic autopsy showed that the aneurysm was fusiform. Histologically, it demonstrated dissection of the hematoma between the media and adventitia layer. Hemorrhage in the atheromatous plaque with disruption of the elastic lamina were observed along with severe degenerative changes of the intima, media and, in part, adventitia layer due to atherosclerosis. In addition, a dissecting aneurysm of the right iliac artery and severe arteriosclerosis were observed in the systemic arteries. On the basis of these findings, the dissecting aneurysm presumably developed after disruption of a weak portion of the atherosclerotic wall, where intraplaque hemorrhage occurred earlier. We suggest that atherosclerosis be regarded as one of the pathogenic factors capable of causing dissecting aneurysm of the extracranial ICA in elderly patients.
