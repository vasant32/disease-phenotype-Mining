Balloon test occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is useful in preoperatively assessing the risk of temporary occlusion or permanent sacrifice of the carotid artery. The incidence of symptomatic complications from this procedure is 1.7%. The case is reported of a 57-year-old woman in whom a balloon test occlusion of the left ICA was attempted. She developed a left ICA dissection/occlusion with subsequent embolization to the left middle cerebral artery, leading to right-sided hemiplegia and expressive aphasia. She was successfully treated by an emergency embolectomy followed by surgical repair of the left ICA, with an excellent outcome. This case represents the most serious complication encountered by the authors in more than 300 balloon test occlusions. Means of avoiding this complication during balloon test occlusion as well as the important factors in managing this problem are emphasized.
