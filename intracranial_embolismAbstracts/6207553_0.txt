The data from an analysis of 104 patients who died in the acute stage of apoplexy are reported. A clinical anatomic and neuropsychological analysis as well as comparison with the foci of the lesions was made. The data confirmed once more the results of many authors--from Broco to recent days and showed that these areas formed the "nucleus" of the cerebral mechanism of the speech. Inspite of the fact that the speech as a function could not be localized in one area of the Central Nervous System, the so called "speech areas" of the dominant hemisphere play an important role in the functioning of the speech system--its "cerebral mechanisms" are set there.
