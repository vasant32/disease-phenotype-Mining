Sixty-four patients with pure mitral insufficiency were operated upon. Thirty of them had torn chordae tendineae. It was possible to repair the mitral valve in 57 patients and there were five operative deaths. One patient had a femoral artery embolus and another had a cerebral embolus. The incidence of peripheral embolization was 4 per cent compared with 40 per cent reported for ball valve replacement.Forty-eight of the 57 patients with repair (84 per cent) were living and well with at most a grade II/VI apical systolic murmur up to seven and a half years after operation. There has been no evidence of recurrence in these patients.In approximately 90 per cent of patients with pure mitral insufficiency, repair should be performed. When feasible, repair is more satisfactory than valvular replacement, with not only excellent long-term results, but far less morbidity than is reported with ball valve replacement.
