We describe a patient with an isolated mesencephalic dorsal tegmental infarct affecting the oculomotor nuclear complex and medial longitudinal fasciculus, documented by high-resolution computed tomography, after undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty. Clinically, the patient exhibited bilateral ptosis, bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, transient convergence retractory nystagmus, and minimal somnolence. We believe the combined clinical and radiological findings favor the presence of a caudal, dorsal, and paramedian embolic infarct in the territory of the paramedian branches of the mesencephalic artery as the most likely mechanism for these exceptional findings and correlate them with Warwick's scheme of the oculomotor subnuclei.
