Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma is characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity and dehydration in the absence of ketoacidosis. Two cases of hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, in which both the patients recovered, were presented. One of the cases was a 59-year-old female who had suffered from a metastatic brain tumor. After removal of the tumor, the patient's condition improved for a period. This was followed by a period of frequent vomiting, subsequently followed by coma. The laboratory data showed the absence of ketoacidosis in the blood sugar measured at 672 mg/dl and serum osmolarity at 343.1 mOsm./kg. The other case was a 74-year-old female who was admitted to the clinic because of cerebral thrombosis. Her caloric in-take was restricted and insulin was administered because of a mild diabetes mellitus which occured after admission. Then she entered a hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma. The laboratory data revealed blood sugar to be 1068 mg/dl and serum osmolarity to be 418 mOsm./kg. Immediately after large amounts of intravenous drip infusion and insulin were administerd, she recovered from the syndrome. The clinical observations and the pathogenesis of this syndrome were discussed.
