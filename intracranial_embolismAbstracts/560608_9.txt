The operative technique and the immediate and long-term results are described in 49 patients who have undergone myectomy for IHSS. There was a 4 percent early and 12 percent late mortality rate and surviving patients have been followed for up to 13 years. The operation has resulted in a striking symptomatic improvement in most patients in association with relief of outflow obstruction and mitral regurgitation. Chronic atrial fibrillation was poorly tolerated but has not occurred as a late complication in any of the patients operated upon.
