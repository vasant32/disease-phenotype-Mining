BACKGROUND: Distal embolization of debris during percutaneous carotid artery stenting may result in neurological deficit. Filter devices for cerebral protection potentially reduce the risk of embolization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Elective carotid stent implantation using 3 different types of distal filter protection devices was attempted in 88 consecutive lesions (84 patients) in the internal carotid artery that had >70% diameter stenosis (mean, 78.7+/-10.7%). Procedures were performed in 3 different centers. The mean age of the patients was 69+/-8 years, 75% were men, and 35.7% had neurological symptoms. In 86 lesions, a stent was successfully implanted (97.7%). In 83 of these 86 procedures (96.5%), it was possible to position a filter device. In 53% of filters, there was macroscopic evidence of debris. Collected material consisted of lipid-rich macrophages, fibrin material, and cholesterol clefts. Neurological complications during the procedure, in the hospital, and at 30 days of clinical follow-up occurred in only one patient (1.2%). This patient suffered a minor stroke that resolved within 1 week. Two major adverse cardiac events (2.3%) occurred during the 30 days of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Filter protection during carotid artery stenting seems feasible and safe. In the present series, the incidence of neurological complications was low.
