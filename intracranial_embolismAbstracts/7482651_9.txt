BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral emboli can be recognized by typical "high-intensity transient signals" (HITS) in the transcranial Doppler (TCD) spectral curves. Patients with potential cardiac sources of embolism are at higher risk for stroke. METHODS: We examined the frequency of HITS in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) with TCD over periods of 30 minutes in 100 patients having potential cardiac sources of embolism, as indicated by transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography. RESULTS: Thirty-six (36%) of the patients presented with HITS. Sex, age, sufficient anticoagulation level, antiplatelet therapy, neurological symptoms, and a history of thrombosis had no influence on the prevalence and number of HITS. The patients with a single echocardiographic diagnosis were separated into eight echocardiographically defined groups: patients with (1) atrial fibrillation, (2) coronary artery disease plus ejection fraction of more than 30% including at least three wall segments of hypokinesia/akinesia, (3) coronary artery disease with less than 30% ejection fraction, (4) dilated cardiomyopathy, (5) infectious endocarditis, (6) aortic stenosis, (7) mitral stenosis, and (8) patent foramen ovale. A significant difference in HITS occurrence could not be found in any of the defined groups. Only patients with infectious endocarditis showed a tendency for a higher HITS prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: HITS are common phenomena in patients with potential cardiac sources of embolism. The clinical relevance of these HITS remains unclear.
