Between March 1975 and March 1980, 50 patients aged 70 to 78 years underwent open-heart surgery at the Montreal Heart Institute. Coronary bypass was performed in 23 patients, valve replacement in 16 and combined coronary and valve surgery in 11. There were four early deaths, all due to cardiac causes. Early postoperative complications occurred in 58% of the patients. There were seven late deaths, five in the valve replacement groups and two in the isolated coronary bypass group. The cumulative survival rate 5 years after surgery was estimated at 76%. While 82% of the survivors were in functional class III or IV before surgery, 90% were in class I or II when last seen, after an average postoperative follow-up of 3 years. Nonfatal late complications occurred in eight of the survivors, one of whom suffered a major hemorrhage due to anticoagulant therapy. Thus, open-heart operations can be offered to the elderly, with a low risk of operative death. The late clinical improvement, with a return to a normal lifestyle, justifies a surgical approach for patients in otherwise good general condition.
