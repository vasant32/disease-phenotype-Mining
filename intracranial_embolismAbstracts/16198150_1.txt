A 64-year-old man manifested a stroke two years after restoration of sinus rhythm through a radiofrequency catheter ablation. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated the presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Left atrial volumes and different parameters of atrial emptying showed that, despite the persistence of the sinus rhythm, atrial mechanical function was severely impaired. After atrial ablation procedures echocardiography can be useful to stratify patients according to their risk of developing embolic events and hence be of help in deciding whether or not discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy is the appropriate choice.
