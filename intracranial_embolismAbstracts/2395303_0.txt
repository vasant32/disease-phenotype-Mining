The authors examined a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (Moschcowitz's disease). Six months after the patient was first seen with massive bilateral vascular occlusion, she presented with advanced retinal neovascularization in both eyes and traction retinal detachment in the left eye. While traction retinal detachment is a very rare sequela of this hematologic disorder, patients with Moschocowitz's disease should be carefully examined for early signs of ocular neovascularization in order to prevent loss of residual vision.
