A 45-year-old male, who had been indicated by brain magnetic resonance imaging to have cerebral infarctions, was found by echocardiography to have a tumor in the left atrium. He had experienced several of the constitutional disturbances associated with myxoma. At the ages of 19 and 35 he had had two episodes associated with embolisms, and at the later one he was diagnosed as having multiple cerebral aneurysms. He received an urgent operation in which three left atrial tumors and one right atrial tumor were resected. Histologically, the tumors were myxomas, and the left atrial main tumor had glandular structure. In view of his clinical history, this patient seems to have had cardiac myxomas for a long period. The multiple growths that occurred in this case may be a good argument for allowing this condition to last for so long. To our knowledge, the present case was the first report of cardiac myxoma with glandular structure in Japan.
