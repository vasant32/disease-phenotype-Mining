The indices of blood haemostasis adequately reflecting the state of coagulative, fibrinolytic, anticoagulative and platelet aggregation systems were examined in 150 patients with acute ischemic stroke. The four haemostasiological syndromes such as hyperaggregation, hypercoagulation, depressed fibrinolysis, hypercoagulation and three types of thrombophilias were distinguished and described in detail. The special features of coagulopathic disorders depending on etiology, severity and stroke onset period were characterized. The authors developed some recommendations on selective medical correction of haemostatic disorders in acute period of brain infarction.
