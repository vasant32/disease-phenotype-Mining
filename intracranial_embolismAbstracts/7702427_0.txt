The authors report the case of a woman who presented with a pulmonary embolism followed by systemic embolism. Transoesophageal echocardiography showed a persistent foramen ovale compatible with a possible paradoxical embolism. In addition, a mobile embolism in the aortic arch was demonstrated. This embolism was extracted under cardiopulmonary bypass to avoid a recurrence of embolism. Transoesophageal echocardiography is the only reliable, non-invasive method allowing simultaneous diagnosis of a right to left shunt and visualisation of the thoracic aorta.
