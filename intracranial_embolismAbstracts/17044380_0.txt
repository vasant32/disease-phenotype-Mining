Hemostatic physiology involves a complex interlinking of blood and endothelial factors. Its pharmacological manipulation invariably impacts at multiple molecular sites. Herein is reported an unusual case of coexistent warfarin-induced skin necrosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia following mitral valve replacement for thromboembolic phenomena associated with marantic endocarditis and bronchial adenocarcinoma. Thrombophilia in the face of endocarditis should be treated with a suspicion of underlying cancer.
