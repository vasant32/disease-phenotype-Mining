We report the case of a 19-year-old male who sustained an electrodynamic (16.67 Hz) high-voltage (15,000 V) railway overhead cable injury. He lost consciousness 30 minutes after contact and died secondary to brainstem herniation as a result of intracerebral swelling within 8 days. Repeated cranial computed tomography revealed a huge hemispheric mass bleeding accompanied by subarachnoidal hemorrhage. Additionally, necropsy showed an extensive thrombosis of the adjacent cerebral veins. The pathophysiological mechanism of this unusual injury is discussed.
