The clinico-anatomical analysis of 162 patients with strokes demonstrated the correlation of frequency and severity of changes in the lungs (edema-pneumonia) from the expressiveness of the secondary stem syndrome and the severity of secondary changes in the brain stem due to its dislocation, edema and disturbances of brain circulation in the brain stem substance, both in hemorrhages and strokes in the cerebral hemispheres. Pulmonary edema-pneumonia can be referred to one of the symptoms of the secondary stem syndrome developing against the background of a strong dislocation of the brain stem and accompanied by either the damages of hypothalamus nuclei or blood influence on the walls of the 3d ventricle in parenchymatous-ventricular or subarachnoid-parenchymatous hemorrhages.
