We present a case of diabetic nephrotic syndrome complicated with cerebral embolism in whom two intracardiac thrombi were found in both right and left ventricles without obvious abnormality echocardiographically. Both thrombi regressed after anticoagulant therapy. This represents an intracardiac thrombotic complication of nephrotic syndrome, presumably with hypercoagulable state as the sole mechanism of intracardiac thrombus formation.
