A 47-year-old man had an embolic stroke. Transesophageal echocardiography showed biatrial, elongated, mobile masses that appeared interconnected via a patent foramen ovale. Echocardiography did not distinguish between an interatrial clot in transit and an atypical biatrial myxoma. Surgical resection and subsequent histopathologic examination identified the mass as a biatrial myxoma. This case identifies a limitation of echocardiography in the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma.
