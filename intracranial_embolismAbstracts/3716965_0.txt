Stroke is a leading cause of maternal death. Intracerebral hemorrhage may be associated with eclampsia, metastatic choriocarcinoma or ruptured arteriovenous malformations. Intracranial venous thrombosis may result from a hypercoagulable state or local intracranial vascular damage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is usually caused by the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Signs and symptoms of stroke in pregnancy can be confusing. The physician must be aware of these signs to avoid mismanagement of the pregnant stroke patient.
