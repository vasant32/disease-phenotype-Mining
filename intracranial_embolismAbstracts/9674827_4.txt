Calciphylaxis represents a rare complication of end-stage renal disease with hyperparathyroidism. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman with systemic calciphylaxis secondary to chronic renal failure who developed mitral annular calcification and a right middle cerebral artery stroke. The high-density lesion seen on CT scan of the brain probably represents a calcified cerebral embolus originating from the mitral valve.
