Concentrations of CGRP in CSF in the patients of cerebral vascular diseases were measured by radioimmunoassay. The results showed that CGRP concentration in CSF in the patients with ischemic cerebral vascular diseases (ICVD) was 152 +/- 60 pg/ml, which was not significantly different from the control level of 45 +/- 9 pg/ml. While the CGRP concentration in CSF in the patients with hemorrhagic cerebral vascular diseases was 3965 +/- 680 pg/ml, which was significantly higher than the levels in the control group and in the ICVD group.
