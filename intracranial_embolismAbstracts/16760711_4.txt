Microembolic signals (MES) have shown to be associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients with pulsatile left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) in contrast to continuous-flow DeBakey LVAD. The pathogenesis of microembolization in LVAD-patients is still not known. We investigated whether systemic markers of inflammation or pump dynamic correlate with cerebral microembolization in nine patients with DeBakey LVAD. We performed transcranial Doppler (TCD) for MES-detection and evaluated parameters of inflammation (i.e. Leukocytes, CRP, Fibrinogen) and pump dynamic (i.e. power, speed, flow). During a mean LVAD duration of 203.7 +/- 179 days, thromboembolic events occurred in five patients with an incidence of 0.38% (approximately 0.38 events/100 LVAD-days). We performed 290 TCD monitorings with a MES mean count of 50.4 +/- 346 signals/hour (0-5042) and prevalence of 42.8%. There was no association between individual microembolic activity and the markers of inflammation or pump dynamic. In patients with DeBakey LVAD, a high load of clinically silent cerebral microemboli can be detected. However, there is no correlation between markers of inflammation or pump dynamic and the individual amount of microembolization. We hypothesize that a gaseous nature of the majority of detected microemboli in the DeBakey LVAD may be the underlying reason for this discrepancy.
