In 35 cases out of 37 (88%) microthrombi have been found in CNS. They appeared much more frequently than it could be expected on the basis of the clinical picture of DIC syndrome or changes in the coagulation system. Microthrombi occurred prevalently in white substance of the frontal and occipital lobes as well as in thalamus. In 15 cases the microthrombi were the only evidence of DIC syndrome, besides clinically "mute" one. It should be emphasized that almost in half of the cases we encountered numerous disseminated microthrombi in many regions of CNS. Unequal distribution of microthrombi in CNS points out the significance of the local factor in the pathogenesis of DIC syndrome.
