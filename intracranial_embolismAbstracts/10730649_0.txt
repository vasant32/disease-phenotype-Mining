We herein present a case of an internal carotid artery embolism associated with a hidden internal carotid artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was visualized during successful endovascular treatment of the carotid embolism. In retrospect, the aneurysm was at risk of rupture during the procedure. In the endovascular treatment of cerebral embolism, the possibility that aneurysms are hidden by emboli must be borne in mind. Care should be taken not to injure unidentified arterial walls while advancing a catheter blindly.
