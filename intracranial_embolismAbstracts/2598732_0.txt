The maximal binding capacity (Ro) and dissociation constant (Kd) of glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) in peripheral leukocytes were estimated by radioligand binding method and the plasma cortisol levels measured in 25 stroke patients (hemorrhagic 15, ischemic 10), compared with 12 healthy controls, the plasma cortisol level in stroke patients were significantly higher. The plasma cortisol level of 15 hemorrhagic and 10 ischemic stroke patients and 12 controls determined by RIA were 1.12 +/- 0.21, 0.90 +/- 0.28 and 0.45 +/- 0.09 nmol/L respectively. Ro of leukocytic GCR in hemorrhagic stroke were significantly lower than that of ischemic stroke and controls. No difference was found between ischemic stroke and controls. No difference was found between ischemic stroke and controls. Ro of GCR in 15 hemorrhagic stroke, 10 ischemic stroke patients and 12 controls were 3496 +/- 424, 5678 +/- 1101 and 5940 +/- 763 sites/cell respectively kd of GCR were 10.47 +/- 4.17, 7.01 +/- 3.24 and 5.81 +/- 1.05 nmol/L respectively. Affinity of GCR in 15 hemorrhagic stroke patients was significantly lower. In conclusion, lower number and affinity of leukocytic GCR and higher plasma cortisol level were demonstrated in hemorrhagic stroke patients, but normal number and affinity of GCR and higher plasma cortisol level in ischemic stroke patients.
