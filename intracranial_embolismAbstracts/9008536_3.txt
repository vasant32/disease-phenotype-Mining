We present a 63-year-old man who developed multiple brain infarction after ingesting a 35% hydrogen peroxide solution. Neurologic examination revealed left hemiparesis, primarily affecting the lower limb, and mild weakness of the right lower limb. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI revealed patchy bilateral brain lesions. Oxygen gas embolization is the likely cause of the brain infarctions.
