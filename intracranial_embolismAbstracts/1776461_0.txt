Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy complicated with brain cardioembolism is rarely documented by both 2-dimensional echocardiography and cranial computed tomography in pediatric patients. A 2-year-old girl developed hemiparalysis 15 months after diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The 2-dimensional echocardiograms of left ventricular thrombi, computed tomographic findings of brain embolism, clinical course, treatment and outcome are presented. Previous reports of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in children are reviewed.
