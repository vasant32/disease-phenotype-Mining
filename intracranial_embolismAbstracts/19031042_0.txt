Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a common paroxysmal disorder of episodic memory. The aetiology of TGA is still unknown. Brain ischaemia, migraine, epileptic seizure, venous congestion and psychological disturbances have been proposed as pathological mechanisms. Moreover, different precipitating events are recognised in most TGA patients including physical activity, severe emotional stress, painful experiences, immersion in cold water and sexual intercourse. We describe a 54-year-old woman who presented a TGA immediately after right-left shunt of saline contrast during the execution of transoesophageal echocardiography. Aetiopathological considerations for this uncommon presentation are discussed.
