It is shown from the analysis of 38 cases with injury to and compression of the sagittal sinus that these traumas are often attended by contusion of the brain in the sagittal-parasagittal area and are characterized by hemiparesis with predominance of motor disorders in the distal parts of the limbs, often with ischuria. They are managed surgically. Emergency surgery is indicated in hemorrhage and when there is a clinical picture of progressive compression of the brain. In the other cases trephination of the skull should be postponed until shock is completely relieved and wound infection cured and should be performed by a skilled neurosurgeon and anesthetist when a sufficient amount of stored blood is available. Compression of the sagittal sinus for a period of up to 6 weeks did not cause any clinically marked disorders of cerebral circulation.
