Pulmonary oil embolism (POE) is an extremely rare complication of hysterosalpingography (HSG). A case report of a 29-year-old woman who developed confusion and respiratory distress 12 h after HSG is presented. Intravasation of the contrast material was obvious on the HSG. High-resolution CT revealed ground-glass pattern predominantly in the lower lobes. The clinical picture and radiological findings improved on the tenth hospital day. It is believed that this is the first report of high-resolution CT findings in a case complicating HSG.
