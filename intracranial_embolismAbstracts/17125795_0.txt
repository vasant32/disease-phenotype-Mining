Spontaneous recanalization of the occluded cerebral arteries has occasionally occurred in an acute phase of stroke patients. We report a stroke patient with recanalization at 7 days of onset detected by using continuous transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring. After the presence of microembolic signals on TCD display, dynamic flow changes of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occurred, which represented recanalization of the occluded MCA.
