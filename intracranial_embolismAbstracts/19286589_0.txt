BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Unenhanced head CT has become the first line imaging study in the evaluation of suspected acute cerebral ischemia. It is important to identify subtle findings of acute ischemia on this exam to direct appropriate patient management. Summary of Case- We report the first case of multiple pial surface distal internal carotid artery territory calcified emboli causing multifocal cerebral infarctions, likely from a carotid bifurcation source. CONCLUSIONS: Visualization of multiple pial surface calcifications on unenhanced head CT, the 'salted pretzel sign', should raise suspicion for acute infarction from showered calcific emboli.
