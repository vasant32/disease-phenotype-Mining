 PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of a tailored approach to fit access and engagement techniques to the individual arch anatomy in patients with bovine-type aortic arch (BTAA) to overcome the perceived increased risk of technical failure and cerebral embolization during left internal carotid artery (LICA) stenting. METHODS: Thirty-five high surgical risk patients (23 men; mean age 68.6 years, range 62-90) with BTAA and LICA stenosis underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS). Left common carotid artery (LCCA) engagement was achieved by means of different techniques according to the configuration of the BTAA, arch type (I, II, or III), and angle between the innominate artery and the LCCA. The clinical, anatomical, and procedural data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database and analyzed retrospectively to identify technical modifications required during the procedure compared with planning. RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100%. Transfemoral access was used in 21 (60%) cases. In this group, the soft engagement technique with hockey stick (HS) guiding catheter and buddy wire in the external carotid artery (ECA) was used in 13 (62%) cases, a simple telescopic technique with 6-F armed introducer or 7-F 40Â° guiding catheter in 5 (24%) cases, and a sequential technique with a MOMA proximal protection system in the remaining 3 (14%) cases. Among the 14 (40%) right brachial access cases, the telescopic technique with 6-F armed introducer was used in 13 cases. The remaining case was the only one in which the planned technique was changed (from the telescopic to sequential technique with ECA wire exchange). There were no intraprocedural or 30-day neurological events. CONCLUSION: An appropriate tailored interventional strategy, planned by means of preprocedural recognition of bovine arch anatomy, is associated with satisfactory safety and good success.
