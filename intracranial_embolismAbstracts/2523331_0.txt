Anginal syndrome may recur early of several years after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS), and may be due to narrowing of a bypass graft, progression of pre-existing coronary artery lesions, or the appearance of new lesions. Repeat CABS is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We therefore performed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) in saphenous or internal mammary bypass grafts or native coronary arteries in 23 patients after CABS. We successfully dilated 35 of 37 lesions (95%) present in 33 of 35 vessels (94%) of 21 of 23 patients (91%). The mean vessel narrowing decreased from 86 +/- 22% to 13 +/- 19% (p less than 0.001) and in all 21 patients with angiographic evidence of success functional capacity improved. Single vein grafts were successfully dilated in 9 patients. None developed acute myocardial infarction or needed emergency surgery, but 1 had a cerebral embolism. PTCA is effective therapy for recurrent angina after CABS, and in many patients is preferable to another operation.
