OBJECTIVE: To describe the complications that occur within 30 days following the placement of a stent in the carotid artery in patients with considerable symptomatic carotid stenosis. DESIGN: Retrospective. METHOD: Data were collected on 98 patients who received a carotid stent due to symptomatic carotid stenosis of > or = 70% of the lumen at the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in the years 1999-2004. A filter, distal occlusion balloon or the Parodi anti-embolism system was used to prevent cerebral embolism. Outcome measures were complications within 30 days following intervention. RESULTS: Four patients were excluded in the period between diagnosis and stenting. Major complications occurred in 3 patients: 1 died due to cerebral haemorrhage and 2 experienced cerebral infarction. Transient neurological complications occurred in 4 patients who recovered completely. Dissection of the renal artery occurred in 1 patient, which necessitated a stent. Vascular damage of the internal carotid artery was not observed in any patient. The 3 major adverse events and 3 of the 4 minor adverse events occurred in the first 47 patients treated. None of the last 47 patients treated developed major adverse events.
