To our knowledge, the utility of coronary covered stents in the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis has not been defined in the English-language literature. Covered stents may prevent microembolic complications in select atherosclerotic carotid lesions, as they exclude the atherosclerotic lesion from the circulation by pressing the plaque against the vessel wall. Our early clinical experience has shown that use of these stents can be a therapeutic option in select cases of atherosclerotic stenosis of the cervical internal carotid artery.
