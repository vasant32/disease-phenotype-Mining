Hypodense regions demonstrated by CT within 6 hours of the onset of stroke may reflect irreversibly damaged tissue, and some have suggested that patients with such findings should be spared the risks of thrombolytic therapy since they are unable to benefit from it. We report here a patient with a low-density area demonstrated by CT less than 6 hours after onset of symptoms who improved dramatically after successful intra-arterial thrombolysis.
