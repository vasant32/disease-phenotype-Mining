OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors determining the appearance of a new cardio-embolic cerebral accident on secondary thrombophylaxis of non-valvular auricular fibrillation (NVAF). DESIGN: Controlled observational study on a series of patients treated with acenocoumarol for a period of 2.8 years. SETTING: Anticoagulation Unit of the La Paz Hospital and patients from Madrid Area 5. PARTICIPANTS: 172 patients with NVAF, over 55 and with fibrillation for at least a year, and who had suffered at least one ischaemic cerebral accident. All were treated with acenocoumarol and controlled at an INR of 2.5. The risk factors were determined and the appearance of new cardio-embolic phenomena was watched during the study period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 12 cardio-embolic phenomena were recorded (11 CVA and one peripheral embolism). The univariate study showed there was a significant association between patients who suffered a new ictus and those who suffered heart failure (p < 0.05) and had a history of more than one ictus before the start of the study (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis found that what had independent predictive value was having suffered more than one ictus. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest threat for developing a new ischaemic CVA during anticoagulation in NVAF is having a history of two or more previous ictus, as if the tendency to recur was due to these patients having more extensive atherosclerosis.
