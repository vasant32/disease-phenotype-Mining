This article reports the clinical study of 1063 patients who underwent percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy (PBMV) and 1043 patients among them who did successfully (98.2%). After the procedure, left atrial mena pressure fell from 3.19 +/- 1.06 kPa to 2.00 +/- 0.93 kPa (P < 0.001), mitral pressure gradient decreased from 2.79 +/- 1.20 kPa to 1.33 +/- 1.06 kPa (P < 0.001). Disappearance of diastolic murmur and significant improvement of cardiac function were achieved. Among the 20 failed cases, there were cardiac perforation and/or pericardial tamponade (8 cases), cerebral embolism (3 cases), severe mitral regurgitation (3 cases), atrial septal defect (2 cases) and discontinuance of the procedure due to various causes. The short-term outcome of PBMV is satisfying, so it can replace the surgical closed valvotomy as an effective treatment for selected patients with mitral stenosis.
