The study of biomarkers associated with stroke has proved to be of considerable utility. The astroglial protein S-100b is a candidate marker for cerebral tissue damage. We used a rat embolic model produced by injection of microspheres to demonstrate that serum S-100b is a useful biochemical marker for ischemic brain injury. Serum S-100b levels were significantly increased following microsphere injection, which was closely correlated with the development of brain edema. We found that structurally and mechanistically independent neuroprotective agents, such as 3-[2-[4-(3-chloro-2-methylphenylmethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dimethoxy-1-(4-imidazolylmethyl)-1H-indazole dihydrochloride 3.5 hydrate (DY-9760e), a novel calmodulin antagonist, and the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801, are capable of attenuating increased serum S-100b levels and brain edema. In contrast, the hyperosmolar agent glycerol, which has no direct neuroprotective action, had little effect on serum S-100b levels, despite a significant decrease in brain water content. These results suggest that lowering of serum S-100b is mediated by neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury. Thus, serum S-100b reflects the extent of brain damage following cerebral ischemia and serves as a useful biomarker for the assessment of neuroprotectants.
