An ex tempore mixture of fibrinogen (1%--4 ml) and 0.2 ml thrombin solutions forming a compact clot of fibrin in the subarachnoid space was introduced into the cisterna magna of dogs. To dissolve the fibrin clot 2 ml of a fibrinolysin solution with an activity of 400 units were introduced into the same cisterna 10--15 minutes thereafter. A total of 26 experiments were set up, of which 13 were served as controls with separate introduction of the mixture ingredients. Through serial vertebral angiography with a 50 per cent urotrast solution it was found that following introduction of the fibrinogen and thrombin mixture the lumen of the basilar artery and of its branches contracts on the average up to 89.2 +/- 1 per cent. After introduction of fibrinolysis the diameter of the artery initially increases up to 116.3 +/- 2.5 per cent. In 3 hours time a pronounced spasm of the basilar artery and of its branches is seen to develop up to 80.9 +/- 3.6 per cent and after 24 hours -- up to 73.9 +/- 2.1 per cent. The spasm persists for up to 10 days, but its intensity gradually declines. During subsequent 11--18 days the diameter of the brain base arteries returns back to normal. In control experiments no development of protracted spasm was demonstrated. Hence, it is established that the appearance of fibrinolysis products formed in the spinal fluid consequent upon dissolution of a clot of fibrin containing no blood cells is attended by the development of a protracted spasm involving major arteries of the brain.
