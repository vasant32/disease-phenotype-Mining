Intracerebral inoculation of viable Haemophilus somnus resulted in suppurative or fibrino-suppurative meningitis of the brain and spinal cord in rabbits. Multiple fibrin thrombosis complicated with meningitis in the central nervous system was produced by intracerebral inoculation of H. somnus followed by intravenous inoculation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The latter reaction may be attributable to a form of Shwartzman reaction.
