The clinical values of coils embolization in the treatment of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM) and related complications were investigated. Eleven patients with PAVMs verified by pulmonary arterial angiography were treated by transcatheter coils embolization. Chest X-ray (11 cases), computer tomography (7 cases) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (2 cases) were performed before embolization. Blood-gas analysis was done in 5 cases before and after embolization. The follow-up materials of 8 patients were collected to evaluate the effect of embolization with coils. The clinical manifestations included cerebral embolus, hemoptysis and decreased oxygenation in 9 patients and the remaining 2 had no symptoms. 9/11 cases were found by chest X-ray and 8 were diagnosed definitely. 7/7, 2/2 cases were diagnosed by CT or MR and diagnosis was made in all cases. Embolization was performed in 29 vessels. Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood of 5 cases changed significantly before and after embolization. Slight complications occurred in 6 patients, such as low fever, chest pain, pleurisy. The follow-up results showed that 7 cases were cured effectively. No primary and secondary device migration, and no medical paradoxical embolization occurred. It was concluded that coils embolization is a well-established method for treating PAVMs. It is a minimally invasive lung preserving treatment with high efficiency and less complication.
