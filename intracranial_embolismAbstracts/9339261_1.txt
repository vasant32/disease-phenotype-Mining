Rheumatoid nodules represent a rare cardiac valvular involvement in rheumatoid arthritis. Patients are usually asymptomatic. We report two cases of such involvement: one presented as a tumour implanted on the mitral valve, with systemic embolisation; the other presented as aortic regurgitation with acute heart failure. Surgical treatment was performed in both cases. Histological examination revealed typical rheumatoid nodules. The authors discuss valvular involvement in rheumatoid arthritis.
