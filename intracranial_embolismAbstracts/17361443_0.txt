We report about the case of a 20-year-old patient who fell from the tenth floor. The patient suffered multiple injuries and systemic gas embolism. He survived his injuries despite CPR, massive transfusion, development of ARDS and SIRS with minimal neurological deficit. The possible pathogenesis of the systemic gas embolism as well as the therapy are discussed. Besides stabilizing the circulation with i.v. fluids, blood transfusion and catecholamine therapy, the use of hyperbaric oxygenation was the decisive therapeutic measure.
