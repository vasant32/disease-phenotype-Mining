Far-field auditory brainstem responses were recorded in ten patients in whom the distribution of pathology was defined at autopsy or at operation. The response normally consists of seven components in the initial 10 msec following click signals. Interruption of audiotory pathway at the junction of VII nerve with brainstem results in loss of response components after Wave I. Interruption of auditory pathway at the midbrain results in loss of response components after Wave III. We conclude that Wave I reflects activity of VIII nerve, Waves II and III reflect activity of cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, and superior olive and Waves IV and V reflect activity of lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus. The generators of Waves VI and VII were not defined.
