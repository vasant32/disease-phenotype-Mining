A patient who sustained a gunshot wound to the neck and subsequent blunt trauma is presented. No angiogram was performed after the initial injury. Subsequently, the patient developed a cerebral embolus from a thrombus dislodged from a pseudoaneurysm of the cervical carotid artery, resulting in complete occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery. After antiplatelet therapy, the distal internal carotid artery recanalized, and the pseudoaneurysm occluded spontaneously. We stress the need for the use of arteriography in the initial evaluation of penetrating injuries to the neck and the utility of repeated arteriograms for further treatment planning as these traumatic lesions can change with time.
