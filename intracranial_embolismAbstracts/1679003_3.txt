Polysaccharide sulphate (PSS) is a new heparinoid drug. The therapeutic effect and laboratory findings in the treatment of 282 cases with ischemic cerebrovascular disease by PSS were analysed in this study. In treating patients with acute cerebral infarction, the effective rate (93.2%) and highly effective rate (62.9%) were both significantly higher in comparison with controls. Excellent results were also obtained in treating patients with cerebral infarction at late and sequela stage and patients with transient ischemic attack. Laboratory observations and animal experiments showed that PSS has anticoagulative and vasodilatory effects. It can also reduce blood viscosity and serum lipids. So PSS is an effective drug for the prevention and treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.
