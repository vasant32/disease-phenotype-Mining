To determine whether potential sources of embolism such as atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), patent foramen ovale (PFO), mitral valve prolapse and atherosclerotic aortic debris can influence the outcome of patients after first cerebral ischemic event (CIE), 214 patients (124 stroke, 21 RIND, 69 TIA) were examined by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) up to 3 weeks after CIE and followed up for 12 months. For risk estimation, the patients were subdivided into group I = without and group II = with potential sources of embolism. We additionally took into account cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerotic risk factors (group la + IIa without, Ib + IIb with). Recurrence occurred in 14 out of 214 patients (6.5%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of ASA, PFO and aortic debris as well as cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerotic risk factors was associated with a twofold to threefold higher incidence of recurrent events. While potential sources of embolism alone had no influence on the recurrence rate (group I:8/111 = 7.2% versus group II: 6/103 = 5.8%, n.s.), this was significantly different in relation to cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerotic risk factors (groups Ia + IIa: 0/66 = 0%, groups Ib + IIb: 14/148 = 9.8%, p < 0.01). Our results show that potential sources of embolism do not appear to influence the recurrence rate in cardiac healthy subjects. In patients with cardiovascular diseases, however, potential sources of embolism are associated with a higher risk of recurrence, and should therefore be imaged by TEE.
