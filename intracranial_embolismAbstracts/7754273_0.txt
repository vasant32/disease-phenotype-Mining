A 60-year-old woman was admitted because of impairment of consciousness, vomiting and urinary incontinence. The CT-scan of the brain (without contrast agent) showed slight hypodensities in the areas of the basal ganglia. The great cerebral vein produced a very high intensity signal. We diagnosed an aseptic venous thrombosis of the great cerebral vein. The neurologic deficits increased, and an apallic syndrome was diagnosed in spite of heparin treatment. Causes of aseptic cerebral venous thrombosis are discussed.
