Four young women and six older men with mitral leaflet prolapse presented with visual disturbances consistent with embolism in the ophthalmic or posterior cerebral circulation. Cardiac arrhythmias were common, but these are rarely associated with focal ischaemia. The evidence that mitral leaflet prolapse caused the embolism in these patients is suggestive but not conclusive. Further studies are needed. All patients with acute cerebral or ocular ischaemia should undergo through cardiovascular assessment, which should include routine echocardiography.
