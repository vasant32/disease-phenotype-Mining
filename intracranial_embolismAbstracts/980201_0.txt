The levels of oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin were determined in the cerebrospinal fluid in 46 cases of subarachnoideal haemorrhage and cerebromeningeal haemorrhage, 18 cases of haemorrhagic infarction. Autopsy confirmation was available in 18 cases of haemorrhages and 18 cases of infarction. Determination of oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid is not sufficient as a reliable basis for differentiating between cerebral haemorrhage and haemorrhagic infarction. High values of oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin seem to indicate bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid spaces. Assessment of oxyhaemoglobin level and cerebrospinal fluid sediment suggests in some cases the diagnosis.
