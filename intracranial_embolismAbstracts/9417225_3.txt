Systemic embolism is an unusual complication of endoscopic obturation of gastroesophageal varices with glue. This report describes a case of cerebral embolism after this procedure. Intracardiac glue within the left atrium was demonstrated by echocardiography. Cardiac fluoroscopy demonstrated an abnormal vessel connecting periesophageal veins with the right upper pulmonary vein. Cardiac surgery was performed. Intracardiac glue was removed and the entering orifice of the abnormal vessel in the right upper pulmonary vein was sutured. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of intracardiac glue after variceal obturation. Echocardiography is useful in the diagnosis of this rare complication.
