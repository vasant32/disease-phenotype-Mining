Recent major surgery is an exclusion criterion for thrombolysis. Six patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis after recent open heart surgery without clinically significant bleeding complications, although one patient developed a small, asymptomatic cerebellar hemorrhage. Intra-arterial thrombolysis may be an option for patients with cerebral embolism in the perioperative period.
