This case study described the success of a technique labeled Multiple Oral Rereading (MOR) in the remediation of a case of acquired alexia in an adult male. Unusually slow visual-verbal processing characteristic of this patient is sometimes noted in dyslexic children. The possibility that MOR might prove effective for other selected cases of acquired alexia and "developmental" dyslexia is considered.
