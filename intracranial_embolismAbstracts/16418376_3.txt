 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because carotid plaque ulceration is associated with an increased risk of cerebral embolism, residual carotid plaque ulceration directly around a stent (persistent ulceration) after carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) could still be a risk factor for a stroke. The purpose of this study is to understand the morphologic and clinical prognosis of persistent ulceration. PATIENTS AND TECHNIQUES: CAS was attempted on 91 consecutive stenotic lesions (80 patients). Of these, 54 lesions (48 patients) had ulceration before CAS. Angiograms were evaluated immediately after the procedure. Persistent ulceration was found in 34 lesions (30 patients). The mean depth and length of persistent ulcers were 2.1 mm (range, 1-4.7 mm) and 8.9 mm (range, 1.5-22 mm), respectively. All patients with persistent ulceration were followed with antiplatelet therapy. RESULTS: No ischemic event due to the lesions occurred during the mean follow-up period of 25.5 months (range, 3-48 months). Angiography on 25 lesions (21 patients) at a mean of 5.8 months (range, 1-21 months) after CAS showed that persistent ulceration disappeared in 12 lesions (48%), improved in 11 lesions (44%), and remained unchanged in 2 lesions (8%). Nine lesions (36%) showed restenosis, which were < or =30% and did not require any additional intervention. New ischemic lesions were not detected in any of the 14 patients (17 lesions) who underwent follow-up MR imaging at a mean of 9 months (range, 1-32 months) after CAS. CONCLUSION: We conclude that persistent ulceration after CAS improves spontaneously and is not a risk factor for cerebral embolism.
