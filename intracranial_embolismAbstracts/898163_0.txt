A disk oxygenator (Bj√∂rk-AGA HLM) with a moderate hemodilution prime and two bubble oygenators (Harvey H 800 and Galen Optiflo 42-201) with a clear fluid prime are compared in regard to their effect upon postoperative intellectual function as measured by psychometric tests. There was no difference between the two bubble oxygenators. There was a marked, statistically significant difference between the bubble oxygenators and the disk oxygenator, the disk oxygenator yields considerably worse results. The reason for this is obscure but probably lies in the different microembolic output. The literature, however is not consistent on this question. At the present time, only bubble oxygenators are used in our unit.
