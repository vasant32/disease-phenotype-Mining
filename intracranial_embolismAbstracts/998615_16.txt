CNS infarction is a devastating complication in sickle cell anemia. Episodes are frequently repetitive and often result in permanent neurologic abnormalities. In an attempt to prevent such recurrences a periodic transfusion program was begun at the Children's Hospital of Michigan in 1969. Twenty-one children currently on the program receive buffy-coat poor transfusions on an out-patient basis every 3 weeks. Of 15 who have been on the program for periods of from 9 months to 5 3/4 years, none have had progression of neurologic abnormalities, and several have had definite improvement in neurologic function. One child who was not brought in regularly had recurrent CNS infarction. The only recognized complication has been one instance of serum hepatitis. While such a transfusion program is not without risk, it seems an effective way of preventing progression of neurologic abnormalities resulting from recurrent CNS infarction in sickle cell anemia.
