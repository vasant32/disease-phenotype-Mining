OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using ablation energy appears an effective treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF) with a success rate of approximately 80%. However, post-procedural neurological complications still occur in 0.5-10% of all patients undergoing PVI, presumably due to embolism. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of cerebral micro-embolic signals (MES) as a surrogate marker for the risk of neurological impairment of two different PVI methods: (1) percutaneous endocardial radio-frequency (RF) ablation and (2) thoracoscopic epicardial ablation using RF energy. METHODS: Ten patients (eight persistent AF and two paroxysmal AF) underwent a minimally invasive thoracoscopic epicardial (EPI) RF ablation and 10 patients (one persistent AF and nine paroxysmal AF) underwent a percutaneous endocardial (ENDO) isolation. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used to detect an MES in the middle cerebral arteries. RESULTS: An average of 5 (+/-6) MES were detected during epicardial PVI procedure versus 3908 (+/-2816) MES during percutaneous endocardial PVI procedure. During the ablation application period, respectively, 1 (+/-1) and 2566 (+/-2296) cerebral MES were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral micro-emboli during epicardial ablation are almost absent when compared to the thousands of emboli measured during percutaneous endocardial ablation.
