A patient is reported who suffered from a fixed, non-progressive encephalopathy caused by a lesion involving the left portion of both the mesencephalon and basal ganglia; the lesion was caused by an acquired prenatal vascular insult. The clinical expression of third cranial nerve palsy corresponds to a nuclear syndrome of the left oculomotor nerve, affecting both eyes asymmetrically, later developing into aberrant reinnervation.
