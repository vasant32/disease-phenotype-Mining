OBJECTIVE: To investigate the experience of patients in acute cardiogenic shock required insertion of mechanical circulation support devices (MCS) before undergoing standard pretransplant evaluations. METHODS: From February 2005 to August 2007, 10 patients including 7 male and 3 female required emergency bridging placement of MCS. Average age was (40 +/- 16.2) years old. Mean body weight was (70.8 +/- 18.1) kg. There were 5 patients of dilated cardiomyopathy, 2 patients of arrhythmic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 2 patients of ischemic cardiomyopathy and 1 patient of end-stage valvular heart disease. All patients were accompanied with acute decompensation of congestive heart failure. Before implantation of MCS, all patients received treatment of three or more inotropic drugs at maximal dosages, 6 patients suffered from ventricular tachycardia, 4 patients required cardio-pulmonary resuscitation treatment and 3 patients suffered from definite function defect of liver and kidney. MCS included ECMO for 8 patients, BVS5000 and MEDOS for 1 patient respectively. RESULTS: The duration of MCS supporting was 3 to 44 d with a mean of (11.5 +/- 13.9) d. Four patients were successfully supported for getting heart transplantation, 1 patient received kidney transplantation simultaneously. Two patients recovered from acute heart failure, discharged and remained on regular heart transplantation list. One patient died from cerebral embolism after 44 days' support and 1 died from multiple organ failure after 3 days' support. Because of severe infection, MCS treatment of 2 patients was terminated ahead of schedule by their family and the patients were lost finally. CONCLUSIONS: The use of MCS devices for acute catastrophic situation appears warranted despite the abbreviated transplant evaluations. It is important for improving the outcomes with beginning MCS support before multiple organ system failure occurs, and accurately identifying individuals who can benefit from MCS.
