Epileptic seizures due to thrombotic cerebral infarction were studied in 118 patients. The occurrence of seizures had a bimodal distribution with one peak period within 2 weeks and another peak period from 6 to 12 months after stroke. Four patients had seizures preceding stroke, while 23 patients without a history of previous stroke had "silent infarct" on the CT scan. Fifteen patients (13%) had status epilepticus. Simple partial seizures occurred in 56% of patients, complex partial seizures in 24% and generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 4%. Epilepsy developed in 35% of patients with early seizures and in 90% of patients with late seizures.
