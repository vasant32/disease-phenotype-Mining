Most cases of hydatid disease in human populations are due to Echinococcus granulosus. The hydatid life cycle involves passage between definitive hosts such as dogs and intermediate hosts such as sheep. Humans become accidental intermediate hosts following ingestion of food or water contaminated with eggs or by contact with infected dogs. Although hydatid disease may remain asymptomatic, occasional cases of sudden and unexpected death present to autopsy. Causes of rapid clinical decline involve a wide range of mechanisms including anaphylaxis (with or without cyst rupture), cardiac outflow obstruction or conduction tract disturbance, pulmonary and cerebral embolism, pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary hypertension, peritonitis, hollow organ perforation, intracerebral mass effect, obstructive hydrocephalus, seizures, cerebral ischemia/infarction, and pregnancy complications. The autopsy assessment of cases therefore requires careful examination of all organ systems for characteristic cystic lesions, as multiorgan involvement is common, with integration of findings so that possible mechanisms of death can be determined. Measurement of serum tryptase and specific IgE levels should be undertaken for possible anaphylaxis.
