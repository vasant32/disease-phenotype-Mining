Difficulties in achieving focal temporary cerebral ischemia in experimental animals have delayed study of the prevention and treatment of cerebral infarction. We have succeeded in producing focal cerebral infarction by temporary occlusion of brain arteries. Infarction confined to the anterior portion of the thalamus was obtained by simultaneous occlusion of the 4 cerebral arteries: internal carotid, anterior cerebral, middle cerebral and posterior communicating arteries for 60-120 minutes. This experimental model in dogs is unique, since thalamic infarction can be produced with high frequency, and the dogs can be kept alive and managed for sufficient periods after temporary artery clipping. With this model it is possible to investigate cerebral infarction not only from the pathophysiological viewpoint, but also from the viewpoint of prevention and treatment of cerebral infarction in man.
