A forty-one-year-old man with a cavernous hemangioma of the right cavernous sinus underwent a preoperative cerebral angiogram and a balloon occlusion test of the internal carotid artery. During the operation to remove the cavernous sinus lesion, the ipsilateral electroencephalogram was found to be abnormal. An embolic occlusion of the M2 and M3 segments of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was discovered. A platelet and thromboembolus was removed via multiple incisions, and flow was restored. The cavernous sinus lesion was removed uneventfully. At the end of the operation, the MCA was found to be reclotted. Flow was eventually restored by replacing the M2 segment of the MCA with a 2-cm saphenous vein graft. The patient recovered without any deficits of brain function and with transient deficits of Cranial Nerves III and VI. Computed tomography revealed infarcts in the temporal and parietal areas. When MCA embolectomy is unsuccessful, vein graft replacement should be considered to restore flow and to avoid major neurological deficits.
