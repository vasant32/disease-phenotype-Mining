Calcific emboli from a calcific aortic stenosis is an uncommon event, usually following local trauma, as from cardiac surgery or left heart catheterization or as a sequel to bacterial endocarditis. We report what we believe to be the first case of a spontaneous calcareous emboli demonstrated by cranial computed tomography. In this patient, systemic hypertension and mild aortic insufficiency may have caused increasing mechanical forces acting on the aortic cusps and may have precipitated embolism.
