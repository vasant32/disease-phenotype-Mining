Oral antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis is not yet widely accepted. A study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of oral amoxycillin in this condition. Fifteen patients were treated with high-dose oral amoxycillin for 6 weeks. Twelve responded to treatment and remain well at 3 years. There were 3 deaths--1 at day 7 due to sudden aortic cusp rupture, and 2 late deaths due to pulmonary and cerebral embolism respectively. There was 1 relapse of streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis 8 weeks after oral treatment, but this responded to conventional intravenous therapy. Oral amoxycillin is effective in uncomplicated streptococcal endocarditis, and should not be used with prosthetic valve infections.
