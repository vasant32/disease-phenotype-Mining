Infarction of the hippocampus and the right ventroposterolateral thalamus was observed. Angiography revealed a posterior cerebral artery occluded near its origin, immediately upstream from the posterior communicating artery. The infarction was limited to the areas irrigated by the branches originating in the proximal part of the artery. More distal branches for the calcarine scissure and the temporooccipital gyruses were not involved.
