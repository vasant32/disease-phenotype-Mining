Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), are known to liberate nitric oxide (NO). In this study the effects of SNP and SIN-1 on thrombus formation in rat cerebral arterioles and venules in vivo were assessed using a helium-neon (He-Ne) laser. SNP infused at doses from 10 micrograms/kg/h significantly inhibited thrombus formation in a dose dependent manner. This inhibition of thrombus formation was suppressed by methylene blue. SIN-1 at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg/h also demonstrated a significant antithrombotic effect. Moreover, treatment with SNP increased vessel diameter in a dose dependent manner and enhanced the mean red cell velocity measured with a fiber-optic laser-Doppler anemometer microscope (FLDAM). Blood flow, calculated from the mean red cell velocity and vessel diameters was increased significantly during infusion. In contrast, mean wall shear rates in the arterioles and venules were not changed by SNP infusion. The results indicated that SNP and SIN-1 possessed potent antithrombotic activities, whilst SNP increased cerebral blood flow without changing wall shear rate. The findings suggest that the NO released by SNP and SIN-1 may be beneficial for the treatment and protection of cerebral infarction.
