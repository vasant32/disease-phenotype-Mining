The clinical onset of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is very variable and the causes that may lead to its development are also quite numerous. Although characteristic CT diagnostic signs have been described, in most cases only nonspecific findings are present and angiography is required to confirm the diagnosis. The prognosis is variable. Classically, the mortality is high when the deep venous system is involved. We report a male with CVT involving Galen's vein and its major tributary vessels, who had a favorable outcome with heparin therapy and drugs for cerebral edema. We discuss the etiologic factors in this patient, the characteristic neuroradiologic findings, and their evolution during the course of therapy.
