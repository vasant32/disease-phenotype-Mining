Cognitive decline has recently been found to be associated with microemboli in cerebral vessels in patients with artificial heart valves. The authors sought to determine the nature of such microemboli, that is, whether they are gaseous or solid, by comparing their characteristics to those of artificially generated air emboli in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO). Three hundred and forty-eight microemboli were recorded in 11 patients with artificial valves (all taking coumadin), and 86 microemboli were recorded in response to intravenous injection of saline agitated with air in 8 PFO patients. No difference in intensity, duration, or relative velocity of microemboli was found between groups. The authors conclude that microemboli generated from artificial heart valves are generally gaseous and not solid.
