AIM: To observe the effects of histidine (i.v. 5 mg.kg-1) on brain edema and cardiac disturbance after cerebral thrombosis. METHODS: Regional cerebral thrombosis was induced by photochemical method in rats. RESULTS: It was showed that the brain water content increased markedly (85.6 +/- 3.8%, P < 0.01); the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP, 17.9 +/- 1.5 kPa) and the maximal left ventricular contractility decreased (+dp/dtmax 645 +/- 110 kPa and -dp/dtmax 473 +/- 106 kPa, P < 0.05). In rats treated with histidine after photochemical reaction, the brain water content decreased (81.5 +/- 2.0%) while LVSP (21.2 +/- 1.1 kPa) and left ventricular +dp/dtmax and -dp/dtmax increased markedly (777 +/- 144 kPa and 604 +/- 157 kPa, respectively). CONCLUSION: Histidine has protective effects on the brain and cardiac function during cerebral thrombosis.
