The method described by the authors in their present paper was used to examine the cerebrospinal fluids obtained from a total of 120 patients, of whome 30 were afflicted with tumors of the central nervous system, 35 were suffering from inflammatory diseases, and 55 had cerebral blood-supply disorders in the sense of hemorrhagic and ischemic insults. Characteristic features of the formation of the crystallographic pattern could be observed in dependence upon the dynamics of the disease process. These are of extreme importance to accurate differential diagnosis. The method is recommended for use in neurological and neurosurgical departments.
