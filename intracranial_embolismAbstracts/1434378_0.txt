A cardiac myxoma is a very rare cause for a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). We report the case of a nine-year-old boy who had an epileptic seizure, the computer-tomographically suspected diagnosis was intracerebral granulomas of unknown etiology. Five months later he suffered an acute hemiparesis and a CRAO. Through echocardiography the diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma was determined. This case shows the importance of the differential diagnosis "cardiac myxoma" in cases of central retinal artery occlusion in young patients especially with additional neurological disorders.
