An i.v. bolus of (14C) deoxyglucose was injected into 4 groups of rats which simultaneously were embolized through the internal carotid artery. 15 and 30 min post embolization there was a massive decrease in (14C) deoxyglucose uptake in both deep and cortical structures. At 4 h a small zone of increased (14C) deoxyglucose uptake persisted around each embolized microsphere.
