The authors report the first case of lethal cerebral embolism complicating thrombolytic therapy administered for thrombosis of a mitral valve prosthesis. The incidence of systemic embolism during this form of therapy appears to be at least one in five cases. It may be underestimated and should lead to further discussion as to the indications of thrombolytic therapy and surgery for thrombosis of a left heart valve prosthesis.
