Two cases are described of a previously unrecognised sequel of posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. The first case documents freely mobile blood clots within the lateral ventricular system, the second variable asymmetry in the size of the dilated lateral ventricle. The unilateral ventricular dilatation depended on which side the infant was lying, the dependent ventricle being considerably larger than the upper one within 4 hours of head turning. Each of these conditions spontaneously resolved with no specific treatment.
