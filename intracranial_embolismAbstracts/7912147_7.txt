This study was undertaken in 64 patients, 50 with mechanical and 14 with porcine prosthetic valves, to evaluate the incidence of intracranial emboli and their distribution in the basal cerebral arteries. The patients were studied using transcranial Doppler (EME TC2-64B, Uberlingen, Germany), with a monitoring time of two minutes over each of the internal carotid arteries, middle and anterior cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries and the basilar artery. Sixty-three of the 64 patients were stabilized on warfarin at the time of the study. The incidence of emboli signals was significantly higher in patients with mechanical compared to porcine cardiac valves (88% versus 14%, p < 0.01). The number of emboli signals was significantly higher in the anterior compared with the posterior circulation, with a median of eight signals in the internal carotid arteries (95% confidence interval 5-15), 2.5 in the vertebral arteries (95% confidence interval 1-5.5)(p < 0.03). It was also significantly higher in those patients who had undergone double (aortic and mitral) as opposed to those who had undergone single aortic valve replacement: 18 versus two signals per minute (confidence intervals 5-30.5 versus 0.5-3.5) (p < 0.01). It is concluded that subclinical emboli signals are readily detectable using transcranial Doppler and are common in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Their number depends on both the type and the number of the prosthesis, while their distribution in the basal cerebral arteries is consistent with their cardiac source.
