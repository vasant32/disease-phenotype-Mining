We report a young musician who experienced transient ischemic attacks during trumpet playing. Cardiovascular examination revealed a patent foramen ovale; Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral arteries detected microembolic signals with increased rates during trumpet playing and Valsalva maneuver. After operative occlusion of the foramen ovale, the symptoms disappeared and no microembolic signals could be detected.
