Thrombocytosis is a rare cause of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with intrinsically normal coronary and cerebral vasculature. This report details the occurrence of inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) consequent upon postsplenectomy thrombocytosis in a thirty-four-year-old man with angiographically normal coronary arteries. The MI was complicated by early left ventricular mural thrombus formation and embolic cerebral infarction. Combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy was required to prevent the recurrence of ischemic events.
