We examined the influence of an experimental venous and arterial air embolism on the hearing level in laboratory mini pigs. Before and after the injection of air a threshold ABR was measured in anaesthetized mini pigs (n=15). A venous air embolism was performed in 6 animals: no changes in the hearing level or in the interpeak latencies Jewett wave V-I were observed in any of the animals before, during or after the application of air. In 9 animals the arterial embolism was done, 2 animals died and had to be excluded. In 6 animals out of 7 a hearing loss was observed starting after the injection of 40 ml air and finally ending in deafness for these 6 animals. The detected hearing loss is probably of cochlear origin, as no prolongations of the interpeak latencies of Jewett wave V-I at 90 dB HL were observed prior to the deafness. Our results show that air bubbles in the arterial circulation lead to cochlear damage ending in deafness. Our research indicates that decompression sickness, which is comparable to the arterial air embolism, is more often the cause of a sensorineural hearing loss after diving than previously believed.
