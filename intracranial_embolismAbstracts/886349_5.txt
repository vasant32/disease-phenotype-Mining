A 78 year old, right handed man developed the syndrome of alexia without agraphia due to a right occipital thrombotic stroke. The cerebral dominance test strongly suggests that his right hemisphere is dominant. This is believed to be the first case of alexia without agraphia secondary to a right occipital lesion in a right handed person.
