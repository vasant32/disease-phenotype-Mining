Serial 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from the brain in 19 rats following microsphere embolization of the right internal carotid artery. The brains were sectioned and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoline chloride 6 h post-embolization to visualize infarcted areas. There was a narrow dosage range for the effect of embolism measured by maximum decline in pH at 20 min, mortality, and infarct size. This narrow range effect may be due to occlusion of collateral channels by the 16 micron microspheres. There was a strong correlation between decline in pH at 20 min post-embolization and infarct size (r2 = 0.76); this decline was the best early marker for eventual infarct in our study. This animal model for macroscopically heterogenous brain ischemia may be useful for the evaluation of therapeutic interventions in stroke, and as an aid in the interpretation of phosphorus spectra from mixed volumes of ischemic and non-ischemic brain.
