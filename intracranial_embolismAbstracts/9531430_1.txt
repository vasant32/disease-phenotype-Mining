OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical outcome of patients with epileptic seizures due to ischemic stroke (IS) of cardiac or artery-to-artery embolism. METHODS: Seizures due to IS of cardiac or artery-to-artery embolism are differentiated by clinical, neuroimaging and cardiovascular test data. RESULTS: From 174 cases with supratentorial IS, 13 patients suffered from epileptic seizures due to cardiac embolism, 11 patients due to artery-to-artery embolism. The patients with cardiac IS showed an equal sex distribution and EEG abnormalities in 6 patients, the initial seizure occurred on average after 222 days (SD, +/-69 days). Among the 11 patients with artery-to-artery embolic IS, there were 9 males and 2 females and EEG abnormalities in 10 patients. The initial seizure occurred on average after 447 days (SD, +/-177 days). CONCLUSION: In seizures due to artery-to-artery embolism, there is a male preponderance and a higher incidence of EEG abnormalities, symptomatic seizures appear later compared to IS due to cardiac embolism.
