A 37-year-old man was admitted to our clinic 3 hours after the onset of cerebrovascular accident with right hemiparesis and total aphasia. On admission, we started combined administration of mannitol, vitamin E, phenytoin (Sendai Cocktail) and perfluorochemicals to protect ischemic brain. Left cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery involving its perforating arteries. Following the performance of angiography, vascular balloon catheter was introduced into the embolus, and fibrinolytic agent (urokinase) was continuously injected. Soon after the injection of 240,000 unit urokinase, recanalization of left middle cerebral artery was shown by repeated cerebral angiography performed 5.5 hours after the onset. On his clinical course, left hemiparesis and aphasia were improved step by step, and 1 week later, he could walk by himself with minor neurological deficits. Further examination revealed that myxoma was located on left atrium by echocardiography. Within 1 week, the patient was transferred to cardio-surgical unit, and myxoma was successfully removed. Now he is in good health and has returned to his job. Usually cerebral embolisms result from atrial myxoma cause severe cerebral infarction. Here we reported a case of cerebral embolism by myxoma and recanalized using fibrinolytic agent by balloon catheter injection. The damage will be reduced if the duration of occlusion is limited, so this method will be helpful to treat cerebral embolism.
