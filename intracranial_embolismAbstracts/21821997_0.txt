Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a common and safe bronchoscopic technique used in the management of obstructing lesions and hemorrhage in the central airways. Complications of bronchoscopic APC are uncommon and include hemorrhage, perforation and fire in the airways. While bronchoscopic APC has been reported to cause systemic gas embolization and associated cardiovascular collapse, we report a case of cerebral gas embolization that occurred during bronchoscopic APC and highlight underappreciated potential risk factors for its occurrence.
