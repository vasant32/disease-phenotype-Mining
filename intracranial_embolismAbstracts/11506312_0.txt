We report here an autopsy case of massive pontine hemorrhagic infarction secondary to embolic basilar artery occlusion. A large embolus appeared to have traversed the vertebral artery into the basilar artery as a result of basilarization of the vertebral artery due to severe stenosis of the contralateral vertebral artery. Extensive ischemia due to embolic occlusion of the entire length of the basilar artery, and migration of the embolus are assumed to have resulted in a massive pontine hemorrhagic infarction.
