We present an analysis of the neurologic manifestations of Staphylococcus aureus infections in 43 patients. Half of the infections whose source could be identified were nosocomial. The spectrum of neurological sequelae included meningitis, solitary and multiple intracerebral and epidural abscesses, cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage, acute encephalopathies, subdural empyemas, spinal abscesses, and radicular compression syndromes. In the majority of patients the course was severe and protracted and relapses were frequent. Mortality was high (28%), even with early diagnosis and treatment; diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and chronic renal failure were unfavorable prognostic factors. In patients with abscess formation early surgical drainage improved the outcome. However, often treatment was complicated by sequestration at inaccessible foci and secondary dissemination. Combined antibiotic therapy with flucloxacillin and chloramphenicol may be the most successful antibiotic regimen.
