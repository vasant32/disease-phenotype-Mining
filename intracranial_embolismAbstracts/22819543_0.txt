BACKGROUND: This study investigated the relationship between CHADS(2) scores and the rate of antithrombotic drug use and clinical outcomes in patients with an initial cardioembolic stroke who had nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). METHODS: In 234 patients (135 men and 99 women; mean age [±SD] 76 ± 11 years) with initial cardiogenic cerebral embolism with NVAF who were admitted to our hospital between April 2007 and March 2011, the CHADS(2) score, use of warfarin, and clinical outcomes were retrospectively investigated. RESULTS: CHADS(2) scores were as follows: 0 points, n = 21 (9%); 1 point, n = 72 (31%); 2 points, n = 92 (39%); 3 points, n = 47 (20%); and 4 points, n = 2 (1%). The overall warfarin use rate was low (14.1%; n = 33), and it was significantly (P = .023) lower for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (8%) than for chronic atrial fibrillation (18.5%). The clinical outcomes evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score after 3 months were: CHADS(2) score 0 points, mRS 0 to 2 (81%) and 3 to 6 (19%); 1 point, mRS 0 to 2 (46%) and 3 to 6 (54%); 2 points, mRS 0 to 2 (46%) and 3 to 6 (54%); and ≥3 points, mRS 0 to 2 (29%) and 3 to 6 (71%). The clinical outcome worsened as the CHADS(2) score increased (P = .002). Logistic regression analysis revealed that being ≥75 years of age and having a high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission were related to a poor outcome (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The overall warfarin use rate was low in initial cardioembolic stroke patients with NVAF. Clinical outcomes deteriorated with increases in the CHADS(2) score, age ≥75 years, and NIHSS score on admission were related to a poor clinical outcome.
