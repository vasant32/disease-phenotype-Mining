The use of extracorporeal assist devices in heart failure is associated with the risk of thromboembolic complications [1]. Prove of thromboembolic material in the ventricles and tubes of the assist devices is difficult, and the clinical relevance of thrombotic material in the tubes is not clear. Here, we report on a patient with severe heart failure caused by endstage dilated cardiomyopathy who was bridged to transplantation using a biventricular assist device (BVAD). Five weeks after implantation, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) revealed high intensity transient signals (HITS) in basal cerebral arteries, suggesting continued cerebral microembolism. Apart from a correlation of these Doppler sonographic findings with neurological symptoms, macroscopic evidence of fibrin thrombi in the artificial ventricle, and post mortem confirmation of cerebral infarction could be proved.
