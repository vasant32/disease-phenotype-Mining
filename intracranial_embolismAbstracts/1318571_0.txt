A case study of acute ischemic monomelic neuropathy due to occlusion of the right subclavian artery is reported. The occlusion was embolic. Clinical examination showed sensory loss and severe distal weakness of the limb without obvious muscle necrosis. EMG showed motor and sensory nerve axon loss, chiefly distally. Despite surgical intervention, the neurological damage was irreversible.
