INTRODUCTION: Cerebral air embolism is a neurological emergency. It has been reported following cardiac catheterization, central venous catheter insertion, and cardiothoracic surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a case of massive cerebral air embolism secondary to intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) rupture. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed serpiginous hypodensities following the sulci associated with hypodense brain parenchymal lesions. CONCLUSION: The prompt recognition of cerebral air embolism secondary to IABP rupture requires a high level of suspicion and is confirmed by head CT.
