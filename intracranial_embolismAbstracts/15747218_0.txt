A rescue clot disruption using a basket snare is described for acute basilar artery embolic occlusion resistant to balloon angioplasty and fibrinolysis therapy. In spite of failed balloon angioplasty in conjunction with fibrinolysis, a basket-shaped snare connected to a microguide wire could be used to catch and crush the clot in the upper basilar artery. The rescue use of a snare may be effective for angioplasty-resistant acute embolic stroke.
