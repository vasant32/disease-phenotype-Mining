In this report, the maternal and fetal risks in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) were evaluated. A patient with PNH carried a pregnancy to successful delivery, with a healthy male infant, and suffered from postpartum cerebral subcortical thrombosis followed by recovery. An elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme (alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) was observed during pregnancy; the level returned to normal by delivery. However, the hemoglobin concentration during pregnancy and post-partum was kept at 8 g/dl. This is the first report of a relation between the onset of hemolysis and pregnancy. The management of pregnancy in such patients is discussed.
