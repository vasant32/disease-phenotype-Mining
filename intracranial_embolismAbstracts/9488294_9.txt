OBJECT: The present study was conducted to estimate the frequency and timing of rebleeding after initial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured giant aneurysms. METHODS: The authors reviewed records of 109 patients who suffered an initial SAH from a giant aneurysm and were treated at the Mayo Clinic between 1973 and 1996. They represented 25% of patients with giant intracranial aneurysms seen at this institution during that 23-year period. Seven of the patients were residents of Rochester, Minnesota, and the rest were referred from other institutions. The aneurysms ranged from 25 to 60 mm in diameter, and 74% were located on arteries of the anterior intracranial circulation. The cumulative frequency of rebleeding at 14 days after admission was 18.4%. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage, cerebral angiography, and delayed aneurysm recurrence were implicated in rebleeding in some of the patients. Rebleeding was not precluded by intraaneurysm thrombosis. Among those who suffered recurrent SAH at the Mayo Clinic, 33% died in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Rebleeding from giant aneurysms occurs at a rate comparable to that associated with smaller aneurysms, a finding that should be considered in management strategies.
