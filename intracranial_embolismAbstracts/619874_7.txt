Six patients with left side unilateral neglect from lesions of the right cerebral hemisphere were tested with verbal and visuospatial crossing-out tasks. The symptoms of neglect were less severe with the visuospatial than with verbal tasks. We hypothesize that changes in the symptoms of neglect were produced because the tasks altered hemispheric arousal.
