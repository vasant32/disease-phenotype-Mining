Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a widely used treatment for vertebral compression fracture. It is relatively safe, but it can be complicated by pulmonary or cerebral embolism caused by the cement injected during the procedure. Here, we present a case of a 69-year-old male with extensive deep vein thrombosis from the inferior vena cava to the right iliac and left femoral veins, which occurred 10 months after vertebroplasty. He was treated successfully by catheter-directed thrombolysis, angioplasty, and stenting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful treatment of delayed thrombosis caused by migrated cement inside the inferior vena cava.
