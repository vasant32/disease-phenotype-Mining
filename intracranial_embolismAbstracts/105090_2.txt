The degree of brain abscess encapsulation is positively related to surgical mortality and methods to enhance capsule wall formation, therefore, have therapeutic relevance. Two primate models are described which may be useful in the investigation of encapsulation of traumatic and metastatic brain abscesses. Direct intracerebral inoculation induces abscesses displaying more prominent inflammatory responses and encapsulation than does septic embolisation, despite similar abscess age and size. Cerebral ischaemia surrounding metastatic suppurative foci may retard capsule wall formation.
