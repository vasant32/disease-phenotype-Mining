To evaluate the effect of body iron stores on the vulnerability of the brain to ischemia, a focal permanent brain ischemia was induced by photothrombotic occlusion of cortical vessels in rats with or without chronic treatment with iron dextran (25 mg iron/kg, every other day for 20 days, intraperitoneally). Iron dextran induced systemic iron overload as evidenced by high ferritin (Ft) ( x 5) and total iron levels ( x 3) in serum as well as increased Ft expression in the liver and heart. Conversely, neither serum free iron levels nor Ft expression in the brain were changed by iron dextran. Finally, infarct volume was not modified by iron dextran. In addition, induction of ischemia in rats treated with FeCl(3) (560 microg iron/kg, intravenously) as a means of increasing serum free iron levels during the ischemic period did not enlarge infarct volume. We then explored the effect of brain ischemia itself on serum Ft by measuring serum Ft before and after induction of brain ischemic insults with different neurologic outcomes in rats (brain embolization with microspheres, photothrombotic occlusion of cortical vessels, four-vessel occlusion). Serum Ft levels were found higher at day 1 after ischemia than before ischemia only in rats subjected to the most severe insult (brain embolization). In conclusion, our study showed that increased body iron stores do not increase the vulnerability of the brain to ischemia and that brain ischemia, if severe, results in the elevation of serum Ft levels.
