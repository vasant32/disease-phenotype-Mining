In the clinical part of the study routine neck PA radiographs taken with the mouth open were compared with soft tissue films with the mouth closed for detection of calcification in the carotid arteries. Only 5.5% of 90 hospitalized patients showed foci of calcification in routine films. But foci of calcification were seen in 22% of the soft tissue radiographs of the whole series. In the autopsy part of the study large foci of calcification were found at the carotid bifurcations in 12 out of 20 cadavers by radiography. In an additional five cases contact radiographs also showed smaller foci of calcification. The vascular endothelium over the calcification was often ulcerated. The significance of the large arterial foci of calcification demonstrated in the neck radiographs as a sign of atherosclerosis and as a source of cerebral thromboembolism is discussed.
