The availability of different semantic relations between mild anomic dysphasic and nondysphasic subjects was investigated using a picture description task. Results of the analyses revealed statistically nonsignificant differences between the two groups for the variables of total utterances and mean length of utterances. Of the different cases examined, a significant difference between the two groups of subjects was revealed in their use of the "other" case relation category. Also, within the dysphasic group maximum verbal paraphasias occurred for the object case. Discussion of the obtained results relate the selective availability of specific cases to the possible differences in linguistic coding between the two groups. Also, the interrelationship between quantity of verbal output and incidence of verbal paraphasia is discussed.
