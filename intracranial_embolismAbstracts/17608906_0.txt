OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability of the signal relative-intensity and sample-volume-length (SVL) to discriminate air bubbles from solid spheres in an in-vitro model using two different carrier frequencies of the Doppler transducer. METHODS: A gel ultrasound phantom was connected to a circuit in which blood-mimicking fluid circulated. Air bubbles (100-140 microm) and latex spheres (125 +/- 10 microm) were injected into the circuit and interrogated using 1- and 2-MHz transducers. High-intensity-transient-signals (HITS) were recorded with a dual-gated transcranial Doppler (TCD) system. Receiver-Operating-Characteristic curves determined the best cut-off points that would distinguish between embolic materials. RESULTS: HITS from air bubbles had higher intensities and longer SVL than solid spheres with either transducer (P < .0001). Air bubbles (P < .0001) and microspheres (P= .049) showed higher intensities with the 1-MHz relative to the 2-MHz transducer. The intensity increase with the 1-MHz transducer was greater for air bubbles than microspheres (P < .0001). The discriminating efficacy of both the relative-intensity and SVL was similar between transducers (intensity, P= .201; SVL, P= .98). CONCLUSIONS: The relative-intensity and SVL are equally effective to distinguish solid from air emboli using 1- and 2-MHz transducers. Our study indicates that using a lower carrier frequency does not improve the discrimination of air from solid emboli.
