BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical cerebral-fat embolism shows both reversible and irreversible changes. We used MR imaging to investigate the reversibility of embolized lesions induced with a fat-emulsion technique and to evaluate the histologic findings. METHODS: A fat emulsion was made with 0.05 mL of triolein and 20 mL of normal saline and vigorous to-and-fro movement through a three-way stopcock. In 50 cats, the internal carotid artery was infused with the fat emulsion. Cats were divided into six groups on the basis of time delay after embolization: 1 hour; 1 and 4 days; and 1, 2, and 3 weeks. MR imaging and histologic examination were performed at these times. RESULTS: Embolized lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images, isointense or mildly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images, isointense on apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and enhancing on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images at 1 hour. These MR imaging findings were less evident at day 1 and reverted to normal after day 4 (isointense on all images). Electron microscopy showed minimal findings in the cortical lesion in groups 1 and 2 (group 1 at 1 hour and group 2 at 1 hour and 1 day). Light microscopic findings revealed evidence of necrosis-small focal gliosis and demyelination in the periventricular white matter-in only one cat. The number of intravascular fat globules was not significantly different between groups, as visualized by oil red O staining. CONCLUSION: Cerebral-fat embolism induced by a triolein emulsion revealed reversible MR findings and minimal histologic findings.
