Among ten patients with acute ischemic cerebral accident and mitral leaflet prolapse, two women presented with visual disturbances consistent with embolism in the ophthalmic or posterior cerebral circulation. These observations emphasize the importance of thorough cardiovascular assessment in all patients with acute cerebral or ocular ischemia, and we suggest that echocardiography should be part of routine investigation of such patients.
