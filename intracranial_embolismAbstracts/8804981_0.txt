The yield of TTE and TEE in identifying cardiac sources of embolism in patients with TIA or stroke was calculated from data from the Berlin Stroke Data Bank. High risk sources of embolism were detected by TTE in 4.2% with and in 1.6% of patients without evidence of cardiac disease from case history, clinical symptomatology, and ECG respectively. TEE yielded high risk sources of embolism in 10.6% of patients with and in 4.2% of patients without evidence of cardiac disease from case history, clinical symptomatology, ECG, and TTE respectively. Pathological findings were 12 atrial thrombi, 4 ventricular thrombi, and 1 atrial myxoma. 12 out of 14 atrial thrombi were only detected by TEE and not by TTE. There was a significant association of high risk cardiac sources of embolism with pial artery infarct pattern in CCT compared with lacunes. The yield of TEE in detecting high risk sources was not significantly associated with CCT infarct pattern probably due to the small numbers of investigations.
