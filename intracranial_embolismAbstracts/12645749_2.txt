Cerebral protection and prevention of atheroembolism remain challenges in aortic arch reconstruction. To reduce neurologic complications, we developed a "no-touch" technique in which a trifurcated graft is anastomosed to the arch vessels during hypothermic circulatory arrest, reducing the risk of embolization while minimizing cerebral ischemia by permitting antegrade cerebral perfusion as arch reconstruction is completed.
