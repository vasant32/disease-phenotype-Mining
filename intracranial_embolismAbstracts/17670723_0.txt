The axillary artery is the preferred site for arterial cannulation in operations for ascending aorta and aortic arch replacement in order to reduce perfusion-related morbidity in acute dissection and to prevent cerebral embolism in atherosclerotic aneurysm. We present the case of a patient with a chronic dissection presenting as pseudocoarctation of the aortic arch in which bilateral axillary artery inflow was necessary to perfuse both ascending and descending aorta.
