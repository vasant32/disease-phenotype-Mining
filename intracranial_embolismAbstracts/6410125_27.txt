Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by intra-arterial injection of xenon 133 in 29 patients during cardiac operations. Marked changes occurred in all patients. A normal and significant correlation with temperature and plasma PCO2 (p less than 0.01) support the reliability of the method. Mean CBF measured between sternotomy and the onset of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was 38 ml/100 gm . min. The first minute of ECC was associated with a decrease in CBF in nine of 12 patients (p less than 0.02). During steady-state hypothermic ECC (temperature 29 degrees C), CBF increased unexpectedly to 64 ml/100 gm . min (p less than 0.01). Following rewarming steady-state normothermic ECC, mean CBF decreased to 42 ml/100 gm . min with signs of impairment of cerebral autoregulation. Ten and 20 minutes after termination of ECC, mean CBF was 40 and 41 ml/100 gm . min, respectively. Arterial PCO2 was found to be important in regulating CBF. The cerebral autoregulation maintained CBF down to arterial pressures of around 55 mm Hg. Below this level, CBF was significantly correlated with perfusion pressure (p less than 0.01). Multiple small emboli with a hyperemic border zone could cause a brain hyperperfusion, as seen in our patients during bypass. Measurements of CBF during ECC hold promise as a guide toward safer cardiac operations.
