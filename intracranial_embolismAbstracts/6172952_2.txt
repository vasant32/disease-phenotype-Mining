Unilateral cerebral microembolism was performed in the rat by injecting calibrated, 50 micrometers in diameter, carbonized microspheres into the internal carotid artery. The events that follow brain ischemia due to cerebral embolization were studied by the analysis of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, the degree of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the development of brain edema. Two hours after embolization there was no change in the brain water content. The local CBF (14C-ethanol technique) was only reduced in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Twenty-four hours after embolization the brain water content was increased significantly in the ipsilateral, but not in the contralateral hemisphere. Local CBF further decreased in the ipsilateral hemisphere and a reduction in flow was also observed in the contralateral hemisphere. Embolization led to an increase in the BBB permeability, analysed as regional penetrability of 3H-dextran and of Evans blue-albumin complexes, which was restricted to the side of the injection of the microspheres.
