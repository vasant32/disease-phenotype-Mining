The case is reported of a patient with primary thrombosis of the internal cerebral veins who presented initially with unilateral and later developed bilateral thalamic lesions revealed by computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography confirmed the diagnosis. Upon anticoagulation the patient recovered nearly completely.
