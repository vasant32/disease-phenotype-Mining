Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has become a common neurosurgical procedure. This technique, however, has been rarely used for stenosis of the internal carotid artery because of the resultant embolization with debris following balloon manipulation. We present a case of internal carotid artery stenosis with a complaint of transient mono-ocular blindedness, whose ischaemic attack was relieved by PTA operation. In this case, we applied endovascular treatment for carotid stenosis, known as 'seesaw balloon technique', which prevented cerebral embolization with debris from the lesion. This technique may simplify the endovascular treatment for distally located carotid stenosis and shorten the operation time.
