The authors report 189 case histories of pregnant women who had a neurological disorder, which either existed before the pregnancy or were discovered during the pregnancy. The most frequent aetiological conditions were, epilepsy, psychoses, vascular accidents, tumours and disseminated sclerosis. Pregnancy and neuropathology are an association for which the prognosis as a whole is good and linked to the time in the pregnancy when the neurological condition, whether it is stable or not, is discovered. The combination is absolutely compatible with the normal progress of pregnancy so long as the appropriate treatment is continued during the pregnancy. Cerebral vascular accidents that occur in pregnancy make the prognosis very much worse. In these circumstances neurosurgery may give some hope. This applies also for cerebral tumours, among which pituitary adenoma is becoming more and more frequent. Psychopathies can be a very baffling chapter when they are combined with pregnancy. Finally disseminated sclerosis, once it has been stabilised, is perfectly compatible with the normal outcome for a pregnancy.
