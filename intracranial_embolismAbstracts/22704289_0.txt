OBJECTIVE: The incidence of stroke in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting increases sharply in the face of significant atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta. We use a technique that allows full revascularization for this cohort of patients, while minimizing cerebral embolic risk. METHODS: Intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound was used to screen for moderate or severe atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta and to precisely identify safe areas for cannulation and proximal anastomoses. By using a mildly hypothermic fibrillating technique, distal revascularization was then performed without clamping the aorta. Proximal anastomoses were accomplished under brief periods of circulatory arrest. RESULTS: We routinely use this technique and examined our results in 71 consecutive patients found to have grade 3 or greater atherosclerotic plaque of the ascending aorta. This represented approximately 10.0% of our total population who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting over a 32-month period from January 2007 to September 2009. One patient (1.4%) had a mild stroke that resolved, and there were no other neurologic complications. CONCLUSIONS: We have found that clampless fibrillating heart surgery with circulatory arrest for proximal anastomoses is a safe and effective technique for revascularizing patients with significant ascending aortic disease who are at high risk for cerebral embolic complications.
