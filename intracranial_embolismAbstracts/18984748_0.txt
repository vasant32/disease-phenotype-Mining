A 76-year-old woman presented with multiple brain infarctions in the right middle cerebral artery and vertebral artery area. Carotid sonography revealed a large mobile pedunculated mass in the brachiocephalic artery, which showed rapid growth despite treatment with heparin and aspirin. Graft replacement of the brachiocephalic artery was performed under selective cerebral perfusion with deep hypothermia. Histology of the resected specimen revealed aortic atherosclerotic plaque.
