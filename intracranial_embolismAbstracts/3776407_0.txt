Localized intravascular coagulation (prethrombi, fibrin thrombi, aggregation and agglutination of red blood cells) in the microcirculatory bed of the brain in hemorrhagic stroke is secondary to cerebral hemorrhage. Microcirculatory impairments, as well as consumption of coagulation factors and fibrinolysis activation aggravate cerebral circulation disorders and contribute to an expansion of the involved area. Identification of the causes of the development, place and role of intravascular coagulation in the patho- and thanatogenesis of hemorrhagic strokes will make it possible to determine the ways of adequate medicated correction of these hemostatic disorders.
