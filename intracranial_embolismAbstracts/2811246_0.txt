The analysis has been performed of 40 cases of acute myocardial infarction with concomitant stroke versus 26 cases of acute myocardial infarction alone. Being a complication of acute myocardial infarction in 0.94% of the cases, the stroke was ischemic in 95% and hemorrhagic in 5% of the patients. Association of the two events accounted for lethal outcomes in 80% of the cases. The principal factors of the stroke risk in myocardial infarction are suggested. They involve: an advanced age, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, diabetes mellitus, recurrent or transmural myocardial infarction, previous acute episodes of disturbed cerebral circulation, essential hypertension and hyperglycemia.
