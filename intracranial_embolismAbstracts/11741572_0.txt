Previous studies have reported the low yield of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in unselected patients with a suspected cardiac source of embolism and the questionable effect on management decisions in these patients. In these studies, patients with a prosthetic valve (PV) were excluded, but such patients pose a significant diagnostic challange in routine clinical practice. Transthoracic echocardiography has a limited role in patients with a PV, particularly in the mitral position, and TEE has repeatedly been shown to be superior to transthoracic echocardiography for assessing prosthetic valvular function.  There are few data on TEE findings in PV patients with a suspected cardiac source of embolism. In these patients, TEE may have a higher yield than in a patient with a suspected cardiac source of emboli without PV. The present study was undertaken (1) to evaluate the yield of TEE for detecting thrombi in patients with PVs and suspected thromboembolism, and (2) to assess the utility of TEE findings in their management.
