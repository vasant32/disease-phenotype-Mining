We present a case of a severe systemic (paradoxical) air embolism occurring during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery in an otherwise healthy 35-year-old parturient. Uncomplicated spinal anesthesia and satisfactory surgical anesthesia were obtained; no sedatives were used and the patient was awake and alert and tolerating the procedure well. Immediately following infant and placental delivery (approximately 25 min after the spinal anesthetic was induced) the patient had acute onset of markedly decreased mental status, profound ventricular ectopy and labile blood pressure. The event lasted for approximately 10 min with spontaneous resolution. Neurologic status returned to normal by the end of the surgery, but electrocardiogram findings in the immediate postoperative period were consistent with myocardial ischemia and serial cardiac troponin levels confirmed myocardial injury. On postoperative day 1, an echocardiogram demonstrated the presence of a patent foramen ovale. The events in this case are likely to be due to paradoxical coronary and cerebral air embolism.
