Five autoptically proven cases with mycotic prosthetic valve endocarditis are reported with special reference to morphologic findings. The clinical signs in such patients manifest in the early post-operative phase and are accompanied with a high mortality rate. At autopsy, there were in all cases thrombotic vegetations upon the prosthetic valves which often caused severe arterial and cerebral embolic events. Histologically, fungi are demonstrable within the thrombotic material without any difficulties, and after embolectomy intra vitam, too. In addition to pathological aspects, the author briefly summarizes the most important symptoms of this affection, its arduous diagnostic management, its possible mode of infection, and its treatment.
