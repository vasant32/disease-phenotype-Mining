From a prospective registry of 103 stroke patients on early anticoagulation for cardiac embolus we selected 23 patients with a small deep infarct. We studied the incidence of hemorrhagic infarction on CT, and the risk of early anticoagulation. We found no hemorrhagic infarction on CT in any case, and no bleeding complications during the three week observation period. Obviously, early anticoagulation can be started safely in patients with a small deep infarct possibly caused by cardiac embolism.
