148 patients with various forms of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) were studied by means of a multiparametric analysis of in vitro platelet aggregation, based on the following six parameters: ADP and epinephrine primary and secondary aggregation thresholds and percent maximum aggregation induced by optimal concentrations of ADP and epinephrine. These patients were assigned to four study groups, according to clinical diagnosis supported by CT scan, of transient ischemic attack and reversible neurological deficit (TIA-RIND), or completed stroke, in the presence or absence respectively of antiplatelet medical treatment at the time of the study. A statistically significant increase of the in vitro platelet aggregation was found in 44.4% of the untreated TIA-RIND patients and in 33.9% of the untreated stroke patients. However this last group showed a higher percentage of very marked hyperaggregation. Differences between the two treated study groups and controls were not significant. No difference was found in collagen- and ristocetin-induced aggregation between the patient groups and the controls.
