The significant alterations in arachidonic acid metabolism of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes in 8 patients with cerebral thrombosis. The production of TXB2, LTB4 and 20-OH-LTB4 was significantly enhanced, whereas the PGE2 value also had an increasing tendency. It was suggested that the alterations of arachidonic acid metabolism of PMN leukocytes might augment the process of thrombosis and bring on more brain ischemia.
