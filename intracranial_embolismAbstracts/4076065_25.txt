Thromboembolic vascular disease is a frequent precipitant of seizures, and is the most common etiology in older patients. The occurrence of seizures shortly after a stroke, however, does not necessarily indicate that the patient will continue to have seizures following initial recovery. This is true even when patients present in epileptic status. This may be because early and late seizures are produced by different pathophysiologic mechanisms.
