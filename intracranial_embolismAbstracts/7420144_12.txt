Embolism from an aneurysm is one of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic symptoms associated with intracranial aneurysms. Four cases are reported in which aneurysms of the internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral arteries were the source of emboli resulting in cerebral infarction. In the treatment of these aneurysms, it is best to clip the neck of the aneurysm with great care to avoid embolism due to extrusion of clot into the distal artery.
