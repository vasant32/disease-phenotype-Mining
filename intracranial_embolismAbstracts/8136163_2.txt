To study the long-term results of the St. Jude medical prosthesis in the mitral position, 520 patients were evaluated who had undergone mitral valve replacement with St. Jude medical (SJM) prosthesis. Eighteen patients or 3.5% died in the early postoperative period (within 30 days after operation). The total follow-up was 2872 patient-years and late deaths occurred in 23 cases. Postoperative cerebral embolism occurred in six, bleeding complication in five, and thrombosed valve in two patients. Postoperative anti-coagulant therapy was initiated with both dipyridamole (300 mg/day) and warfarin potassium. After discharge from our hospital the patients underwent routine examination of their thrombo-tests or prothrombin times at least every 2-3 months, and the major thromboembolic or bleeding complication rate was 0.45%/100 patient-years. In a period of 12 years, severe hemolysis following implantation was seen in seven patients. The cause of this hemolysis was perivalvular leakage in two patients but there were no leakages in the other five patients, although preoperative moderate to severe liver dysfunction was noted. Ninety-three percent of the patients were followed up, and their postoperative New York Heart Association functional classes were I or II in 88.6% of the cases. Their clinical results after mitral valve replacement with SJM prosthesis in the anti-anatomical position showed excellent durability and a low incidence of valve-related complications.
