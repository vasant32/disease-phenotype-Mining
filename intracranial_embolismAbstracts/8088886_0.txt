The present study was undertaken to evaluate comparatively the lipid profile and platelet functions within 24 h of the three most frequent types of stroke encountered in clinical practice. Twenty patients of transient ischaemic attacks, 22 of thrombotic stroke and 26 of haemorrhagic stroke (hypertensive putaminal haemorrhage), all within 24 h of the acute event, and 21 control subjects were studied. Spontaneous platelet aggregation, platelet aggregation induced with adenosine diphosphate (2.5, 3.75 and 5.0 microM) and lipid profile (serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein) estimations were performed in all the subjects. Mean platelet aggregation values were significantly lower in haemorrhagic stroke patients as compared to controls. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein levels in ischaemic groups i.e., transient ischaemic attacks and thrombotic stroke patients, were significantly elevated, more so in the former group. It appears that platelet hypofunction has a role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive putaminal haemorrhage while in patients of transient ischaemic attack and thrombotic stroke, lipids may be a contributing factor in cerebral atherogenesis.
