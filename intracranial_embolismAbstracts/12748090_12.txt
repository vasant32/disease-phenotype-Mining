BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An embolus causing cerebral ischemia is a major cause of death and disability, and the search for methods to reestablish blood flow is of major importance. A technique for the emergent primary treatment of cerebral emboli causing stroke is presented in detail. METHODS: The method developed implies the mechanical extraction of the embolus with a standard vascular retrieval snare via the endovascular route without the use of thrombolytic agents. RESULTS: Five consecutive patients were treated to extract an embolus. All patients had substantial improvement in their clinical status. No revascularization hemorrhages occurred. CONCLUSION: In this small series, the embolectomy method described was reproducible, rapid, and safe. It may offer an alternative to other methods of vascular recanalization.
