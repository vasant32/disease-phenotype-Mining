A 74-year-old man with a history of asymptomatic right internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion experienced amaurosis fugax in the left eye. Angiography showed left cervical ICA stenosis in addition to right cervical ICA occlusion. The right anterior and middle cerebral artery (MCA) territories were perfused from the left ICA via the anterior communicating artery. Brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced cerebral blood flow and reduced cerebrovascular reactivity to acetazolamide only in the right cerebral hemisphere. The patient underwent left carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Transcranial Doppler monitoring showed microembolic signals in the left MCA during dissection of the left ICA, but intraoperative monitoring suggested absence of global hypoperfusion or ischemia in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres during left ICA clamping. Transient and slight motor weakness of the left upper extremity was noted on recovery from anesthesia. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the development of new spotty ischemic lesions only in the right cerebral hemisphere. The present case suggests that intraoperative cerebral embolism causing postoperative neurological deficits can develop exclusively in the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to CEA if the hemisphere has preoperative hemodynamic impairment and collateral circulation via the anterior communicating artery from the ICA ipsilateral to CEA.
