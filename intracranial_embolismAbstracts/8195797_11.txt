We describe a validation study of a new technique for detecting circulating pathological cerebral emboli. Theoretically one would expect solid emboli to be detectable as high intensity signals on the Doppler waveform, and such signals have been reported in humans with potential embolic sources. Pathological cerebral emboli (thrombi, platelet aggregates and atheroma) were introduced into the proximal carotid artery of an in vivo sheep model, and their passage detected in the cerebral circulation using Doppler ultrasound. All of 74 emboli, with a maximum dimension as small as 0.24 mm, were detected as short duration high intensity signals. Smaller pathological emboli could not be made but glass microspheres as small as 5-20 micron resulted in high intensity signals. A significant positive correlation was found between embolus size and relative intensity increase of the embolic signal. A significant positive correlation was also found between embolus size and duration of embolic signal. This study demonstrates that detection of circulating cerebral emboli is possible in vivo. This technique may allow selection of patients at particularly high risk of cerebral embolisation so that they can be given specific prophylactic treatment. Analysis of the Doppler signal may give information on the size of the embolus, although using current signal analysis it is impossible to distinguish between the signals produced by say a larger platelet embolus or a smaller thrombus embolus.
