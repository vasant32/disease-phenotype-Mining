The method of haemofiltration was used in 29 postoperative cardio-surgical patients with low blood pressure, high left ventricular filling pressure and low total peripheral resistance, which did not respond to the use of the intraaortic balloon pump or pharmaco-therapy. In severe low-output syndrome hemodynamic parameters are: reduced mean arterial pressure, increased left ventricular filling pressure, increased mean arterial pulmonary pressure as well as significantly reduced total peripheral resistance [4-6, 28]. Inspite of pharmaco-therapy, cardiac performance regarding peripheral perfusion is insufficient; this leads to a vicious cycle of irreversible O2-debt and severe cellular damage. After haemofiltration there was a significant improvement in the haemodynamic parameters, which in our opinion was due to the elimination of toxic peptides such as Myocardial Depressant Factor (MDF). In 27 of a total of 29 patients, haemodynamic parameters returned to normal after treatment. 19 patients were discharged, eight patients died after a number of days or weeks from causes not related to the original cardiogenic shock (cerebral embolism, reinfarction, myocardiopathy and pneumonia).
