Floating thrombus in a non-aneurysmal and non-atherosclerotic brachio-cephalic trunk is an extremely rare event with potentially catastrophic complications. There is a risk of both peripheral and cerebral embolization. We present a very rare case of floating thrombus in the brachio-cephalic trunk that presented with advanced ischaemia of the right upper limb. Confirmation of the diagnosis was done by CT angiogram. The upper limb symptoms were relieved by thrombectomy, supported by anticoagulation. For floating thrombus in the brachiocephalic trunk, the patient was started on aggressive anticoagulation therapy and there was significant resolution after two weeks and complete resolution after one month.
