Cardiac papillary fibroelastoma (CPF) is a rare cardiac neoplasm predominantly affecting the cardiac valves. Although it is most commonly an incidental finding, it can result in life-threatening complications, such as coronary and cerebral embolism, acute valvular dysfunction, and sudden death. In this report, we describe a case of a patient with aortic valve papillary fibroelastoma, which presented with sudden vision loss due to branch retinal artery occlusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the third case of CPF-related retinal artery embolism in English literature.
