 OBJECTIVE: To discuss the death affairs of gynecological patients and find the measurements of down-regulating the mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on the 54 death in-patients in our gynecological department during January 1993 and June 2008. Associated with literature, the data were analyzed according to primary diseases, death causes and clinical demonstrations, in order to probe into the rule of death in gynecological in-patients. RESULTS: The main death causes were gynecological cancers, such as ovarian carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, invasive mole and endometrial carcinoma, which accounted for 79.6 percent (43/54) of gynecological death. Sudden death took up 24 percent (13/54), with death causes of cardio-cerebral vascular events, such as myocardium infarction, pneumonia embolism and cerebral embolism. CONCLUSION: Gynecological oncology is still the main disease threatening women's lives. Emphasis should be put on the physical and surgical complications of the patients. We should attach more importance to the observation and associated treatment of post-operative and post-chemotherapeutic patients with high risks.
