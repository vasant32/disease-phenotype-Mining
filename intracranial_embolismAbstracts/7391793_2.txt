Projectile embolization into the intracranial arterial system is an extremely rare occurrence. Vessel size restricts the entrance of foreign bodies except those of small caliber such as shotgun pellets. Several cases of cervical neck and intracranial projectile emboli resulting from penetrating wounds of the neck and head have been reported. A case of pellet embolization into the intracranial segments of both internal carotid arteries following penetrating pellet wounds of the heart and ascending aorta is presented.
