In an attempt to determine the opinions and practices of neurologists regarding the use of antithrombotic drugs in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, we conducted a survey of 349 randomly selected neurologists from throughout the United States. Responses were received from 247 (71%), and 219 identified themselves as primary or consulting physicians for patients with acute ischemic stroke. During the previous 12 months, these 219 physicians estimated that they had seen a total of 14,636 patients within 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke, and 22% of these patients were treated with heparin. The most frequently reported indications were prevention of recurrent cerebral embolism (82% of physicians) and progressing stroke (70%). Despite the frequent use of heparin, only 6.4% of neurologists felt that it has been shown to be effective, and 16.4% felt that it has been shown to be of no value. The primary concern about the use of heparin was lack of proven efficacy in 48% and safety concerns in 41%. Results of a future trial testing the efficacy of antithrombotic drugs would be useful for most neurologists in their management of patients with acute or progressing ischemic stroke.
