Transcranial Doppler sonography, a new method for the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease, is presented. After outlining the technical basis, investigation technique and normal values, the authors describe the utility of the method for the evaluation of stenosis and occlusions of the extracranial and intracranial arteries, spasms after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, and patients with arrested cerebral circulation due to high intracranial pressure. The value of Doppler methods for the evaluation of cerebrovascular diseases is discussed.
