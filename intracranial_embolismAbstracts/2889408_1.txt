Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were measured serially in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 22 patients with fresh stroke and an equal number of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. It was observed that levels of these enzymes in the CSF of control subjects were very low but were significantly elevated (p less than 0.001) in both serum and CSF in patients with stroke. The elevation was greater in the CSF than in the serum and was maximum during the first four days of stroke. Thereafter, the enzymatic activity declined. Of all these enzymes, GGTP in CSF correlated best with the clinical picture. It was possible to differentiate between the ischemic and hemorrhagic type of stroke on the basis of CSF levels of GGTP (greater than 60.0 units in hemorrhagic stroke). There was no correlation between GGTP levels in CSF and serum or among GOT, GPT, and GGTP in CSF. It can be concluded, therefore, that estimation of GGTP in CSF is helpful not only in predicting the degree of cerebral damage and functional outcome of the patient following stroke but also in differentiating the type of stroke.
