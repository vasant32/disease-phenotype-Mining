We recently encountered a patient with thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus of an idiopathic cause. The patient was treated initially with combined local thrombolytic therapy through the burr hole over the superior sagittal sinus and systemic anticoagulant therapy. Continuous ventricular drainage and hyperbaric oxygenation therapy were used to control the increased intracranial pressure. The superior sagittal sinus was successfully recanalized. Whereas the patient suffered a complication with subacute subdural haematoma, he was successfully treated with the combination of these therapies. The rationale and approach are discussed.
