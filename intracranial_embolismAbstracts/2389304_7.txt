We describe six cases of cerebral venous thrombosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. In one patient, cerebral venous thrombosis was the initial manifestation of lupus; in the five others, it occurred 1-33 years after the diagnosis of lupus. The main clinical features of cerebral venous thrombosis were persistent headache in all six patients, focal symptoms in four, and seizures in three; papilledema was present in only one patient. Cerebral venous thrombosis was diagnosed based on angiography or magnetic resonance imaging. Both the transverse (in five patients) and the superior sagittal (in three) sinuses were involved. Extracranial arterial and/or venous thrombosis were present in three patients, abortion in two, thrombocytopenia in four, and lupus anticoagulant in three. The neurologic symptoms resolved rapidly in five patients treated with steroids and heparin. Cerebral venous thrombosis should be suspected in patients with lupus who complain of persistent headache, especially in the presence of neurologic symptoms.
