The reported analysis of an inquiry study of first-contact physicians was carried out for establishing how the manage cases of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic accident (TIA). The inquiry questionnaire containing questions related to the management of these patients and outpatient diagnosis of patients after stroke or TIA was sent to general practitioners in 4 regions of the country. The form was returned by 159 out of 300 physicians, mostly those working in towns (90.6%). From 53.5% to 64.8% of physicians referred patients with symptoms suggestive of stroke to hospitals, less often were referred those with vision disturbances. Antiplatelet drugs were prescribed to patients with cerebral circulation disturbances by only 12% to 20.3% of the physicians. Only 46.8% of the physicians used anticoagulants as secondary prevention after cerebral embolism from the heart. In patients treated with anticoagulants INR was checked every 2 weeks by 50.9% physicians. Only 42.8% of the physicians referred the patients for USG examination of neck arteries. The analysis showed that too few first-contact physicians referred stroke cases to hospital and too few prescribed antiplatelet drugs for TIA. Anticoagulants were used insufficiently for secondary prevention after cerebral embolism from the heart. There is much to do in stroke cases for management and prevention.
