The article presents data on total calibrometry of the vascular bed of the brain in 26 patients who had died of ischemic cerebral stroke. All patients with nonthrombotic ischemic cerebral stroke showed a considerable decrease in the total lumen of the cerebrovascular bed on the side of the ischemic focus with a significant increase in the coefficient of hemispherical asymmetry. In most cases impoverishment of the hemodynamics was related not to occlusive or gross stenosing process of one of the major vessels but rather to nonmanifest narrowing of several vessels in the hemisphere on the involved side. The coefficient of asymmetry in patients with thrombotic cerebral stroke was the minimal which is explained by the fact that even complete thrombosis of one vessel has no serious effect on the total lumen of the vascular bed of the brain. The findings obtained confirm the theory of the involvement of cerebrovascular insufficiency in the genesis of ischemic cerebral strokes as the main pathogenic component in acute disorders of the cerebral circulation.
