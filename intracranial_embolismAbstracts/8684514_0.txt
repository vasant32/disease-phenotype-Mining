Salicylates increase the risk of hemorrhage. An ischemic brain infarct has not previously been described following intoxication with salicylates. Case report. A 58-year-old comatose patient was admitted with symptoms of a basilar artery thrombosis. A diagnostic angiography was impossible because laboratory results showed a prothrombin time (Quick) of 9% and a toxic salicylate level of 528 mg/l. During the next few days CCT and MRI scans revealed ischemic infarctions within the brain stem. Discussion. Salicylates can induce hemorrhage both by inhibiting platelet aggregation and - especially in higher doses - by vitamin K antagonism, leading to severe coagulopathy. The occurrence of an ischemic infarction, as presented in this case report, can be explained by a reduction of the vitamin K-dependent protein C level.
