The antithrombotic effect of the synthetic thrombin inhibitor (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-[N2-(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfon yl)-L-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid monohydrate (argatroban) was investigated in cerebral vessels of the rat. An occlusive thrombus was formed in pial vessels using a He-Ne laser in a closed cranial window technique. Argatroban retarded the formation of thrombi in a dose-dependent manner. The antithrombotic effect of a single intravenous dose of argatroban at 0.5 mg/kg was diminished after 30 min in arterioles and after 50 min in venules, respectively. The antithrombotic activity was maintained, however, by continuous intravenous infusion (2 mg/kg/h).
