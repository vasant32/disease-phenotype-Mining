The risk of thromboembolism following cardioversion of atrial flutter (AFL) is considered low and anticoagulant treatment (ACT) is not recommended. Nevertheless echocardiographic findings in patients with AFL and several case stories in literature suggest that the risk has been underestimated. Two cases of cerebral embolism are described after cardioversion of AFL in patients without concomitant ACT. Until further studies are available the authors recommend that patients with AFL scheduled for cardioversion receive ACT according to the recommendations for atrial fibrillation.
