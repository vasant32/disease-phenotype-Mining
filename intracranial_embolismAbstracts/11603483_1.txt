Mobile atheroma in the proximal aorta is a risk factor for brain complication after cardiovascular operation. We report a new technique of replacing the ascending and transverse aorta by establishing selective hypothermic antegrade cerebral perfusion. After cooling, cerebral vessels are clamped and systemic perfusion is started. This technique was applied in 5 patients. All patients woke up normally and recovered without neurologic complication.
