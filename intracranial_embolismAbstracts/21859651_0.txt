Atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) is a rare occurrence. Many studies have established a correlation between ASA and both ischemic stroke of unidentified cause and cardiac embolism. We describe the case of a 59-year-old woman who had a giant ASA with patent foramen ovale. The aneurysm was successfully removed. Although the detailed mechanism involved in the degeneration of the atrial septum is unclear, we recommend that such damage be surgically repaired to reduce the risk of cerebral embolism or heart failure in symptomatic patients. Surgery is recommended for larger ASA.
