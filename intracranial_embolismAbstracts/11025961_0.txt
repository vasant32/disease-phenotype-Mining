Right middle cerebral artery embolism by thrombus occurred in 63-year-old female during endovascular embolisation of cerebral aneurysm by Guglielmi detachable coil. Middle cerebral artery occlusion lasted for 60 minute, and haemodynamics was stable during this period. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was detected only by digital subtraction angiography and information from neurosurgeons. Middle cerebral artery blood flow was restored with thrombolytic agents. After tracheal extubation, transient confusion and seizure occurred, but cerebral infarction was not seen in postoperative CT and there was no complication. In case of endovascular embolisation of cerebral aneurysm by Guglielmi detachable coil, systemic heparinization is necessity to decrease the risk of embolism by thrombus, and anesthetist is required to pay attention to cerebral angiography to maintain, close relationship with neurosurgeons and to take measures for cerebral protection.
