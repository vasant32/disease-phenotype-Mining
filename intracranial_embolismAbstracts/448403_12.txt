Over a 1-year period, a 60-year-old woman had nine episodes of transient weakness, clumsiness, and hypesthesia of the right upper extremity. Angiography revealed normal extracranial vessels and a left middle cerebral artery aneurysm. The aneurysmal sac, removed at operation, had an organized thrombus, which was believed to be the cause of the transient ischemic attacks. Postoperatively, the patient has remained free of neurological symptoms.
