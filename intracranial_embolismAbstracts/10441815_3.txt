OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 1) how many patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure were discharged from Austrian hospitals with antithrombotic therapy, 2) if the presence of risk factors for stroke/embolism (age > 65 years, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and previous stroke) influence the choice of antithrombotic therapy and if the presence of contraindications for oral anticoagulation (dementia, alcohol abuse) influence the choice of antithrombotic therapy, and 3) if there are differences among the types of departments in the use of antithrombotic therapy. PATIENTS: Included were 1566 patients (841 female, 725 male, mean age 76 years) with AF and heart failure. METHODS: At discharge, a questionnaire was completed including risk factors, contraindications for antithrombotic therapy, and antithrombotic medication. RESULTS: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) had 26% of the cases, acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) 31%, a combination of OAC and ASA 2%, and no antithrombotic therapy 41%. The risk factors age > 65 years, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and previous stroke did not influence the choice of antithrombotic therapy. Dementia but not alcohol abuse influenced the choice against OAC. The rate of OAC was higher in cardiological or cardiovascular rehabilitation clinics than in other departments. CONCLUSION: The results of this survey show that in medical practice the recommendations regarding antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation are rarely considered, especially when additional risk factors are present.
