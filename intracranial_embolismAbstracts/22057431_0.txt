Several studies have reported the correlation between regional weather patterns and various vascular diseases. However, each vascular disease has inherent characteristics, and the difference of meteorological correlation between these diseases is not well known. This study was aimed at investigating the disparity and intensity of the relationship between meteorological factors and various vascular diseases. A total of 1113 events within 2 years were included in this study. Daily meteorological parameters with and without events were, respectively, compared in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cerebral infarction (CI), cerebral embolism (CE), cerebral hemorrhage (CH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), aortic dissection (AD), and aortic aneurysm rupture (AAR). Days with CI onset correlated with fewer sunshine hours, fewer solar radiation factors, greater amounts of precipitation factors, and more humidity factors, whereas CH and CE only showed lower correlation in temperature factors. However, there was no relation seen between ACS, SAH, AD, AAR, and climatic parameters. Our findings suggest that climate affects various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases differently. This finding may help in understanding the mechanism of how vascular events are triggered.
