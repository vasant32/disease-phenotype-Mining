A 13-year-old boy presented with acute stroke leading to right-sided hemiparesis. A contrast CT scan of the brain showed a hemorrhagic infarct in the left basal ganglia region with surrounding edema. Echocardiography showed a hydatid cyst in the right atrial chamber extending into the left atrium. A single hepatic hydatid was also seen.
