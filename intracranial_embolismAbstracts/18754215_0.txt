An eight-year-old female developed cerebral infarction, with eventual brain death, as a consequence of therapeutic embolisation of a large facial haemangioma. Post-mortem histological examination revealed the presence of identical foreign body emboli, consistent with at least one of the embolic agents used in the procedure, within the haemangioma and both cerebral hemispheres. It is possible that some of these particles might have entered the cerebral circulation through anastomoses between the right external and internal carotid arteries, and subsequently crossed over from the ipsilateral to the contralateral cerebral vasculature via the Arterial Circle of Willis.
