In a 14-year-old boy, neurological signs (fall in visual acuity, signs of raised intracranial pressure) led to a diagnosis of stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Cure was obtained by insertion of a ventriculo-cardiac bypass (Holter's valve). Endocrine signs (delayed growth, excessweight, loss of circadian variations in cortisol levels) regressed in a few months after the operation. Amongst endocrine manifestations of stenosis of the aqueduct, delayed growth and disturbances in gonadal function are the most common, together with obesity. They usually regress after neurosurgical treatment.
