Percutaneous nonsurgical closure is an alternative to surgical repair of a significant atrial septal defect (ASD) or a patent foramen ovale (PFO) associated with systemic embolism without other cause. We report the results of the first 35 patients (19 ASDs, 16 PFOs) in whom transcatheter closure was attempted. Diagnosis and follow-up were based on transesophageal echocardiography in the majority of cases. In all patients the "Sideris buttoned device" was used. A total of 19 patients (13 women) were treated for symptomatic ASD of the secundum type. The mean defect size before the intervention was 17 mm by echocardiography and 24 mm measured by balloon in the catheterization laboratory (stretched diameter) with a reduction to 4 mm after treatment measured by echocardiography. A total of 16 patients (5 women) underwent transcatheter closure of a PFO; 14 patients had had cerebral embolic events and 2 peripheral. During follow-up of 104 patient months, only one patient had a recurrent embolic event. He had at that time no occluder protecting the PFO after early embolization and extraction of the device.
