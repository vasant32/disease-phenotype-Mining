Transcranial Doppler monitoring of the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity was used as an adjunct to routine methods of cerebral monitoring in a prospective study of 30 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy to investigate whether transcranial Doppler monitoring provided information influencing operative technique. Application of carotid clamps caused a significant fall in middle cerebral artery velocity and there was a linear relationship between middle cerebral artery velocity and internal carotid artery stump pressure. Assuming a stump pressure of less than 50 mmHg to be an indication for shunting, this would correspond to a systolic middle cerebral artery velocity of less than 42 cm/s and a mean velocity of less than 30 cm/s. Transcranial Doppler monitoring immediately identified problems with shunt function and demonstrated a higher frequency of intraoperative embolization than had been anticipated, particularly after shunt insertion and final restoration of flow. With revision of operative technique this phenomenon is rarely encountered now. Two of the 30 patients exhibited a minor neurological deficit on recovery of consciousness, and transcranial Doppler monitoring was able to identify the probable underlying cause in both cases. Unnecessary and potentially hazardous re-exploration was avoided. In the absence of transcranial Doppler monitoring the neurological deficit in one of the patients might have been much worse.
