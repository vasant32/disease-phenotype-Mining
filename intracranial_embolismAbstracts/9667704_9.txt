BACKGROUND: Patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis greater than 70 per cent in association with a contralateral ICA occlusion may have an increased risk of stroke following carotid endarterectomy. Such patients might benefit from the theoretically shorter ischaemic time offered by carotid angioplasty and stenting. METHODS: Nine patients who underwent carotid angioplasty and stenting were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy, continuous jugular venous oximetry and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to detect both haemodynamic ischaemia and embolic events. RESULTS: Significant ischaemia occurred in four of the nine patients once the stenosis had been crossed by the guidewire (spectroscopy and oximetry). Inflation of the angioplasty balloon resulted in a brief period of ischaemia and showers of emboli in all patients (ultrasonography) and this persisted for more than 3 min after balloon deflation in three patients. One patient had a major disabling stroke due to ICA thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Angioplasty and stenting in these high-risk patients may not confer any advantage over conventional surgery in terms of both haemodynamic ischaemia and embolization.
