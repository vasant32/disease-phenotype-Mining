Arterial embolization with cyanoacrylate is commonly used for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations. We report the case of a 40 years old man who four days after an embolization with cyanoacrylate, begins with cough, bloody sputum, and right hemithorax pleuritic pain. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed with chest X ray, CT scan and scyntigraphy. The patient received anticoagulation, with adequate response. The most common complications of cerebral embolization are related to central nervous system and pulmonary embolism is exceptional. Considering the high number of embolization procedures done nowadays, this complication must be borne in mind.
