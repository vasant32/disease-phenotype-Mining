Cerebral embolic infarction is the most common neurologic complication of cardiac myxoma (CM). Development of cerebral aneurysms in CM is very rare. We present a 64-year-old woman with acute cerebral infarction and multiple cerebral aneurysms complicated by CM. The aneurysms were multiple, fusiform-shaped, and located in distal branch of major cerebral arteries. The serum interleukin (IL)-6 was highly elevated, which was normalized after surgical resection of CM. There was no regression of aneurysms on follow-up neuroimaging. Multiple cerebral aneurysms in CM are rare condition. Highly elevated serum IL-6 may be associated with increased risk of cerebral aneurysmal formation.
