The levels of somatostatin (SS) in CSF and blood and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) in plasma were measured by radioimmunoassay in 64 patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular diseases (ICVD), randomly divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 31, both electro-acupuncture and routine treatments given) and group 2 (n = 33, routine treatment) and 26 non-ICVD patients were used as controls. The points of electro-acupuncture were Quchi (LI 12), Waiguan (SJ 5) and Huantiao (GB 30) and Zusanli (St 36). After a course of treatment, the SS levels in plasma and CSF were significantly increased in the patients of group 1 with good result and their plasma PP level had no significant change. In the patients with poor result, however, the PP level was significantly decreased. The results suggested that electro-acupuncture might play an active role in alleviating the SS metabolic disturbance in CNS of ICVD patients.
