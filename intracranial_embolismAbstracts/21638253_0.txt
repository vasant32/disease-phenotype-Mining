We report three cases with concomitant ipsilateral proximal common carotid and internal carotid artery stenosis treated in one stage with carotid endarterectomy and retrograde primary stenting of the common carotid artery. The internal carotid artery was clamped during stenting to avoid cerebral embolization. All procedures were successfully completed and all patients remain asymptomatic at 18 months follow up. The one-stage hybrid approach appears to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of ipsilateral multifocal significant lesions.
