BACKGROUND: Stroke caused by spontaneous thrombosis of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm is a rare event. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old woman experienced a transient ischemic attack and cerebral infarctions due to spontaneous thrombosis of an unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Extension of thrombus into both anterior cerebral arteries and the left middle cerebral artery, resulting in ischemic infarction in all three vascular territories, was diagnosed by CT scanning, MRI, and cerebral angiography and confirmed at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates a rare complication of an unruptured saccular aneurysm with neuroimaging and pathological correlation. Morphological and hemodynamic factors that may have precipitated aneurysm thrombosis are discussed with reference to experimental models.
