A rare congenital myocardial defect, known as left ventricular hypertrabeculation/non-compaction (LVHT), has been occasionally described associated with thrombus formation with a potential systemic embolic risk, but its association with ischemic strokes remains controversial. We report a case of ischemic stroke in a patient with severe LVHT and ventricular dysfunction as a possible etiologic synergistic association. In absence of other embolic sources, a severe LVTH associated with ventricular dysfunction could constitute a potential source of brain embolism, especially in patients with high suspicion of an embolic mechanism of ischemic stroke.
