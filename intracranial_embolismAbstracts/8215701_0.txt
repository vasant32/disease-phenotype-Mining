The aim of this study was the evaluation of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the detection of potential emboli sources of cardiac origin in a young population with cerebrovascular events, and to compare this study with transthoracic echocardiography (TE). We have studied 24 young subjects (average 33 years) and detected a potential cardiac source in 9 subjects, with transthoracic approach only in 4. We concluded that TEE is superior than TE to detect potential cardiac source of cerebral embolism. The most frequently abnormality was mitral valve prolapse.
