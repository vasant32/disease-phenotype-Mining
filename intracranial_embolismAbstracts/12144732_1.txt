The authors report on the case of a patient with infective endocarditis of a prosthetic valve in the aortic position, after receiving percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Transesophageal echocardiography provided valuable information about the existence and size of vegetations at the time of initial diagnosis and during followup. Despite successful treatment resulting in good control of the infection and a significant reduction of vegetation size, the patient still suffered a major cerebral embolic event early after hospital discharge.
