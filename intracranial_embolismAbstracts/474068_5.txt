The etiology of cerebrovascular thrombosis in normotensives has not been elucidated. This controlled retrospective study examines the association between alcoholism and cerebrovascular thrombosis in patients under age 50. The hospital records of 49 patients under age 50 with a diagnosis of cerebrovascular thrombosis without hypertension were reviewed for possible predisposing factors. Alcohol abuse is the one common denominator among the males in the study.
