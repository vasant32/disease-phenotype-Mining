One hundred forty-one patients with cerebral or cerebellar infarction were examined by computed tomography (CT) as soon after the ictus as possible. The examination was repeated in 7 days, and a radionuclide brain scan was performed. The overall detection rate for ischemic infarction was approximately equal for both techniques, ranging from 58% for radionuclide scanning to 66% for the delayed CT. Almost half of the supratentorial infarcts examined by CT on the day of the ictus were demonstrated. Mass effect was observed as early as the first day and as late as the 25th day.
