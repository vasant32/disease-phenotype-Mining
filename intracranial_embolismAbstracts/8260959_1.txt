Post-traumatic thrombosis of cavernous sinus and orbital veins has been reported in conjunction with carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (CCSF). CCSF are abnormal communications between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. Spontaneous thrombosis of a CCSF is a rare event mainly seen in the indirect (dural) type of fistula. We report on a patient with a possible post-traumatic CSSF which underwent partial spontaneous thrombosis and presented with an extreme degree of proptosis.
