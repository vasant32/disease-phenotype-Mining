An 18-year-old woman underwent the repair of traumatic lacerations of the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and interventricular septum. At the time of surgery, an indwelling left atrial catheter was placed for postoperative hemodynamic manangement. An attempt to remove the catheter completely several days following surgery was unsuccessful, but it was initially assumed by the surgeon that the tip of the catheter had been withdrawn from the left atrium. When the patient developed neurologic signs suggesting a cerebral embolism, an echocardiogram was performed. Echo demonstration of the catheter in the left atrium led to repeat thoracotomy for removal of the retained line. Baseline echocardiograms are indicated in cardiac surgical patients with indwelling left atrial catheters and echo study can be diagnostic if catheter retention occurs.
