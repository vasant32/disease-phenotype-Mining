This paper introduces a new index for the assessment of regional cerebral blood flow. The index is proportional to total flow, and is obtained from the ratio of regional count rate to arterial indicator input to a region. This index is a more sensitive indicator of impaired perfusion than the traditional flow rate indices which express flow per unit mass of tissue per minute. It accounts for brain tissue partly or totally deprived of its blood supply. Examples of clinical application are reported. A good correlation with the findings of computer-assisted tomography has been found.
