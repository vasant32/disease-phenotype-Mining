Two previously healthy children experienced serious neurologic complications in the course of severe S. aureus septicaemia. The first patient developed right hemiparesis and stupor due to a left frontal abscess. He recovered completely following surgery. The second patient, admitted with signs of meningeal infection, developed acute bacterial endocarditis followed by late cerebral embolism causing coma and death. In both patients, cerebral CT was a useful rapid diagnostic acid. When the S. aureus septicaemic patient develops acute bacterial endocarditis, regardless of his haemodynamic state, early valve replacement may prevent harmful cerebral embolic phenomena.
