Osteogenic sarcoma frequently disseminates by hematogenous routes. A 32-year-old patient underwent evaluation for an acute cerebral infarction. Cardiac auscultation disclosed an abnormal diastolic sound. Echocardiographic examination revealed a large left atrial mass, which was found at thoracotomy to be metastatic osteogenic sarcoma. Cerebral computed tomographic scans at the time of initial examination and 3 months later demonstrated new cerebral lesions consistent with metastatic growths. The abrupt cerebral infarction, other clinical findings, and results of diagnostic studies strongly suggested that the acute cerebrovascular event was the result of metastatic cerebral embolization from the tumor material found in the thorax. Cerebral infarction is an unusual and catastrophic complication of thoracic metastatic lesions of osteogenic sarcoma.
