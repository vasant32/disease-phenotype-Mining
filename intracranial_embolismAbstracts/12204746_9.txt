The nitinol TrapEase inferior vena cava filter is a new device for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis. No cases of filter migration or filter-related complications with this type of device have so far been described. We report a case of intracardiac migration of this filter in a patient with a patent foramen ovale, resulting in severe cardiogenic shock, cerebral and right arm paradoxical embolism. Surgical treatment, results, causes of these complications are discussed.
