A rare complication of transbronchoscopic lung biopsy, namely a cerebral air embolism, is presented. The course of events following the embolic episode in the form of a fall in blood pressure, bradycardia and convulsions is documented, as is the presence of an air emboli on the CT scan of the brain with subsequent resorption of the emboli on the follow-up scan. The salient features of the case are the rarity of the complication and the excellent temporal depiction of imaging findings on CT scan demonstrated as resorption of air emboli and subsequent watershed territory infarcts.
