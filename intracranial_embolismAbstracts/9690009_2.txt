A rare case of transient hydrocephalus is reported. A 64-year-old woman presented with headache. Computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed hydrocephalus with tiny blood clots in the left foramen of Monro and in the aqueduct. Six hours after the onset, the signs and symptoms disappeared spontaneously. The second CT showed improvement of the hydrocephalus with migration of the clot into the i.v. ventricle. Aqueductal trapping and releasing of the clot formed by bleeding from the choroid plexus located in the left foramen of Monro was suspected for the origin of the transient hydrocephalus.
