Cerebral infarction in children may be the result of various disease processes, including emboli from intracardiac sources, paradoxical emboli from the venous system, sickle cell disease, cyanotic heart disease, vasculitis affecting the carotid or cerebral vascular system, vascular anomalies, and prothrombotic states. We present a previously healthy adolescent who presented with the acute onset of hemiparesis. Work-up revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular mural thrombus as the etiology of his cerebrovascular event. Although dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) may predispose to the development of a mural thrombus and subsequent embolic events, there are no previous reports in pediatric-aged patients of the development of an embolic event as the presenting manifestation of DCM. Further investigation of the etiology of the DCM led to the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma. Congestive heart failure and DCM as the presenting sign of pheochromocytoma has likewise not been reported in a pediatric-aged patient. We review this unlikely sequence of events, the diagnostic evaluation of such patients, and treatment options.
