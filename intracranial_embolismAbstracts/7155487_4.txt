Bacterial endocarditis in pregnancy is uncommon but serious. A case is presented of subacute bacterial endocarditis with severe aortic and mitral valvular insufficiency and with associated multiple systemic and cerebral emboli. Therapy consisted of cesarean section at 33 weeks' gestation followed by aortic and mitral valve replacement; there was no maternal or fetal mortality. The English literature on infective endocarditis complicating pregnancy is reviewed.
