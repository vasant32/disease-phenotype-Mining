African-Americans and probably Latinos are at increased risk of stroke compared with white, non-Latino Americans. This study seeks to determine if the known risk factors for stroke can account for this increased risk. In this case-control study controls (neighborhood volunteers) were group-matched to acute stroke cases by ethnicity in a ratio of approximately 2:1 for African-Americans and Latinos and 1:1 for whites. Extensive historical, clinical and laboratory data were collected on each subject. For each ethnic group cases were somewhat older and less well-educated than the volunteer controls. Patients in each ethnic group were similar with regard to time from stroke onset to hospital admission, stroke severity, length of stay, discharge disposition and mortality rate. With minor exceptions the distributions of stroke subtypes within each ethnic group appeared similar to those previously reported. Subject recruitment for this case-control study was completed in the manner and time frame planned. Analysis of risk factor information from this sample should provide valuable information regarding the relative risk associated with the major modifiable risk factors for stroke in the minority groups studied.
