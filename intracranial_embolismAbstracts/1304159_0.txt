BACKGROUND: Aneurysm of the interatrial septum is a potential cause of systemic embolism, but it is rarely responsible for a cerebral embolism in childhood. CASE REPORT: A girl, aged 14 years, presented with a sudden right hemiplegia. The coagulation factors were normal, as was the CSF. The CT scan was normal and the EEG showed some theta waves (3-4/s) on the left temporal lobe. MRI, performed 6 days later, showed ischemic lesions leading to a search for the origin of the embolism. One-dimensional echocardiography revealed no abnormality, but two-dimensional echocardiography showed an aneurysm of the interatrial septum bulging into the right atrium. The child was treated with low doses of acetylsalicylic acid, but still had a moderate degree of spastic hemiplegia one year later. CONCLUSION: Cardiopathies can be among the causes of cerebral embolism in children. An aneurysm of the interatrial septum requires treatment throughout patient's life.
