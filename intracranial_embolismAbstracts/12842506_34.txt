BACKGROUND: Neurologic and clinical morbidity after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be significant. By avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass, off-pump CABG (OPCAB) may reduce morbidity. METHODS: Sixty patients (30 CABG and 30 OPCAB) were prospectively randomized. Neurocognitive testing was performed before the operation and 2 weeks and 1 year after the operation. Neurologic testing to detect stroke and (99m)Tc-HMPAO whole-brain single photon emission computed tomography scanning to assess cerebral perfusion were performed before the operation and 3 days afterward. Bilateral middle cerebral artery transcranial Doppler scanning was performed intraoperatively to detect cerebral microemboli. All examiners were blinded to treatment group. Clinical morbidity and costs were compared. RESULTS: Coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with more cerebral microemboli (575 +/- 278.5 CABG versus 16.0 +/- 19.5 OPCAB (median +/- semiinterquartile range) and significantly reduced cerebral perfusion after the operation to the bilateral occipital, cerebellar, precunei, thalami, and left temporal lobes (p < or = 0.01). Cerebral perfusion with OPCAB was unchanged. Compared with base line, OPCAB patients performed better on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (total and recognition scores) at both 2 weeks and at 1 year (p < or = 0.05), whereas CABG performance was statistically unchanged for all cognitive measures. Patients who underwent CABG had more chest tube drainage (1389 +/- 1256 mL CABG versus 789 +/- 586 mL OPCAB, p = 0.02) and required more blood (3.9 +/- 5.8 U CABG versus 1.2 +/- 2.2 U OPCAB, p = 0.02), fresh frozen plasma (3.0 +/- 6.0 U CABG versus 0.5 +/- 2.2 U OPCAB, p = 0.03), and hours of postoperative use of dopamine (16.3 +/- 21.2 hours CABG versus 7.3 +/- 9.7 hours OPCAB, p = 0.04). These differences culminated in higher costs for CABG ($23,053 +/- $5,320 CABG versus $17,780 +/- $4,390 OPCAB, p < 0.0001). One stroke occurred with CABG, compared with none with OPCAB (p = NS). One OPCAB patient died because of a pulmonary embolus (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CABG, OPCAB may reduce neurologic and clinical morbidity as well as cost.
