We report a 45-year-old woman with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). Because of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, she underwent tricuspid valvular replacement and warfarin was prescribed. She suddenly had dysarthria, left hemiparesis and left hemispatial neglect. After brain CT examination, and cerebral angiography, she was diagnosed as cardiogenic brain embolism and infusion of low molecular heparin was started. On day 25, she suddenly had ventricular tachycardia and died in spite of treatment for arrhythmia. This is the first report of the case of cardiogenic brain embolism following ARVD. In this type of case, we must take care of arrhythmia besides the management of atrial fibrillation and brain infarction.
