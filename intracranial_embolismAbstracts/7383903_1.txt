The occurence of arterial and, more frequently, venous thrombosis in patients with the nephrotic syndrome is well documented. Several factors are involved among which the fall in plasma albumin, the rise of several coagulation factors, platelet hyperreactivity, decrease of antithrombin III. We report here the first case, to our knowledge, of a dural sinus thrombosis, complicating a nephrotic syndrome with minimal glomerular changes. The difficulties of such a diagnosis and the key value of carotid angiography to establish it are emphasized. The use of anticoagulants can prevent this complication.
