A case of angiographically-documented embolism is presented in a patient using oral contraceptives (OC) with marked mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and an atrial thrombus. OC use has been shown to decrease levels of antithrombin III and increase platelet coagulant activity. This increased coagulability may increase the risk of intra-atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral embolism in patients with MVP. We believe that MVP, especially when redundant valve leaflets are recognized, may be a relative contraindication to OC use.
