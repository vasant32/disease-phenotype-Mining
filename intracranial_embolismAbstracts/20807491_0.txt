Cardiac tumor is a rare, but clinically important source of cerebral embolism. We report a case of metastatic chondrosarcoma in the left atrium with multiple cerebral emboli. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed a large mass in the left atrium and pulmonary vein. The patient underwent heart surgery to remove the metastatic chondrosarcoma in the left atrium, to prevent the formation of further systemic emboli and possible sudden death. The cardiac tumor resection was successful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital without any handicap. This is a rare case of metastatic cardiac tumor that was a source of emboli into the brain and was eradicated.
