A rare case of thrombosed AVM presenting temporal lobe epilepsy is reported. A 27-year old man was admitted to our hospital because of a 7-year history of temporal lobe epilepsy. He had also suffered from generalized seizure since he was 6 years old. No neurological deficit was disclosed. CT scan demonstrated a small calcified mass lesion in the left temporal lobe which was not enhanced by contrast study. Skull X - P and cerebral angiography were normal. Low intensity area on T1-weighted MR image corresponded to the high density area on CT scan. T2-weighted MR image demonstrated that peripheral low intensity area was more prominent and extensive. Conventional EEG showed focal spike discharges from the left fronto-central lead, and subdural EEG recordings showed intermittent spike discharges from the medial side of the left temporal lobe. A 5 cm temporal lobectomy was performed and a thick fibrous mass adjacent to the hippocampoamygdala complex was removed. Histopathological examination demonstrated a thrombosed AVM surrounded by gliotic neural tissue.
