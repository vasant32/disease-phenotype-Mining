In 75 patients with neurological symptoms due to RCI serum fibrinogen, whole blood viscosity and platelet aggregability have been determined before treatment was started. In addition, in 24 of the patients also HBF has been measured. In patients with RCI viscosity was significantly increased. Serum fibrinogen was higher at increased viscosity levels and when enhanced platelet aggregation was evident. At low shear rates increased blood viscosity correlated significantly with serum fibrinogen as well as with reduction of HBF.
