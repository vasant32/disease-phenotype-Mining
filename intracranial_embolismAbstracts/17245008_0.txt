Examination of embolectomy using the Merci Retrieval System using experimental stroke models demonstrated that aspiration is not adequate to remove larger clots. The effectiveness of filter trapping was examined using the same models. A silicone model of the carotid artery system with model blood clot was incorporated in a laboratory pulsatile flow system. Embolectomy was performed using the Merci Retrieval System. Any clot not evacuated through the balloon guide catheter was trapped with a distal protection filter device developed for cervical stenting. The clot could not be sucked into the guide catheter by the recommended procedures in nine of 15 trials. Trapping failed in only one trial, in which the clot passed through a gap between the edge of the filter orifice and the inner model lumen. A clot was withdrawn to the catheter tip trapped across the edge of the orifice frame in one trial, and a very large clot was trapped across the filter orifice in two trials. Even clots made by the same method showed variation in properties, especially hardness, which may affect the effectiveness of aspiration. The aspiration procedure recommended for the Merci Retrieval System did not remove the large clots formed by embolectomy. The trapping procedure using a filter device without an orifice frame was effective to solve this problem.
