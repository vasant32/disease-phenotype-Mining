The indices of hospital lethality in cerebral strokes to a great extent depend upon the percentage of hospitalized patients and the contingent of admitted patients by their severity. For this reason the indices of hospital lethality cannot serve as a criteria for the quality of hospital services in this form of disorder. The coefficient of general lethality is also inadequate for the characteristics of changes in the therapeutic effectiveness of patients with acute changes of cerebral circulation, inasmuch as it does not take into consideration the decisive significance of the duration, character of disorders of cerebral circulation and the main vascular disease. The most complete characteristics of changes and therapeutic effectiveness in patients with cerebral strokes may be received only from survival coefficient of patients, homogenous according to the main vascular disease, character of disturbed cerebral circulation, age and sex of the patients.
