A prospective study of Nigerian children with sickle cell disease was undertaken to determine serum levels of antithrombin III (AT-III) and compare these with normal controls. Mean serum AT-III was significantly lower in patients than in controls (14.51 +/- 4.84 mg/dl and 17.75 +/- 5.92 mg/dl) respectively. Seven of the 49 sickle cell patients had AT-III levels below 50% of normal values. Mean platelet counts were significantly higher in sicklers than in normal controls. AT-III deficiency may predispose to thrombotic complications in children with sickle cell disease.
