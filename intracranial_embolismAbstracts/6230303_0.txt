This report concerns an unusual case of thrombosis and hemorrhage in the choroid plexus caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The case is of special interest because it occurred in a patient with Down's syndrome. Nevertheless, there is no causal relation between Down's syndrome and the choroid plexus lesion except that mongols are susceptible to infections that trigger DIC. The association of choroid plexus thrombosis-hemorrhage and Down's syndrome is coincidental and does not indicate a basic vascular defect.
