Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of supra-aortic arteries is not generally accepted, mainly because of the fear of brain embolism. The design of a new catheter offers four conduits and permits (1) guidewire conduct, (2) tip occlusion; (3) PTA; and (4) rinsing between occluded tip and dilational balloon. Thus, any particles that might otherwise cause brain embolism could be washed out after PTA and before opening of the tip occlusion. The prototype has already been manufactured. The catheter is easy to handle.
