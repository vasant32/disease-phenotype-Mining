In a prospective population-based study the cumulative utilization of health care resources (and the rehabilitation outcome) was followed in consecutive stroke patients 3, 6 and 12 months after the onset of the disease. The study group comprised 258 patients diseased during the period February 1st 1986-January 31th 1987. The pattern of various forms of hospital beds and non-hospital facilities in open care utilized during the first post-stroke year was analysed at 1986 year's cost level. The mean utilization of acute hospital beds during the initial phase was 15 days; at an expenditure cost of 26,670 SEK ($3,683). The mean utilization of acute hospital and of geriatric beds during the first year was 19 and 59 days respectively. Thus the total hospital bed days amounted to a mean of 78 days; at a mean expenditure of 87,0000 SEK ($12,000); 70% of the patients were discharged from hospital care to independent living after 36 days. The acute care hospital provided 36% and geriatric care 64% of the beds needed before discharge. The expenditure of non-hospital facilities was mean 19,000 SEK ($2600); thus total expenditure for health care amounted to 106,000 SEK ($14,600). The relation between non-hospital and hospital care was approximately 1 to 5. Severity of the stroke influenced markedly the pattern and the total utilization of both hospital and non-hospital care. Patients with major stroke utilized health care resources at an expenditure 3.5 times that used by patients with minor stroke. Age of the patient also influenced health care utilization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
