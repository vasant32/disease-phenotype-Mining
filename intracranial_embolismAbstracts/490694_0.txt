Post-traumatic thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is uncommon: only 39 cases were found in the literature. In the present report, eight cases of post-traumatic MCA thrombosis are analyzed and compared with other reported cases. The symptoms can be easily confused with those of expanding intracranial hematoma. Although ancillary noninvasive diagnostic methods are helpful, cerebral angiography confirms the diagnosis. The morbidity and mortality rates are high, and treatment has been mainly supportive. The low mortality in the present study may be related to the absence of severe head or other trauma. Possible cerebral revascularization procedures are also discussed.
