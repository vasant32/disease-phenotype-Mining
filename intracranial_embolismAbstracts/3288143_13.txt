Noninvasive in vivo detection of gaseous microemboli in the middle cerebral artery, by transcranial Doppler ultrasound, was used to determine the effect of filtration in the arterial catheter using 25- and 40-microns filters and bubble oxygenators in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Eighteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were studied using a closed cardiac (unvented heart) model. Group 1 patients (no filters) had the highest incidence of gaseous microemboli, as indicated by the ultrasound microemboli index, at both high and low oxygen flow rates. Group 2 patients (40-microns filters) had a significantly lower microemboli index, particularly at low oxygen flow rates (t = 4.9, p less than 0.001). The 25-microns group patients had the lowest values of all. No microemboli were detected at low oxygen flow rates, and microemboli were detected in only 0.1% of the samples at high oxygen flow rates. Additionally, observations on vented hearts in 3 patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery indicate that the origin of gaseous microemboli may be air trapped inside the heart.
