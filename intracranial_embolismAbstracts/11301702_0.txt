BACKGROUND: Myxomas are the most common type of primary cardiac tumours. As they are most often located in the left atrium, primary neurological manifestations are often multiple embolic infarcts in the central nervous system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe a patient with acute aphasia due to left temporal haemorrhage. Later he developed acute ataxia due to right cerebellar infarct. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance also showed multiple supra- and infratentorial infarcts. Echocardiography revealed a myxoma in the left atrium which was treated by surgical excision. There were no signs of myxoma recurrence or embolic infarcts at follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Echocardiography should be included in the diagnostic work-up of patients with cerebrovascular events, especially in young patients with multiple infarcts.
