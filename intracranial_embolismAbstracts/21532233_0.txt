Midventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (MOHC) is a rare form of cardiomyopathy that was demonstrated to have caused embolic stroke in two patients. In both cases, the embolic sources of stroke were thrombi in an apical aneurysm caused by turbulent stasis of blood flow and subsequent injury of myocardial endocardium. Even without atrial fibrillation, apical aneurysm can induce emboligenic stroke in MOHC.
