The purpose of this retrospective study was to demonstrate the MRI features of cerebral manifestations in patients with fat embolism syndromes in comparison with cerebral CT (CCT). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed according to standard protocols revealing multiple small non-confluent hyperintense intracerebral lesions larger than 2 mm on proton-density and T2-weighted images to various extents in three of four patients with clinically suspected cerebral fat embolism. Cerebral CT was negative in all patients. Our findings confirm that MRI can detect cerebral fat embolism with a higher sensitivity than CCT. Thus, MRI should be the first choice for imaging of cerebral fat embolism.
