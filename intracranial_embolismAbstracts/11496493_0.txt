The article is devoted to the problem of diagnosis and treatment of 28 patients with cranio-cerebral injury with posttraumatic fat embolism. In 15 of them fat liquoroglobulia was diagnosed which is a reliable symptom of the cerebral form of fat embolism. The method of detection of fat liquoroglobulia is described. A new method--liquorosorption--was used in treatment of patients with the cerebral form of fat embolism. A disturbance of the hematoencephalic barrier is thought by the authors to be possible in such embolism.
