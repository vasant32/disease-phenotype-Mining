From 1980 to 1994, 11 cases of multiple intracavitary myxomas were treated. Among them, 8 cases were in two chambers of the heart, and 3 in three chambes. 31 cardiac myxomas were removed in consecutive cases. The postoperative early results were good, but late results were unsatisfactory. 5 cases relapsed. Three cases died of cerebral embolism, and 2 were operated in postoperative relapse. Others survived over 10 years after surgery. The main points discussed are as follows: clinical characteristic for multiple intracavitary myxomas; echocardiographic diagnosis; selection of incision; postoperative relapse.
