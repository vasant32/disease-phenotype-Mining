BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transesophageal echocardiography frequently demonstrates aortic atheroma in patients with cerebral and peripheral emboli. The aim of this study was to determine whether atheroma in the ascending aorta and arch is an independent risk factor for cerebral ischemia. METHODS: We studied 215 consecutive patients with a first stroke or transient ischemic attack and 202 community-based control subjects using transesophageal echocardiography to detect aortic atheroma and potential cardiac sources for embolism. Information about other stroke risk factors was obtained from a structured interview, and the presence of carotid vascular disease was assessed by means of duplex ultrasonography or digital subtraction angiography. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine adjusted odds ratios for each risk factor. RESULTS: Atheroma in the ascending aorta and aortic arch was a significant risk factor for cerebral ischemia, independent of other well-established risk factors including high-grade carotid stenosis. The odds ratio for simple atheroma was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 4.2) and for complex atheroma 7.1 (2.7 to 18.4). CONCLUSIONS: Ascending aortic and arch atheroma detected by transesophageal echocardiography is an important new independent risk factor for cerebral ischemia. Further characterization of the embolic potential of atheroma with different echocardiographic appearances and development of optimal management strategies are now needed.
