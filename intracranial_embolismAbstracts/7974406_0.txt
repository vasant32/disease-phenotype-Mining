The authors describe five years of experience of embolization in arteriovenous malformations and fistulas, aneurysms and tumours of the central nervous system and head and neck. Altogether 143 patients were embolized in 185 sessions. Polyvinyl alcohol particles and platinum fibre coils were used as embolic agents. Permanent complications were rare, e.g 5% in arteriovenous malformations of the brain. Embolizations were either complete or preoperatively incomplete and seemed to positively influence the final outcome for the patients. The authors advocate a policy which gives due consideration to the volume of patients who might benefit from this specialized neuroradiological activity.
