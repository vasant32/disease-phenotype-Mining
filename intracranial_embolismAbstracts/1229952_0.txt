On the occasion of a new case of intraparietal hematoma of the basilar artery in a 22-year-old male the authors connect this lesion with an anatomoclinical entity which may be called "obliterating parietal hemodissection". It occurs in the cerebral vessels (sylvian or basilar artery) free from any alteration type athero-sclerosis, syphilis or medianecrosis. The anomaly of the elastic fibers risks to fail to be recognized if it is not systematically serchead for in all cases of apparently primary thrombosis occuring in the cerebral vessels.
