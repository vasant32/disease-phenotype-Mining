 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although hypercoagulability-induced thromboembolism is generally accepted as cause of cerebral ischaemia in thalassemic patients, cardiogenic embolism has been recently suggested as another possible stroke etiology. METHODS: We present four adult β-thalassemia major patients with manifest cardiac involvement who suffered territorial strokes. RESULTS: In the presence of siderotoxic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, we assumed cardiogenic embolism as etiology of stroke and initiated oral anticoagulation as preventive medication. Two of our patients were the first β-thalassemia major patients who underwent successful thrombolysis with rtPA. CONCLUSIONS: Cardioembolism seems to be the cause of stroke in cases of β-thalassemia major. Thrombolysis can be applied in the setting of acute brain ischaemia in such high risk patients.
