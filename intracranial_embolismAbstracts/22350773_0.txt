The immediate complication after implantation of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is more often bleeding than thromboembolic events. We report an unusual case of massive thrombus formation following systemic thrombolytic therapy which happened twice after implantation of MCS. Various mechanisms may contribute to this severe complication, but attention should be paid to patients who receive MCS after systemic thrombolysis because of the secondary hypercoagulability induced by this therapy.
