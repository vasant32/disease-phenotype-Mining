Cerebral vein thrombosis is a rare condition and its prognosis depends on prompt diagnosis and therapy. Computer Tomography findings in this condition are described and correlated with their pathologic-anatomic findings, based on cases of our own and those described in the literature. Computer Tomography findings rarely are pathognomonic. Therefore, indirect findings are pointed out and discussed which support the diagnosis such as simultaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage.
