Convulsions have not been emphasized as a possible complication of carotid endarterectomy. We describe here three patients in whom seizures with a focal component developed postoperatively. We suspect that the convulsions were secondary to a cerebral embolus arising from the operative site. An unstable preoperative neurological status is not a prerequisite for this complication.
