In children, clinical recognition of stroke and determination of its exact etiology are extremely difficult. The authors described a case of cryptogenic stroke in a 14-year-old-boy with asymptomatic atrial septal defect and hypercoagulable state. Paradoxical embolism was hypothesized as the responsible etiopathological mechanism. It is crucial to increase clinician awareness of stroke in children.
