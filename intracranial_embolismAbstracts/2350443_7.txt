The autopsy records of adult patients dying with AIDS between 1983 and 1987 at a large, metropolitan, university-affiliated hospital were reviewed to determine the incidence and spectrum of cerebrovascular and associated cardiovascular disease. The clinical records of those patients with AIDS with cerebrovascular disease were retrospectively examined in detail. All autopsied patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years dying without AIDS in 1986 and 1987 served as the control group. At autopsy, 13 (8%) of 154 adult patients with AIDS had evidence of recent cerebrovascular disease. In comparison, 25 (23%) of the 111 control patients dying without AIDS had recent cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.04). The spectrum of cerebrovascular diseases was similar in patients both with and without AIDS; however, cerebral vasculitis was observed only in the former. Thirty-nine (40%) of 97 patients with AIDS had significant cardiac disease, and cerebral emboli were demonstrated in four of the 13 patients with stroke. Stroke must be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurological disease in patients with AIDS, although it does not appear to be more common in this group than in a control population of young adults with other terminal illnesses. The causes of stroke occurring with AIDS are diverse and include cerebral emboli secondary to cardiac disease, cerebral hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia, and cerebral vasculitis.
