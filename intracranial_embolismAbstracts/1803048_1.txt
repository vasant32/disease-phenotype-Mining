The patient, a 51-year-old man, was receiving immunosuppressants for 2 yr after renal allotransplantation. He had heart failure with aortic regurgitation, fever, anemia and a history of odontectomy on admission. He was resistant to medical treatments and died from cerebral emboli. On autopsy, vegetation of the aortic valve was identified. Progression of atherosclerosis, which may have been due to steroids and chronic rejection, was prominent. This report is the first case of infective endocarditis following organ transplantation in Japan. Such complications as infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis will be on the rise with the increase of numbers or organ transplantations.
