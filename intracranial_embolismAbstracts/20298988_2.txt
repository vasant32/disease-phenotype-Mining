 OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of carotid artery stenting (CAS) with proximal cerebral protection in patients showing string sign at carotid angiography. BACKGROUND: Presence of string sign is a well-known factor for adverse events in patients with severe carotid artery disease undergoing CAS. METHODS: We used retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients who underwent carotid angiography with the intention to undergo carotid stenting and had angiographically documented string sign in the target lesion. RESULTS: From October 2006 to August 2007, 25 patients (21 men and 4 women, mean age 70.9 +/- 8.7 years) presented with string sign during carotid angiography. This was 6.0% of a total of 416 patients studied during the time of the study. Twenty patients (80.0%) were symptomatic, and 5 (20.0%) were asymptomatic. Carotid artery stenting was performed successively in all patients. Proximal cerebral protection was applied in all but 1 patient. The 30-day death/stroke rate was 0%. At 12-month follow-up neurological events did not occur; 1 patient developed a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and another patient died from noncardiac cause. The 12-month death/stroke rate was 4.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid stenting under proximal cerebral protection seems to be a feasible and safe procedure to manage patients with severe carotid stenosis in presence of angiographic string sign. Further prospective trials are required to prove efficacy of CAS in larger study populations.
