 BACKGROUND: Hydrogen peroxide is widely used for its antiseptic properties. In certain circumstances, however the risk of air embolism can create a life-threatening situation. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old adolescent required surgical treatment for femorotibial trauma. During the surgical procedure, cardiac arrest suddenly occurred when hydrogen peroxide was being used to irrigate the wound. A central catheter was inserted and aspiration of air bubbles in the line led to the diagnosis of air embolism. Outcome was unfavorable despite successful resuscitation. A chronic neurovegatative state ensued and the patient died 8 months later. DISCUSSION: Several cases of air embolism have been described due to hydrogen peroxide in surgical, medical and accidental circumstances. Our case emphasizes the potential danger of using hydrogen peroxide in certain situations, including orthopedic surgery. Clinicians should be aware that hydrogen peroxide is not a perfectly safe product.
