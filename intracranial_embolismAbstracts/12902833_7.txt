Thrombolytic stroke therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is limited by serious risks of intracerebral hemorrhage. In this study, the authors show that a novel antiactin-targeted immunoliposome significantly reduced tPA-induced hemorrhage in an established rat model of embolic focal stroke. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to focal ischemia using homologous blood clot emboli. Delayed administration of tPA (10 mg/kg, 6 hours after ischemia) induced intracerebral hemorrhage at 24 hours. In control rats treated with tPA plus vehicle, hemorrhage volumes were 9.0 +/- 2.4 uL (n = 7). In rats treated with tPA plus antiactin immunoliposomes, hemorrhage volumes were significantly reduced to 4.8 +/- 2.7 uL (n = 8, P < 0.05). No significant effects were seen when rats were treated with tPA plus a nontargeted liposome (7.8 +/- 2.1 uL, n = 9). Fluorescent immunohistochemistry showed that rhodamine-labeled targeted liposomes colocalized with vascular structures in ischemic brain that stained positive for endothelial barrier antigen, a marker of cerebral endothelial cells. These data suggest that immunoliposomes may ameliorate vascular membrane damage and reduce hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolytic therapy in cerebral ischemia.
