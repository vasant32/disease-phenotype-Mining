We report a case in which growth of a totally thrombosed giant aneurysm of the posterior cranial fossa was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) scans repeated after 4 years. A magnetic resonance (MR) image demonstrated an onion-skin-like, laminated structure within a calcified wall. The laminated structure had developed around an old thrombosis, without any communication to the flowing blood. It showed intensities indicating recent clots, revealing that the giant aneurysm had grown by recurrent intramural hemorrhage rather than by intraluminal accumulation of thrombotic materials. This case illustrates that totally thrombosed giant aneurysms still have the potential of growth.
