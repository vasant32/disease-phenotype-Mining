The safety limit of retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) in aortic arch reconstruction was evaluated in comparison with long (> or = 60 min: group A = 28 cases) and short (< 60 min: group B = 88 cases) RCP time (RCPT). RCPT was 60-94 min in group A and 24-59 min in group B. Hospital mortality was 7.1% and 6.8% in group A and B, respectively. There was no case who was died due to cerebral insufficiency. Postoperative neurological complication was observed 3 in group A and 3 in group B. There was no significance between 2 groups. There were no significant differences in the time to awake, ICU stay, electroencephalogram, and cognitive functions between 2 groups. Based on these results, the safety limit of RCP is over than 60 min and, maybe, about 90 min. We monitored the increase of deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) during RCP using a near infrared spectroscopy (n = 55). Since HbR increased gradually during RCP, HbR reflects oxygen metabolism non-invasively in the brain. HbR can be one of useful indexes of the brain protection during RCP.
