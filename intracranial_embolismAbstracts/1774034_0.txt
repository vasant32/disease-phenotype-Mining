So far, few papers on alteration of thixotropic properties of blood from patients with cerebrovascular disease have been found. We measured the thixotropic parameters of blood from 92 patients suffering from cerebrovascular diseases. These patients were divided into five groups. Group I consisted of 14 male patients with cerebral arteriosclerosis (CA) (aged 61.7 +/- 8.2 years) and Group II, 12 male patients with transient cerebral ischemic attack (TIA) (64.4 +/- 7.8 years). All of patients in groups III (22 male old patients, 66.6 +/- 5.1 years), IV (24 male middle-aged patients 53.7 +/- 2.8 years), and V (20 female patients 58.4 +/- 13.8 years) were suffering from cerebral thrombosis. These 92 patients and 92 selected healthy subjects were pair matched in sex and age. Using paired t-test, we compared their thixotropic parameters. The results showed that the yield stress (tau 0), the equilibrium value of the structural parameter (A), the apparent viscosity at 2.37 s-1 (eta s), and non-Newtonian contribution of viscosity (eta s-mu) in groups I, II and III were significantly higher than those in the corresponding control groups. The values of tau 0, A, eta s, (eta s-mu) and eta p of blood in group V were higher than those in the control group; only the values of tau 0, eta p, (eta s-mu) of blood in group IV were higher than those in the control group. No significant difference in the thixotropic parameters was noted among groups I, II and III. The results suggest that the patients with cerebrovascular diseases had evidently increased number and degree of RBC aggregation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
