In a 16-month-old boy completely thrombosed aneurysm in the midline region (Regio pinealis) was successfully extirpated. The clinical symptoms were reduced by a pressure hydrocephalus, which was caused by an occlusion of the passage of the cerebrospinal fluid at the level of the aquaeductus. In the histological picture the inner third of the wall of the aneurysm was imposing as a necrosis with a membrane-like layer of elastin-like proteins on the outward side and adjacent loose connective tissue.
