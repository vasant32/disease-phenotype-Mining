A patient harboring a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) underwent angiography in an attempt to embolize the AVM. During catheterization (and prior to embolization) he became hemiplegic and aphasic. Angiography revealed a complete middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion by an embolus. The patient was treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), a thrombolytic agent. Restoration of MCA flow was achieved, and the patient recovered. Immediately after MCA embolus, t-PA infusion may lead to thrombolysis and neurological recovery. The decision-making process as well as the risks associated with the use of t-PA are discussed.
