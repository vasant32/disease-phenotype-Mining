(WB X C57BL/6)F1-W/WV mice possess a genetic defect in multipotential hematopoietic stem cells; the mice are anemic and lack mast cells. The authors injected diluted India ink intravenously into W/WV mice and congenic normal +/+ mice and searched for genetically determined differences in the development of complications of the injection. In both W/WV and +/+ mice, intravenous ink resulted in thrombocytopenia and markedly prolonged bleeding times, as well as prolonged partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times and reduced fibrinogen concentrations. These effects were similar in W/WV and +/+ mice, although the reduction in platelet counts was greater in W/WV mice. In addition, the mortality associated with ink injection was significantly higher in W/WV mice than in congenic +/+ mice. Most W/WV mice which died first exhibited paralysis, and examination under the dissection microscope revealed that ink injection resulted in significantly more cerebral thromboemboli in W/WV mice than in +/+ controls. Bone marrow transplantation from +/+ mice corrected both the mast cell deficiency and the anemia of W/WV mice and protected the W/WV recipients from the adverse consequences of ink injection. By contrast, +/+ mice rendered as anemic as W/WV mice by breeding did not exhibit increased morbidity and mortality after ink injection. (WC X C57BL/6)F1-Sl/Sld mice, which are anemic and lack mast cells because of a genetic defect different from that of W/WV mice, also exhibited increased morbidity and mortality after intravenous ink. Finally, mixture of ink with commercial heparin prior to intravenous injection markedly reduced the incidence of cerebral thromboembolism and death in W/WV mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased morbidity and mortality exhibited by W/WV and Sl/Sld mice that received injected ink might be related to their mast cell deficiency rather than to their anemia. But measurement of the histamine content of the blood and various tissues of WBB6F1-+/+ mice injected with ink, and examination of their tissues in 1-mu sections, indicated that intravenous ink did not cause substantial mast cell degranulation. As a result, the possibility that mast cells protect +/+ mice from the adverse effects of intravenous ink by a mechanism other than degranulation and release of heparin, or that the differences in the response of W/WV or Sl/Sld mice and their +/+ littermates are due to defects other than their lack of mast cells, cannot be excluded.
