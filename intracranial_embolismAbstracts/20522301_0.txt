Since both vasculitis syndromes and infective endocarditis may present with multi-system involvement, they can pose a diagnostic dilemma. A 10-year-old boy was admitted with multi-system disease secondary to embolic complications of infective endocarditis. Echocardiography demonstrated mitral valve prolapse and moderate mitral regurgitation with vegetations on the anterior and posterior mitral leaflet. Despite supportive treatment, his general condition deteriorated and he died 3 days after admission.
