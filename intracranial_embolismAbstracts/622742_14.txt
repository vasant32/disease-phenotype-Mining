The etiologic and prognostic features which characterize cerebrovascular disease in the later decades of life are not applicable in younger patients. The records of 58 patients who had suffered cerebral infarction between the ages of 15 and 40 were reviewed in order to study these features. Fifty-five percent of the patients were found to have had an identifiable etiology for their cerebral infarction, with nearly half of these suffering from embolic infarction of cardiac origin. In 45% no clear etiology could be established but hypertension was prevalent in those patients between 31 and 40 years of age. Follow up data were obtained on 68% of the hospital survivors; nearly 3/4 of them had completely recovered or had improved.
