Papillary fibroelastomas are rare, benign cardiac tumours that most commonly arise from cardiac valves, and often present with signs and symptoms of embolization. A patient presented initially with transient ischemic attacks. He was found to have a papillary fibroelastoma on his tricuspid valve, which was successfully resected. Nine years later, he presented again with cerebral embolic symptoms and was found to have a new fibroelastoma on his mitral valve. The presence of a new lesion should be considered if signs or symptoms recur.
