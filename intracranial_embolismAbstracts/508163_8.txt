A 23-year-old woman with Eisenmenger's complex had a cerebral air embolism with resultant severe neurologic impairment while undergoing phlebotomy for secondary polycythemia. She was treated with hyperbaric therapy 29 hours after the original accident with almost complete recovery of neurologic function.
