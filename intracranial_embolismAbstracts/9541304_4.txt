Aseptic cortical venous thrombosis is rare without concomitant dural sinus thrombosis. Ulcerative colitis is associated with both dural sinus thrombosis and isolated cortical venous thrombosis. We describe a 26-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis who had a spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. An overlying thrombosed cortical vein was identified on spin-echo MR images and confirmed with angiography. Signal characteristics of thrombosed cortical veins are similar to those described in dural sinus thrombosis.
