The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, clinical significance, and embolic potential of thoracic aortic plaque in patients with cerebral ischemia and to further study the correlation of aortic plaque with carotid or heart disease. We used transesophageal echography (TEE) to evaluate potential source of emboli in aortic arch and heart, and duplex in carotid artery. A atherosclerotic lesion of aortic arch was defined as normal (0), mild plaque (1), moderate plaque (2) and protruding plaque or mobile plaque (3). 75 of 100 patients were found to have atherosclerotic lesion in aortic arch. 16 of 75 patients over degree 2 exhibited no pathologic finding of heart or carotid and 4 of 16 patients were classified as degree 3. The pathologic findings of heart and carotid were significantly correlated with aortic plaque. Age, diabetes, CAD were also significantly correlated with aortic plaque. Aortic atherosclerosis was common in cerebral ischemia. Aortic plaque might be responsible for not only some unexplained embolic events, but also for some of the embolic stroke in patient who have carotid artery or heart disease. Age, diabetes, CAD might be important risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic lesion in the aortic arch.
