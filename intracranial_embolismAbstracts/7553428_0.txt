Three patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) were imaged with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Initial spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) demonstrated acute or subacute thrombosis in all patients. The presence of thrombosis was confirmed with MRA. Repeat MRA in the three patients revealed partial recanalization in one and almost complete recanalization in two patients. The etiology of CVT is reviewed, and the advantages of MRA are compared with conventional MR imaging and computed tomography in the evaluation of CVT.
