Cardiogenic cerebral embolism is believed to be responsible over 25% of all ischemic strokes. Since 1856, Lambl's description of small excrescences on the aortic valves has attracted widespread attention and controversy. With the increasing use of transesophageal echocardiography, ever-increasing valvular strands are being detected. The case is presented of a cardioembolic stroke secondary to Lambl's excrescences in a 59-year-old man. In addition, the current concepts regarding the importance of recognizing these valvular strands are discussed, and a brief review of the topic is provided.
