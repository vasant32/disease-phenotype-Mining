Intraoperative digital subtraction angiography using commercially available equipment was employed to confirm the precision of the surgical result in 105 procedures for intracranial aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVM's). Transfemoral selective arterial catheterization was performed in most of these cases. A radiolucent operating table was used in all cases, and a radiolucent head-holder in most. In five of the 57 aneurysm procedures, clip repositioning was required after intraoperative angiography demonstrated an inadequate result. In five of the 48 AVM procedures, intraoperative angiography demonstrated residual AVM nidus which was then located and resected. In two cases intraoperative angiography failed to identify residual filling of an aneurysm which was seen later on postoperative angiography, and in one case the intraoperative study failed to demonstrate a tiny residual fragment of AVM which was seen on conventional postoperative angiography. Two complications resulted from intraoperative angiography: one patient developed aphasia from cerebral embolization and one patient developed leg ischemia from femoral artery thrombosis. This technique appears to be of particular value in the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms and vascular malformations.
