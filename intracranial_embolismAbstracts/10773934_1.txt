Antiphospholipid syndrome is an uncommon cause of stroke. A 12 year old girl with this syndrome is reported who presented with thrombotic stroke and high titres of anticardiolipin (aCL) and lupus anticoagulant (LAC). The patient improved subsequently and was put on aspirin. The present report highlights the importance of screening for aCL and LAC in cases of stroke in young patients.
