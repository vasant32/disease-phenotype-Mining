During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) microemboli lodge in the brain and other organs. Microemboli were counted in tissue samples of skin, muscle and brain from autopsy cases that had recently undergone CPB, and in skin and muscle biopsies obtained from patients before and after CPB. Unlike the brain, skin and muscle showed few microemboli.
