This report is based on a retrospective analysis of clinical and angiographic findings in 14 children and adolescents suffering from cerebral infarction. They were all examined during the acute stage and selective angiography was performed within a day or two of the stroke. Pathogenesis is discussed and focuses particularly on the occurrence of segmental arteritis from unknown (infectious?) aetiology.
