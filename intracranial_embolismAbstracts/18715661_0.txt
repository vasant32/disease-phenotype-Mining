We present the case of a 50-year old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and without any antithrombotic therapy, who was admitted to the neurologic department of our hospital with symptoms of cerebral ischemia. Two hours after the release of the neurological syndrome, she experienced an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) of the inferior wall, which was not thrombolysed due to active menstruation. The coronary angiography was performed nine days later and it showed normal coronary arteries. This is the first case report of a TIA and an acute myocardial infarction due to atrial emboli, in a middle aged woman without any coronary lesions. In our opinion it points out the strength and the effectiveness of the internal fibrinolytic mechanisms.
