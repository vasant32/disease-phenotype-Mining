The trends in age adjusted and age and sex specific mortality rates for the period 1968-1980 are compared for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. For both sexes and at all ages over 45 the mortality rates for cerebrovascular disease have fallen significantly. However, the mortality rates for ischaemic heart disease are rising significantly for males aged 55-64 and females aged 45-64. The divergence in trend is particularly noticeable for females aged 45-64. Possible hypotheses are discussed explaining this divergence in trend between two cardiovascular diseases of assumed similar aetiology.
