Migraine with aura has been shown to be an independent risk factor for stroke. Although the precise mechanism of migraine-related stroke is not known, risk factors for hypercoagulability have been found in migraineurs. Prothrombin factor 1.2 (F1.2) is a cleavage product of prothrombin. Elevated plasma F1.2 has been shown to be a sensitive and a specific marker of ongoing thrombin generation, and thus may serve as an indicator of hypercoagulability. In this study we determined plasma F1.2 levels in 35 patients with migraine (22 with aura and 13 without aura) and in 24 healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers. Elevated F1.2 levels were found in 11 of 22 (50%) patients with migraine with aura (1.25-3.5 nmol/l). None of the patients with migraine without aura nor any of the healthy volunteers had elevated plasma F1.2 levels (normal < 1.1 nmol/l). We conclude that prothrombin F1.2 levels are elevated in a significant number of patients with migraine with aura but not in patients with migraine without aura. This finding suggests that there is activation of the clotting system in certain patients with migraine with aura.
