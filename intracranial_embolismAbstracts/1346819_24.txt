Antiphospholipid antibodies have been suggested as markers for a high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in young survivors of an acute myocardial infarction. However, there are few data to confirm or refute this hypothesis. In a cohort study, we have measured anticephalin (aCEPHA) and anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies in a group of patients surviving an acute infarct. Of 597 patients studied, 13.2% were IgG or IgM aCEPHA positive compared with 4.4% of a reference population (n = 158; p = 0.002). In a multivariate analysis, adjusted for major cardiovascular risk factors, neither aCEPHA (IgG or IgM) nor a CL (IgG or IgM) was an independent risk factor for mortality, reinfarction, or non-haemorrhagic stroke. Although an increased proportion of survivors of a myocardial infarction have antiphospholipid antibodies, the presence of such antibodies is not a risk factor for subsequent coronary or cerebrovascular thrombosis.
