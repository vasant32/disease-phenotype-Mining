The authors present a seventy-two-year-old woman complaining of diffuse and firm goiter. At the first visit, she looked almost euthyroid with regular pulse rate of 78 per minute. After iodine restriction, however, she became severely thyrotoxic and developed cerebral embolism associated with atrial fibrillation due to Graves' hyperthyroidism. In conclusion, sudden withdrawal of dietary iodine might lead to exacerbation of Graves' hyperthyroidism resulting in serious cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications, especially in elderly patients.
