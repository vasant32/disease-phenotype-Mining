The therapeutic effect and laboratory finding in the treatment of 288 cases of ischemic cerebrovascular disease with PSS were analysed. Positive therapeutic response to PSS in this series of cases was obtained in 92.0% and 62.2% of the treated cases showed excellent results. Effects in the treated patients were better than in the controls. The laboratory findings showed that PSS had obvious anticoagulant effect and decreased blood viscosity and serum contents of lipids. The results of animal experiments showed that PSS had the action of blood dilution, lowering blood viscosity and ameliorating hypercoagulation. PSS was considered to be a prospective, useful drug to prevent and treat ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
