Atrial septal aneurysms have been recognized as sources of arterial embolism. An intraatrial aneurysm was demonstrated in the fossa ovalis of a 45-year-old woman who suffered an episode of cerebral embolism. The disorder is rarely treated surgically. Most patients with this condition are given life-long anticoagulation, a treatment that may have serious complications. As an alternative treatment with possible lower risk, we removed the aneurysm surgically.
