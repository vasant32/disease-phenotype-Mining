The treatment of a patient who had iatrogenic basilar artery thrombosis after endovascular occlusion of a recently ruptured wide-necked basilar apex aneurysm with a nondetachable silicone balloon is described. The rationale for the choice of a nondetachable balloon, the need for anticoagulation in the postoperative period, the timing of thrombolysis, and the choice of thrombolytic agents are discussed.
