To examine the association between anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and epilepsy, we investigated the serum titers of aCL antibodies in a total 252 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients recruited in a prospective study. Twenty-one cases with epilepsy which were not attributable to any causes other than SLE were identified after being followed-up for five years. The clinical manifestations were recorded and blood samples were tested for the presence of aCL antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes). Among 21 patients with epilepsy, 12 (57.1%), 2 (9.5%) and 2 (9.5%), respectively, had elevated baseline serum levels of IgG, IgM and IgA aCL antibodies. There was a dose-response relationship between risk of seizure and the baseline serum level of aCL antibodies (P < 0.01). The odds ratio of developing seizure were 3.7 for those who had a high level of aCL antibodies compared with those without a detectable level of aCL antibodies as the referent. Our results indicate that epilepsy as a primary neuropsychiatric event among lupus patients is associated with a high titer of aCL antibodies.
