PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency of ischemia after transbrachial digital subtraction angiography under ambulant conditions using diffusion-weighted imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 200 patients were included in a prospective study design and received transbrachial digital subtraction angiography under ambulant conditions. Before and after digital subtraction angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain was performed. RESULTS: In our study population no new lesions were found in diffusion-weighted imaging after digital subtraction angiography during the 3-hour window after angiography. One new lesion was found 3 days after angiography as a late onset complication. Therefore, the frequency of neurological complications is at the level of the confidence interval of 0 - 1.5 %. CONCLUSION: The transbrachial approach under ambulant conditions is a safe method for digital subtraction angiography resulting in a low rate of ischemic lesions in diffusion-weighted imaging.
