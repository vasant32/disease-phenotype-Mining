In a 50-year-old female patient who had suffered from coronary heart disease for about 3 years, a cerebral embolus resulted in left-sided hemiparesis. Four days later she became anuric. Acute thromboembolis occlusion of the renal arteries was assumed and renal angiography was performed. The angiography showed complete obstruction of the left renal artery and partial obstruction of the right renal artery. Due to the poor general condition of the patient it was not possible to carry out renovascular surgery or streptokinasetherapy. An attempt was therefore made to remove the emboli from the renal arteries by a new technique (transfemoral embolus aspiration). The subsequent angiography showed normal circulation in the right kidney and improved circulation in the left kidney. Ten days of dialysis treatment were required until urine production started again. Death then occurred from other causes. The autopsy confirmed free permeable renal vessels and absence of permanent sequelae in the parenchyma.
