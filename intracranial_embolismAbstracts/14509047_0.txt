Stressing live events can lead to serious deficits of emotional and social function and decrease in vitality. Depressive mood, anxiety and a considerable reduction in the mastering of daily live activities are symptoms of these disorders. Social medical and economical consequences can be reduced by early diagnosis of left performance and psychotherapeutic interventions. The example of a 41 year old man with adjustment disorder after an embolic brain injury shows how diagnosis of performance, and special psychotherapeutic treatment allowed the reintegration on the labour market.
