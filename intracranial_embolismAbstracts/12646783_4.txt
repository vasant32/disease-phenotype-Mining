BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that previous infection may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke mainly in young and middle-aged patients. The present study sought to further investigate the association between recent inflammatory events (IE) and ischemic stroke without age restriction and to determine the role of recent IE in different ischemic stroke subtypes. METHODS: We performed a case-control study with 93 consecutive hospitalized stroke patients and 200 (107 hospital and 93 community) controls. Acute IE, both infective and non-infective, occurring in the previous 30 days were assessed using a standard questionnaire. The TOAST criteria were used for ischemic stroke subtypes classification. RESULTS: Acute IE in the previous 30 and 7 days were significantly and independently associated with ischemic stroke (37/93 vs. 47/200; OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.26-3.96 and 17/93 vs.16/200; OR 2.45, 95% IC 1.11-5.39, respectively). Stratifying for stroke subtypes, acute IE significantly and independently increased the risk of atherothrombotic (OR 5.72, 95% CI 2.14-15.25) and cardioembolic stroke (OR 3.02, 95%CI 1.20-7.63). CONCLUSIONS: Acute IE increase the risk of acute ischemic stroke of atherothrombotic and cardioembolic type independently of other predisposing factors. Implications for daily clinical practice, in relation to prevention and treatment of IE in patients at risk, have to be explored.
