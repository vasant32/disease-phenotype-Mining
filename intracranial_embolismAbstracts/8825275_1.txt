INTRODUCTION: Transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) allows imaging of basal cerebral arteries as well as brain parenchyma. It may therefore serve to monitor thrombolysis in acute stroke. CASE DESCRIPTION: rt-PA thrombolysis was performed in a patient, suffering from paradoxical embolism causing MCA occlusion. Hemorrhage immediately after completion of rt-PA infusion as well as delayed MCA recanalization could be monitored by TCCS. CONCLUSION: TCCS is useful to improve monitoring and safety of systemic thrombolytic treatment.
