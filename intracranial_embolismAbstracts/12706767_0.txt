We report a case of thrombosis of superior sagittal and cavernous sinuses treated by direct instillation of fibrinolytic agents via selective catheterization. Despite risk of bleeding related to the pathology and treatment, no adverse side-effect occurred. This report is unusual regarding the poor initial clinical patient's condition with dilated and unreactive pupil. The good neurologic outcome warrants aggressive treatment in the most severe forms of cerebral venous thrombosis.
