We report here a case of special paradoxical brain embolism in a 40-year-old woman with neurological events who was diagnosed with medulla oblongata infarction. Contrast-enhanced pulmonary CT discovered that the patient had a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF). The PAVF was later surgically resected. We conclude that if a patent foramen ovale cannot be confirmed by echocardiography, contrast-enhanced pulmonary CT scan could prove to be a helpful tool to detect another origin of a right-to-left shunt such as pulmonary arteriovenous fistula.
