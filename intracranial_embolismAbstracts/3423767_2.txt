The majority of ischemic cerebral insults are caused by thromboembolism. In animal experiments we have investigated the possibility of reperfusing ischemically damaged brain tissue by thrombolysis of cerebral emboli. 1, 3 and 5 hours after cerebral infarction due to thromboembolism, thrombolytic treatment with urokinase (1000 IU/kg/min) was started. Thrombolysis, monitored by angiography, was successful in all cases (n = 15). In all cases the fall in fibrinogen, alpha 2-antiplasmin and plasminogen reflected systemic fibrinolytic effects. Anatomo-pathologic investigation of the brains revealed no intracerebral bleeding complications. The results of the study suggest a favourable effect of urokinase on acute ischemic cerebral infarction.
