The significant risk of cerebral embolism during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) makes monitoring of embolic events advisable already when developing new operation and coagulation management strategies for example in CPB animal models. The present study therefore evaluated in a porcine CPB model the feasibility of bilateral epicarotid Doppler signal recording and the quality of manual or automatic emboli detection. A total of 42 recordings (e.g. right carotid artery (n = 20), left carotid artery (n = 22)) were evaluated. The frequency of emboli counts was comparable for both carotid arteries. Automatic emboli detection, however, found significantly more embolic events per pig than did post-hoc manual off-line analysis of the recordings (172 +/- 217 vs. 13 +/-10). None of the brains, however, showed any emboli or infarction area either in cross-examination or in histological evaluation. In conclusion, the present study showed the feasibility of using an epicarotid Doppler device for bilateral emboli detection in a porcine CPB model. Automatic on-line emboli detection, however, reported more embolic events than did post hoc, off-line manual analysis. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.
