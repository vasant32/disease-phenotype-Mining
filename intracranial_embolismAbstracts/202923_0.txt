In November 1976, a 52 year old woman presented with a Moschowitz syndrome with clinical manifestations of continuous fever at 39 degrees and a transient Wernicke type aphasia. Laboratory findings included schizocytosis, a peripheral thrombocytopaenia and functional renal insufficiency. The ethanol tests was positive but there was no frank defibrination syndrome. After corticosteroid therapy failed, the patient was treated with Dipyridamole 400 mg/24 hours IV and acetylsalicylic acid 4 g/24 hours IV. Fever disappeared on the same day and the thrombocytopaenia was corrected in 48 hours. The patient was considered to be cured 15 days later. No precise aetiology to explain the Moschowitz syndrome was discovered apart from the recent ingestion of oestrogens. The authors emphasise the considerable progress which this use of a combination of Dipyridamole and aspirin represents, resulting in the cure of Moschowitz syndrome, a condition considered to be fatal up until a few years ago.
