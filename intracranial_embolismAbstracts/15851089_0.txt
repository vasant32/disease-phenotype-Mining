Chondrosarcoma is a malignant disease of cartilage. Systemic embolisation usually arises from cancerous invasion of pulmonary vessels or the left atrium but cerebral embolisation or ischaemia is rarely recognised. We report a man with left leg amputation for tibial myxoid chondrosarcoma who suffered multiple cerebral embolisms one year later. Cerebral angiography and aortogram did not reveal luminal stenosis and a cardiac survey was normal. Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time were detected. A molecular mimicry between prothrombin and paracrine hormones may have accounted for his LAC. A procoagulant autoantibody reacting against metastatic cancer cells may contribute to cancerous thrombosis, such as in chondrosarcoma.
