Two children with bone marrow necrosis at diagnosis or at relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had thrombotic complications 15 and 17 days after starting remission induction therapy including prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase. The close temporal relationship of these two relatively rare events suggests that bone marrow necrosis is a predisposing factor to the development of thrombosis.
