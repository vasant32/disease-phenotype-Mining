Computerized tomography (CT) scanning accurately identifies neurologic abnormalities in many elderly patients, often making it possible to differentiate symptomatic neurologic changes of normal aging from treatable pathologic states such as occult masses and cerebral infarction producing much the same symptoms. The scan also singles out patients in whom further diagnostic measures are necessary. The advantages of CT--low morbidity, noninvasiveness, and high sensitivity--far outweigh its limitations. Concomitant cerebral atrophy and metabolic imbalance do not significantly affect diagnostic accuracy. Risks are minimal, related chiefly to contrast allergy, and occasionally to anesthetics for patients who cannot remain motionless during the procedure.
