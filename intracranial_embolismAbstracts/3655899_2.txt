A patient with known internal carotid artery occlusion developed transient ischemic attacks in the distribution of the occluded vessel. Arteriography demonstrated a thrombus clearly originating from the internal carotid artery stump, which was unassociated with significantly stenotic atherosclerotic disease of the ipsilateral common or external carotid arteries. Stump angioplasty and endarterectomy led to complete and sustained cessation of further symptoms.
