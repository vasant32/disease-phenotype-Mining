Hyperbaric oxygenation was used in two patients with extensive neurologic damage from cerebral air embolism occurring during open-heart surgery. One patient made a full recovery. The use of hyperbaric oxygenation produces the most direct relief of the mechanical obstruction and provides the definitive treatment for cerebral air embolism. First consideration must be given to the prevention of this complication, but once an embolus has occurred, hyperbaric treatment should be instituted promptly and early. Therefore every team engaged in open-heart operations should be familiar with the diagnosis and the therapy of air embolism.
