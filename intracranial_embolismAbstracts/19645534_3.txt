OBJECT: The efficacy and pitfalls of endovascular recanalization were evaluated in cases of internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion in the subacute to chronic stage. METHODS: Fourteen cases (15 lesions) of symptomatic ICA occlusion with hemodynamic compromise or recurrent symptoms were treated at the subacute to chronic stage using an endovascular technique. The Parodi embolic protection system was used during the recanalization procedure to prevent embolic stroke by reversing the flow from the distal ICA to the common carotid artery. RESULTS: Recanalization of the occluded ICA was possible in 14 of 15 lesions. The occlusion points were 10 cervical ICAs and 4 petrous/cavernous ICAs in successfully recanalized cases. Ischemic symptoms disappeared completely after the treatment, and new ischemic symptoms did not appear related to the treated lesion. Single photon emission computed tomography findings demonstrated the improvement of hemodynamic compromise in all cases. One case showed right middle cerebral artery branch occlusion during the procedure, but this patient's neurological symptoms were stable due to preexisting hemiparesis. Endovascular recanalization was possible and effective in improving hemodynamic compromise. However, there are still several problems with this technique, such as hyperperfusion syndrome after recanalization, cerebral embolism during treatment, durability after treatment, and identification of the occlusion point before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular recanalization using an embolic protection device can be considered as an alternative treatment for symptomatic ICA occlusion with hemodynamic compromise or refractoriness to antiplatelet therapy, even in the subacute to chronic stage of the illness.
