Cerebral vasospasm has been implicated as the major pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for the cerebral ischemia and infarction that sometimes follows the rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Two cases are reported in which aneurysms of the internal carotid arteries were the source of emboli resulting in infarctions. Embolic phenomena should be considered as a possible cause of the morbidity associated with intracranial aneurysms.
