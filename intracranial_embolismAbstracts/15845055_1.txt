Spontaneous calcific cerebral embolus is a rare complication of calcific vascular disease such as calcified aortic plaques, and calcific aortic and mitral stenosis. Fewer than 10 case reports are described in the literature. Cerebral ischaemic symptoms may provide the indication for surgical replacement, even in the absence of valvular insufficiency or stenotic symptoms. We report a case of stroke in a young man with a known bicuspid calcific aortic valve.
