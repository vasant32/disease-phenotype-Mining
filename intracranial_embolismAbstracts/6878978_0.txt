The clinical story and the results of radiological and angiocardiographic investigations in 2 patients with proven mitral valve prolapse and cerebral ischemia are reported. Significant risk factors for stroke other than mitral valve prolapse were lacking. Cerebral angiography showed in one case a distal occlusion suggesting embolic brain lesion and was normal in the other case. This report suggests: 1) that mitral valve prolapse is a real risk factor for stroke in young people; 2) that two-dimensional echocardiography or angiocardiography are valuable investigations in young patients with cerebral ischemia, when clinical or electrocardiographical findings of cardiopathy are present.
