In the study of cardiac abnormalities responsible for the development of cerebral embolism two-dimensional echocardiography was performed on 350 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The results were compared with those obtained from 350 controls without any history of stroke. Atrial fibrillation was detected on ECG in 115 cases (33%) of the patients and in 35 cases (10%) of the controls (p less than 0.001). The structural cardiac diseases observed in stroke patients were: rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in 37, congestive cardiomyopathy (CCM) in 7, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 19, mitral annulus calcification (MAC) in 29, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in 9, and myocardial infarction (MyI) in 10 patients. Controls were found to have these lesions in 11, 2, 3, 12, 4 and 9 patients respectively. RHD (p less than 0.001), HCM (p less than 0.01) and MAC (p less than 0.01) were significantly more frequent in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, but not MyI, CCM or MVP. Intracardiac thrombi were diagnosed in 29 cases of patients and in 4 cases of controls (p less than 0.001). Our data suggested that nonrheumatic heart diseases such as MAC and HCM could also be considered as causes of embolic stroke. The reasons for the variable frequencies of cardiac abnormalities reported in the literature for stroke patients are discussed.
