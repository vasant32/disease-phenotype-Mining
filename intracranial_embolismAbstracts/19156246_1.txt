An air embolism in the arterial system is a rare but serious sequela of lung biopsy. We describe the case of a patient who presented with acute cardiac and cerebral air embolism, including simultaneous acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, unresponsiveness, seizure, and stroke. Computed tomographic imaging revealed air pockets in the right coronary artery and aorta. The patient made a full recovery after aggressive medical treatment and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
