Stroke is the most common neurologic disorder of adults and one of the three leading causes of death in North America. Results of a study suggest that inexpensive and easily obtained clinical variables can be used to predict which patients with stroke will do well and which will not. This capability is invaluable to physicians, patients with stroke and their families, and future investigators.
