Summary: Thirty-two patients with intracranial aneurysm were treated via the endovascular approach and clinical results and complications were accessed. The aneurysms were on the anterior circulation, posterior circulation and feeding artery of AVM in 17, 12 and three patients respectively. In 17 (anterior circulation aneurysm), 12 patients underwent parent artery occlusion. There were two complications: cerebral embolism due to premature detachment of balloons and cerebral infarct due to parent artery occlusion. In 12 (posterior circuration aneurysm), four patients had complications: three infarcts due to parent artery occlusion and one aneurysmal bleeding at the interventional procedure. Coil compactions occurred in four cases. There were no complications in cases associated with AVM. Use of detachable balloons for intra-aneurysmal occlusion and intra-aneurysmal embolisation for partially thrombosed giant aneurysm tends to result in ischemic lesions where patient outcome is poor. We must pay attention to avoid these complications even though intra-aneurysmal embolisation using microcoils is currently performed safely.
