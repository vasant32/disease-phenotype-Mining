We report a case of massive intracerebral air embolism after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a patient with a fatal head injury. There was no pneumothorax or extravascular pneumocephalus, however, air was found in the internal carotid artery. Massive cerebral air embolism may occur after entrance of air into the circulatory system via ruptured pulmonary vessels during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
