 BACKGROUND: Unstable carotid plaques cause cerebral emboli. Leptin promotes atherosclerosis and vessel wall remodeling. We hypothesized that carotid atherosclerotic lesion instability is associated with local leptin synthesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid endarterectomy plaques from symptomatic (n=40) and asymptomatic patients with progressive stenosis (n=38) were analyzed for local expression of leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. All lesions exhibited advanced atherosclerosis inclusive of thick- and thin-cap fibroatheromas or lesion rupture. Symptomatic lesions exhibited more plaque ruptures and macrophage infiltration (P=0.001 and P=0.05, respectively). Symptomatic plaques showed preferential leptin, TNF-α, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 transcript (P=0.03, P=0.04, and P=0.05, respectively). Leptin mRNA and antigen in macrophages and smooth muscle cells were confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Plasma leptin levels were not significantly different between groups (P=1.0), whereas TNF-α was significantly increased in symptomatic patients (P=0.006). Human aortic smooth muscle cell culture stimulated by TNF-α, lipopolysaccharide, or lipoteichoic acid revealed 6-, 6.7-, and 6-fold increased secreted leptin antigen, respectively, at 72 hours (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Neurologically symptomatic patients overexpress leptin mRNA and synthesize leptin protein in carotid plaque macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Local leptin induction, presumably by TNF-α, could exert paracrine or autocrine effects, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of lesion instability.
