An 62 years old patient suffering of polycythemia was treated by phlebotomy. To accelerate the blood flow the collecting apparatus was connected to a pump supplying suction. Of the two pump outlets, providing suction and pressure, the one supplying pressurized air was connected erroneously. Air was insufflated into the arm vein causing cardiac arrest. Reanimation was unsuccessful. The findings are discussed, as well as the difficulties in interpretation.
