We report a case of thyroid cardiomyopathy from an iodine overload in a patient admitted for a cerebrovascular accident. The diagnosis was suggested by a hyperkinetic circulatory status and confirmed by the increased circulating thyroid hormone concentrations. Treatment improved the haemodynamic status, however the patient died from a cerebral herniation.
