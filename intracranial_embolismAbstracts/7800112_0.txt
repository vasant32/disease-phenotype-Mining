About 17% of all transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and ischemic strokes were due to cardiogenic embolism in three prospective stroke registries (Berlin, Giessen, Klosterneuburg). Most of these patients can be identified by history, clinical examination, conventional ECG, and appropriate use of echocardiography. Widespread screening of stroke patients with transesophageal echocardiography, as intented in the protocol of two registries, did not appreciably increase the portion of patients with the final diagnosis of cardiogenic embolism, although, in many cases, minor-risk embolic sources can be identified. Prognosis for death or early recurrence after cardiogenic brain embolism was not worse than assumed previously.
