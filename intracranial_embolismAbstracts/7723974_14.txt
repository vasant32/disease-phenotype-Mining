The neuroanatomic substrate of the alien hand syndrome has remained controversial due to the noncircumscribed nature of cerebral injuries present in most cases. There have been few cases studied in which damage was restricted to portions of the body of the callosum, and most of those involved surgical callosotomy for tumors or epilepsy. We report the case of a woman with a transient alien hand syndrome caused by a stroke limited to the middle and posterior portions of the body of the corpus callosum. This case provides supportive evidence for damage to the midbody of the corpus callosum as the anatomic basis of nondominant alien hand syndrome and conforms to a model of interhemispheric motor disconnection as the essential component of this unusual behavioral syndrome. This disconnection can occur with injuries involving interhemispheric premotor and motor fibers traveling in the midportion of the callosum in individuals with left hemisphere dominance for motor activities.
