BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to describe the clinical outcome and results obtained in the endovascular therapy of ruptured cerebral aneurysms in the elderly over an 8-year period. We compared endovascular therapy results in patients aged > or =65 and <65 years. METHODS: During 1993-1999, 52 patients aged 65 to 85 years (mean age, 71.5+/-4.7 years) were embolized with the use of Guglielmi detachable coils (group I). During the same period, 143 patients aged <65 years (mean age, 47+/-11 years) with ruptured cerebral aneurysm were treated with the same technique (group II). A clinical assessment was made on admission with the Hunt and Hess (HH) classification and again in the 12th month with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), with arteriographic control in months 3 and 12. RESULTS: In group I, clinical grades on admission were as follows: HH 1, 9.5%; HH 2, 33%; HH 3, 21%; HH 4, 34.5%; HH 5, 2%. Outcome was favorable in 48% of patients (GOS 1 or 2); the mortality rate was 23%. No rebleeding was observed. Patients presenting lesions > or =10 mm had an unfavorable outcome in >77% of cases. Thromboembolic complications were present in 13% of cases. In group II, clinical grades on admission were as follows: HH 1, 14.5%; HH 2, 47%; HH 3, 11%; HH 4, 24%; HH 5, 3.5%. Favorable outcome (GOS 1 or 2) was observed in 77% of cases, with 14% mortality. Complications due to the endovascular procedure were present in 4.2% of cases. Patients with HH grades 1 or 2 on admission showed a positive outcome (GOS 1 or 2) in 77% of cases in group I and in 88.5% of cases in group II. Mortality was 9% in the first subgroup compared with 2.8% in the second. Patients who had a high clinical grade on admission (HH 4 or 5) showed a favorable outcome (GOS 1 or 2) in 16% of cases in group I compared with 41% in group II. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms in patients aged > or =65 years appears to be effective against rebleeding and represents an alternative to surgery. However, perioperative thromboembolic complications are more frequent in the elderly population.
