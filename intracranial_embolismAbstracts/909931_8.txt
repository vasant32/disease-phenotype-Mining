The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), intial slope index (ISI), transfer time (th) and volume (rCBV) were measured simultaneously in 43 hospital patients using a 133Xe intravenous injection method and quantitative dynamic 99Tcm brain scintigraphy. The measurements were made with a gamma camera and the data processing interfaced with a small digital computer. The following mean values and standard deviations were obtained from 50 control hemispheres standardized to the age of 40 years: (formular): see article. Good agreement was found between the blood flow values determined from the intra-arterial and intravenous injection techniques.
