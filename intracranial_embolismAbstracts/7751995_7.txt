We describe three cases of cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) in girls with systemic lupus erythematosus. Severe, persistent, unremitting headache was a common manifestation. In the first patient, although the clinical features were suggestive of CVT, the diagnosis was delayed and she had a significant cerebral infarct. In the other two patients the diagnosis was made earlier and led to more rapid treatment; the institution of early therapy may have prevented further sequelae. The CVT was diagnosed in all patients with a combination of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies without the need for angiography. All patients were treated for their underlying systemic lupus erythematosus and with anticoagulation. All are receiving long-term low doses of warfarin and have not had any recurrences.
