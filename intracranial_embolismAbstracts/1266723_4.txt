Aterial thromboembolic complications were studied in 253 patients who had a single aortic Starr-Edwards ball valve implanted. During the first postoperative month, six patients died from myocardial infarction, one was reoperated because of leakage caused by thrombus on the valve, and five others suffered six thromboembolic episodes. Forty-six late thromboembolic complications occurred in 40 of the 216 patients who survived the postoperative period. Seven died, four from cerebral emboli and three from myocardial infarction. The late incidence was 7 episodes per 100 patients per year. Valves of series 1200 carried a significantly higher risk of arterial thromboembolism than did those of series 2300, and most episodes occurred in patients with cell controlled anticoagulant treatment. The incidence was not influenced by time since operation, continuous arrhythmia, concomitant mitral valve disease, heart size, or the degree of intravascular hemolysis. It is concluded that arterial thromboembolic complications represent a major threat to patients with aortic ball valves even several years after operation and in spite of intense anticoagulant therapy.
