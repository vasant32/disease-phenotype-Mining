Between October 1985 and March 1988, 16 patients received the Jarvik-7 total artificial heart as an interim device before transplantation. Ten patients were afflicted with cardiomyopathy, and 6 had end-stage ischemic disease. All but 1 were men; the mean age was 47 years (range, 27 to 59 years). Thirteen patients developed cardiogenic shock despite the use of intravenous inotropic agents (mean, 23 days; range, two to 83 days) and the intraaortic balloon pump (mean, 13 days; range, two to 65 days). Three other patients became candidates because of failed transplantation. The 100-mL Jarvik-7 device was used in the first 3 patients; all subsequent recipients were treated with the 70-mL Jarvik-7. Postoperative anticoagulation was designed to keep the partial thromboplastin time between 2 and 2.5 times control. The control values were obtained during administration of heparin and dipyridamole. In all cases the function of the total artificial heart was adequate to support the needs of the recipient, and there were no mechanical difficulties with the device or the drive system. The average time of implantation was 9 days (range, one to 35 days). Two patients died before transplantation, 1 with sepsis from fungus and the other with hemorrhage from a torn pulmonary arterial anastomosis. Fourteen patients received cardiac allografts, and 7 continue to survive without restrictions. Infection within the mediastinum caused the death of 4 patients after transplantation; in 3 of these mediastinitis was not recognized before transplantation but occurred within the first 2 weeks after transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
