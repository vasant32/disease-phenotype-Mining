BACKGROUND: Surgical resection remains the optimal therapy for cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that are not suitable for liver transplantation (LT). Recently, various innovative techniques for liver resection have been developed. AIM: The aim of the study was to compare radiofrequency-assisted parenchyma transection (RF-PT) with the traditional clamp-crushing (CC) technique to explore the preferred therapy in cirrhotic patients with HCC. METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2010, 75 cirrhotic patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy were randomized to RF-PT (group 1, n = 38) or CC-PT (group 2, n = 37) groups. The primary endpoint was intraoperative blood loss. The secondary endpoints included hepatic transection time, total operating time, postoperative morbidity, mortality, length of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and liver function. RESULTS: The characteristics of the two patient groups were closely matched. The Pringle maneuver was not used in RF-PT patients. The blood loss of the RF-PT group, total or during transection, was significantly lower than that of the CC-PT group (385 vs. 545 ml, p = 0.001; 105 vs. 260 ml, p = 0.000, respectively). Compared with CC-PT patients, the morbidity of the RF-PT group was lower though not statistically significant (28.9 vs. 38.8 %, p = 0.197). One death occurred in the RF-PT group 12 days postoperative due to a large area cerebral embolism. CONCLUSION: RF-PT is a safe and feasible surgical resection method for patients with cirrhosis and concomitant HCC. In addition, RF-PT results in lower blood loss and lower morbidity than the CC technique during liver resection.
