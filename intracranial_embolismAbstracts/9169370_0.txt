A case of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma to the heart is described. The patient presented with neurological symptoms consistent with an embolic cerebrovascular accident. Evaluation by the referring cardiologist at that time showed what appeared to be a left atrial myxoma. In a review of the English language medical literature, no other case of this nature was found.
