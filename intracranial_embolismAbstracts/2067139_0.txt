The present study was designed to elucidate pathophysiological changes in the brain energy metabolism after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by administering microspheres into the right carotid canal, and the time course of changes in cerebral energy metabolism was examined up to the 7th day after the operation. Approximately 50% of the operated rats revealed typical symptoms of stroke. In the right hemisphere, cerebral ATP and creatine phosphate of the rat on the 1st to 7th day were greatly reduced by the microsphere-induced cerebral embolism (maximally 52 and 61%, respectively), whereas the tissue lactate level was increased on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day after the embolism (maximally 125%), suggesting an induction of microsphere-induced cerebral ischemia. These changes in the tissue metabolites were accompanied by a decrease in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation measured in the presence of succinate. A similar trend in the changes of biochemical markers was observed in the left hemisphere, but to a lesser degree or to an insignificant degree. The pathophysiological alterations in behavior and cerebral metabolism of microsphere-injected rats tended to return toward the normal levels on the 7th day after the operation. The results provided information on a useful model for therapeutic studies of anti-ischemic agents in the brain.
