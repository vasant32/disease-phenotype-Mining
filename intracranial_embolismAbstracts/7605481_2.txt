BACKGROUND: The description of the epidemiologic profile and analysis of the mortality of infectious endocarditis (IE) observed from 1984-1993. METHODS: One hundred thirty episodes of IE in a native valve (30 in drug addicts [IVDA] and 20 cases of nosocomial acquisition) were analyzed with right/left/bilateral localization (42/84/4, respectively), infection of the mitral/aortic/tricuspid valve (52/47/34, respectively) and the etiology was determined as Staphylococcus aureus in 52 cases, 41 Streptococcus, 13 negative coagulase Staphylococcus, and 11 Enterococcus. High risk IE were identified by uni and multivariate analysis (MVA). RESULTS: The incidence of IE ranged from 0.36 and 0.70 cases x 1.000 admitted adults/year (mean: 0.50). Transthoracic echocardiography detected bacterial vegetations in 67% of the cases with the validity to predict the development of embolisms being 55%. MVA showed the embolic episodes (present in 45% of the IE) to be associated with the IVDA patients and prolonged fever. The latter complication, being defined as > or = 10 days of fever under appropriate treatment, was observed in 32% of the cases and was due to mild (n = 15) and severe causes (n = 27). Postembolic septic complications were associated to fever with MVA. Twenty three patients died (18%), 2 IVDA and 5 nosocomial IE, mainly due to heart failure (n = 13). The independent risk factor predictors for death (p < 0.05) were: age > or = 60 years (mortality 34%), cerebral embolisms (55%), severe heart failure (37%), and the exclusion of the patient as a candidate for surgery (73%). To the contrary, right IE (mortality 0%) and cardiac surgery (5%) favoured survival. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the prognosis of infectious endocarditis in high risk patients more opportune cardiac surgery accepting greater risks should be performed.
