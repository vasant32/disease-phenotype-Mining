Malposition of a cardiac pacemaker lead within the left ventricle represents a source of early and late thromboembolic complications. We report a case of cerebral embolism, caused by an inadvertently misplaced left ventricular electrode, occurring 3 years after implantation. The lead was removed via a transaortic approach with extracorporeal circulation.
