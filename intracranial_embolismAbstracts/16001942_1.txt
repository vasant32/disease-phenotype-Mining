The incidence of mitral prosthetic valve thrombosis is low and generally dependent on low levels of anticoagulation. The clinical presentation is highly variable and ranges from asymptomatic patient though to arterial embolism or hemodynamic symptoms of valve obstruction. We report a case of a patient with presyncope and prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction with intermittent flow obstruction.
