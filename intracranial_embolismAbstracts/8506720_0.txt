Paradoxical emboli are assumed to be one cause for cerebral strokes of unknown etiology. These emboli usually cross from the right to the left heart via a patent foramen ovale. We describe the transvenous catheter occlusion as an alternative to surgical closure. There were no complications. The echocardiographic follow-up of 12 and 14 months demonstrated complete closure of the foramen ovale without recurrence of neurologic symptoms.
