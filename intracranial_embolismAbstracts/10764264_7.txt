OBJECTIVE: To determine the protective effects of various periprocedural interventions in the prevention of cerebral ischemia as a complication of endovascular carotid sacrifice (ECS). METHODS: Thirty-two cases of ECS performed at our institution, between October 1987 and July 1998, were reviewed. Fifteen patients underwent superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery. In 21 patients, the carotid artery was occluded proximal to the target lesion; and in 11 patients, a lesion trapping procedure was performed. Six patients were prophylactically anticoagulated, 14 received antiplatelet agents prophylactically, and 12 received no pharmacoprophylaxis. RESULTS: Among the six patients who were anticoagulated, there were no embolic events. Embolic events affected 4 of 14 patients receiving prophylactic antiplatelet agents, 2 of 12 patients receiving no pharmacoprophylaxis, 1 of 11 patients who underwent a trapping procedure, and 5 of 21 patients whose carotid artery was occluded proximal to the target lesion. Postocclusion cerebral ischemia developed in 7 of 15 patients who underwent bypass surgery, and in 1 of the remaining 17. CONCLUSION: Superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass did not protect against postocclusion cerebral ischemia after ECS in this series (P = 0.01). Although the small number of patients studied precludes statistical validity (P = 0.29), the trends suggest that antiplatelet agents provide no protection against postocclusion cerebral emboli after ECS. Prophylactic anticoagulation (P = 0.32) and lesion trapping (P = 0.12) may reduce the frequency of postocclusion embolic events after ECS; however, because of the small number of patients, statistical significance could not be demonstrated.
