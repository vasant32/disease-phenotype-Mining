The changing angiographic appearance of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) illustrated hemodynamic changes that can occur following subarachnoid hemorrhage and antifibrinolytic therapy. Decreased size of this lesion suggested thrombosis of the AVM. This appearance actually represented a transient, vasospastic phenomenon which reversed with time. Although the AVM underwent significant changes acutely, little changed in the long term.
