PURPOSE: To report intermediate results of a pilot study in which the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist abciximab was given to patients during percutaneous carotid stenting for recurrent internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. The objective was to prevent procedure-related cerebral embolic events and decrease the incidence of recurrent stenosis. METHODS: Sixteen patients (9 women; mean age 66.5 years, range 39-78) with severe ICA recurrent stenosis (>80%) underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting. Before the procedure, abciximab was administered intravenously as a bolus (0.25 mg/kg) followed by a 12-hour continuous infusion (10 microg/min). RESULTS: Fifteen patients received stents (14 Wallstent and 1 Strecker); 1 vessel was dilated with only 50% improvement in luminal diameter. Two stented arteries had residual stenosis (<30%) but satisfactory luminal diameter was achieved in the remaining 13 (81%) arteries. There were no neurological ischemic events during or following the procedure, nor were there any bleeding or peripheral vascular complications. Duplex surveillance studies up to 12 months revealed no significant recurrent stenosis in the treated vessels. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of abciximab in conjunction with percutaneous revascularization procedures for postsurgical carotid artery stenosis may reduce cerebral ischemic episodes. It may also attenuate restenosis in the treated artery.
