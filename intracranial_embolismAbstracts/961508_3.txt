The canine middle cerebral has been embolized using the method of Molinari. Microsurgical embolectomies were done at two hours and six hours post-embolism. Animals done at two hours remained virtually intact neurologically, and hence fared better than control dogs whose embolus remained in place. Animals done six hours post embolism had increased neurologic morbidity and mortality as compared to the controls. Pathologic study revealed hemorrhagic infarctions in 50% of the animals done six hours post embolism.
