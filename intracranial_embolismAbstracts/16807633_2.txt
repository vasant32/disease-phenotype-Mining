Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is the result of incomplete myocardial morphogenesis, leading to persistence of the embryonic myocardium. The condition is recognised by an excessively prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses of the left ventricle. These intertrabecular recesses are prone to thrombus formation, with resultant embolic sequelae. We describe a case of cerebral thrombo-embolism in a young woman due to isolated left ventricular non-compaction.
