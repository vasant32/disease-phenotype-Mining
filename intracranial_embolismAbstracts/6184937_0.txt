Two cases of crossed aphasia in dextrals are presented. Twenty six cases of crossed aphasia in dextrals are reviewed, and compared with a group of aphasics by left-sided lesions. This analysis is made attending to the clinical typology of aphasia, sex, age, associated higher cortical functions defects and familial left-handedness. Crossed aphasia in dextrals is due to right or bilateral language representation. It is concluded that anomalous language is accompanied by lesser intrahemispheric specialization of the classic areas of language. The dominance of the minor hemisphere for some praxic and visuo-spatial functions is also lessened. Crossed aphasia and familial left handedness would not be associated.
