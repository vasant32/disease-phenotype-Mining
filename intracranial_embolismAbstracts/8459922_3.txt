Dural arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the posterior cranial fossa are relatively infrequent. Intradural haemorrhage is one of their specific complications. Angiographic demonstration of varices or aneurysmal structures is one of the hallmarks of severe cases. We report a patient with posterior cranial fossa dural AVM associated with a varix mimicking a thrombosed aneurysm on CT and MRI. Internal carotid and vertebral angiography failed to demonstrate an aneurysm, but external carotid injection revealed a dural AVM affecting the sigmoid sinus, and a varix. The AVM was completely eliminated by embolization. When a dural AVM is suspected clinically selective angiography should be performed to confirm the diagnosis even when CT or MRI do not show dilated vessels.
