There is experimental evidence for recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF)-induced stimulation of hemostaseologic parameters including platelets. Using the closure time of the in vitro bleeding test (IVBT, Thrombostat 4000, VDG, Seeon) and different hemostaseologic parameters, our results are suggestive of a directly or indirectly induced in vivo stimulation of platelets following rhG-CSF stimulation in healthy stem cell donors. According to the negative transcranial Doppler microembolic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery, there is no evidence for clinically silent cerebral microembolism supporting a prothrombotic state facilitating the formation of arterial thrombi with subsequent cerebral embolization.
