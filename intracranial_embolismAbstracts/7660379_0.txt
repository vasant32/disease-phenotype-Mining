A 20 year-old Turkish patient presented with superior sagittal and lateral sinus thrombosis. The frequency of cerebral venous thrombosis generally is underestimated and may be the first clinical manifestation. In case of intracranial hypertension, cerebral venous thrombosis and Behcet's disease should be taken into consideration, especially in the high risk population from Eastern Mediterranean countries and Japan. CT with enhancement and MRI study with T1- and T2- weighted images were used to detect the thrombosed veins and to evaluate the thrombosis. Treatment with anticoagulation and corticosteroid therapy in cerebral venous thrombosis is well established today. Clinical course and prognosis in cerebral venous thrombosis are generally benign if adequate management is started in time.
