PURPOSE: To investigate the pressure gradient and degree of flow reduction associated with embolus protection filters for carotid stenting in an in vitro experiment. METHODS: Three filter devices with a perforated membrane design and one wire mesh type filter were tested. At a pressure of 70 mmHg, the flow reduction and pressure gradient were measured in a 5-mm tube using blood-mimicking fluid. RESULTS: The pressure gradient in the wire mesh filter was 1.65+/-0.49 mmHg (95% CI 1.32 to 1.86). The mean pressure gradient in the perforated membrane filters was 6.88+/-2.62 mmHg (95% CI 6.22 to 7.55, p<0.0001). There was also a significant correlation between pressure gradient and flow reduction (r=-0.77, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Embolic protection filters cause a pressure gradient and obstruct blood flow. This effect is marked in perforated membrane filters and almost absent in the wire mesh filter.
