BACKGROUND: Hypothermic circulatory arrest is a valuable adjunct for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Retrograde aortic perfusion through the femoral artery, however, carries a risk of cerebral embolism or malperfusion. To avoid these complications we adopted antegrade aortic perfusion through a prosthetic graft attached to the left subclavian artery through a left thoracotomy. METHODS: Ten patients had repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm under deep hypothermia with antegrade aortic perfusion through the left subclavian artery. Hypothermic circulatory arrest was used because proximal aortic control was hazardous due to rupture or intraluminal disease, or for spinal cord protection. RESULTS: There was no brain injury and one hospital death. The cause of death was massive bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract not related to deep hypothermia or the perfusion method. All 9 survivors were alive and well after a mean follow-up period of 9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Using the left subclavian artery as a site of aortic perfusion can avoid retrograde aortic perfusion, hence reducing the potential for brain injury due to embolic stroke or malperfusion through a dissected thoracoabdominal aorta.
