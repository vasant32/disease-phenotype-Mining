The results of a comparative clinical study with pentoxifylline -- a new vasoactive compound -- and xanthinol nicotinate in fifty-eight patients suffering from cerebral thrombosis with hemiplegia or monoplegia, are presented. Pentoxifylline appeared to be more effective in reducing motor deficit and was significantly better in improving the patients' intelligence and memory score. Recovery from speech deficit was equally well seen with both drugs.
