A rare case of aseptic thrombosis of the right vein of Labb√© in a young woman is reported. Cerebral venous thrombosis was suggested by computed tomography and confirmed by angiography. Mild left-sided neurological deficits resolved almost completely. The combination of a nonspecific clinical picture with an atypical lesion on CT may favour the diagnosis of cortical venous thrombosis.
