A 28-year-old man with a history of rheumatic heart disease, alcoholism and amphetamine abuse presented with severe left upper quadrant abdominal pain and persistent fever. He stayed at home for the previous two months due to intermittent dull lower abdominal pain, chills, fever and tarry stools without seeking medical help. A diagnosis of infective endocarditis with splenic infarcts and a renal infarct was made based on the echocardiographic and abdominal computer tomography scan findings. His clinical course was complicated by an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction and cerebral hemorrhage. Despite aggressive medical treatment, his condition deteriorated. One month later, his condition became more critical with pneumonia and intractable shock, and his family requested his discharge. He died soon after leaving the hospital.
