Complications encountered during 351 selective coronary artery and coronary artery bypass examinations performed by the Judkins technique are reviewed. The over-all incidence of cardiac and peripheral vascular complications was 3.13 per cent. The cardiac complications included four ventricular fibrillations and one acute myocardial infarction. Peripheral vascular complications included three femoral artery thromboses, two peripheral emboli, and one probable cerebral embolus. There was one death. The incidence of cardiac complications was not significantly different from that reported in the literature with the Sones technique and local arterial complications were significantly lower than those reported with the Sones technique. The causes of individual complications are analyzed and measures to minimize these complications are described. The Judkins technique is a simple, reliable, quick, and safe method of selective coronary arteriography. The incidence of complications can be kept at an acceptably low level by stringent observation of every minor detail of the technique.
