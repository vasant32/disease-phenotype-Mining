In vascular surgery, intraoperative monitoring of the brain is recommended when the internal carotid artery (ICA) is clamped, because brain damage by ischemia and embolism is possible. Clamping of the ICA results in embolic or ischemic brain lesions in about 7 % of all patients undergoing the procedure. Prophylactic routine insertion of an intraluminal shunt can cause brain embolism and does not reduce the occurrence of complications. Consequently, a shunt should only be inserted, if critical reduction of cerebral perfusion is evident after clamping the ICA. Measurement of carotid stump pressure is an invasive method to estimate perfusion of the brain hemisphere at the clamping side. Transcranial doppler sonography (TCD) measures the mean blood flow velocity in the ACI, but practicability is suffering from technical problems in 20% of all patients. However, TCD is useful for detecting intraoperative embolism and postoperative hyperperfusion. Changes of oxyhaemoglobine and desoxyhaemoglobine concentration in brain tissue can be measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with wavelengths between 700 and 1000 nm. NIRS measurement is easily performed and reacts quickly to changes of brain tissue oxygenation, but there is still lacking evidence and at present a general recommendation of its application in vascular surgery is not justified. Use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) is the most widespread cerebral neuromonitoring during vascular surgery due to its high reliability and simple application. Sensitivity and specifity for ischemic lesions are 100% and 94%-99%, respectively. SEP are regarded as the gold standard for cerebral neuromonitoring in anaesthetized patients.
