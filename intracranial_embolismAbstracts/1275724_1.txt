The neurohistological investigation of a portion of the internal carotid artery removed in operation on the occasion of occlusion revealed afferent, cholinergic and adrenergic nerve elements randomly located in the examined area. The histochemical and electronmicroscopic investigation of the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion removed from 42 patient operated on the occasion of occlusion of the carotid artery revealed a depletion in the ganglia of synaptic active zones, focal absence of catecholamines and neurohistological materials suggests that a substantial role in the process of stenosing of vascular walls is played by sophisticated effects of innervation connections upon the vessel sheaths.
