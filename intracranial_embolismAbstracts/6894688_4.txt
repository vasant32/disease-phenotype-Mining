Human atheromatous material was separated into lipid and nonlipid fractions by ether and chloroform-methyl alcohol procedures. The maximum nonlethal doses of nonlipid, lipid, and whole (unseparated) atheromatous material were 8 mg, between 15 and 30 mg, and between 50 and 60 mg when injected into the left common carotid arteries of rabbits. In vitro production of thrombi showed that the nonlipid material produced thrombi that were larger in volume, weight, and length than those produced by whole material.
