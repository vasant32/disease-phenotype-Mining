BACKGROUND: Papillary fibroelastoma of the endocardium is a benign cardiac tumor which may cause embolic events. CASE REPORT: We report the first case, to our knowledge, of cardiac papillary fibroelastoma which was revealed by cerebral ischemic events in a patient infected by the human immunodeficiency virus. The initial diagnosis was mitral endocarditis complicated by cerebral embolic events. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates that fibroelastomas should be added to other valvular diseases described in HIV infected patients. We recall the embolic potential of cardiac papillary fibroelastomas which warrant surgical treatment.
