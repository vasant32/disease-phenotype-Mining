Cerebral mycotic or infective aneurysms are a rare complication of infectious illness, and such aneurysms of the intracavernous portion of the internal carotid artery are rare. They have been described as a consequence of cavernous sinus infection in an immunocompromised host, but not previously in a renal transplant recipient. We present such a case with serial MRI showing progression from arterial narrowing to aneurysm formation. Transcranial Doppler sonography of the middle cerebral artery showed distal asymptomatic embolisation from the aneurysm.
