OBJECTIVE: Although chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is considered a condition of the elderly, it may also occur in younger patients. The objective of this study was to identify the cause of CSDH in younger patients. METHOD: In a group of 100 consecutive patients with CSDH diagnosed in our hospital between 1 January 2000 and 31 August 2003, we found nine patients to be younger than 35. These nine were assessed to identify their cause of CSDH. RESULTS: We found a predisposing cause in five of nine patients, three having a disorder of CSF balance, and two having a clotting disorder. Trauma was reported in only two of these five patients. Among the four patients without a predisposing factor a trauma was reported in three of them. In only one patient the cause of CSDH remained unknown. All patients made a complete recovery. CONCLUSION: Chronic subdural haematoma did also occur in younger patients. Trauma, CSF imbalance, and deranged clotting increase the risk of CSDH, however this disorder can also occur in the absence of identifiable predisposing factors or trauma.
