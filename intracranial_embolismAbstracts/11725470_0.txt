The echocardiographic identification of cardiac tumors as cause of embolic episodes is infrequent, and the finding of multiple papillary fibroelastoma is even less common. We report a 70 years old female with a history of a rheumatic mitral valve lesion, subjected to a commissurotomy in 1970. She was admitted with a cerebrovascular accident and the transesophageal echocardiogram revealed the presence of a multiple papillary fibroelastoma in the aortic valve. The patient was operated and the tumor excised, the pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was discharged in good conditions and after 8 months of follow up, she has no neurological abnormality and is in functional class I.
