BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ex vivo effect of aspirin (ASA) on platelet aggregation, the platelet component of thrombosis, was studied at repeated intervals in a cohort of patients taking aspirin for recurrent ischemic stroke prevention to define the maintenance of efficacy over time. METHODS: We administered increasing doses of aspirin (from 325 to 1300 mg/d) to patients with previous ischemic stroke and determined the extent of inhibition of platelet aggregation after 2 weeks and thereafter at approximately 6-month intervals. RESULTS: Over 33 months, 306 patients had platelet aggregation studies performed to define their initial response to ASA therapy. Of these, 228 had complete and 78 had partial inhibition of platelet aggregation at initial testing. To date, 119 of those who had complete inhibition and 52 who had partial inhibition have undergone repeat testing at least once. At repeat testing 39 of the 119 (32.7%) with complete inhibition at initial testing had lost part of the antiplatelet effect of ASA and converted from complete to partial inhibition without change in ASA dosage. Of the 52 with partial inhibition at initial testing, 35 achieved complete inhibition either by ASA dosage escalation (in 325 mg/d increments) or fluctuation of response at the same dosage, but 8 of those 35 (22.8%) had reverted to partial inhibition when tested again. Overall, 8.2% of patients ultimately exhibited ASA resistance to 1300 mg/d-8 of 52 (15.4%) with partial inhibition and 6 of 119 (5.0%) with complete inhibition at initial testing. CONCLUSIONS: The antiplatelet (and presumably the antithrombotic) effect of a fixed dose of ASA is not constant over time in all individuals. The mechanisms by which increased dosage requirement or ASA resistance develops and the clinical significance of this development are currently undefined.
