BACKGROUND: To determine the cardiological substrate in acute stroke patients presenting with a cardioembolic stroke subtype. METHODS: Data of 402 consecutive patients with cardioembolic stroke (cerebral infarction, n=347; transient ischaemic attack, n=55) were collected from a prospective hospital-based stroke registry in which data on 2000 stroke patients over a 10-year period were included. In all patients, specific cardiac disorders were identified by physical examination and results of electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography. Holter monitoring and more sensitive techniques of cardiac imaging were used in selected cases. RESULTS: Cardioembolic cerebral ischaemia accounted for 20% of all acute strokes (25% of ischaemic cerebrovascular events). Cardiac sources of embolism included the following: (a) structural cardiac disorders associated with arrhythmia (n=232), the most frequent being left ventricular hypertrophic hypertensive disease (n=120) and rheumatic mitral valve disease (n=49); (b) structural cardiac disease with sustained sinus rhythm (n=81), the most frequent being systolic left ventricular dysfunction of both ischaemic (n=35) or non-ischaemic (n=24) aetiology; and (c) isolated atrial dysrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, n=88 and atrial flutter, n=1). CONCLUSIONS: Hypertrophic hypertensive cardiac disease complicated with atrial fibrillation was the most frequent cardiac source of emboli in cardioembolic stroke. Other important cardiac sources were isolated atrial fibrillation, rheumatic mitral valve disease, and systolic left ventricular dysfunction of ischaemic and non-ischaemic cause. The incidence of traditional emboligenous-prone cardiac disorders, such as mitral valve prolapse and mitral annular calcification was low.
