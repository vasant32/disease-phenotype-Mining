Encouraged by the effective prevention of arterial thromboembolism with a combination of ASA and anticoagulants (9), the present study was done in 77 patients with a single Starr-Edwards aortic ball valve. They received one gm. of ASA daily, then the dose of anticoagulants was reduced gradually and the drug discontinued on average five weeks later. Six arterial embolic episodes occurred in five patients, the incidence being 14.5 complications per 100 patients per year. Five emboli were cerebral, none of them serious, and one was removed from a femoral artery. Four of the embolic episodes occurred in three of the 11 patients with continuous arrhythmia, probably from venus thrombi that developed in the left atrium. The occurrence of only two embolic complications in the 66 patients with sinus rhythm suggests some prevention of arterial thrombus formation on the prosthetic valves. The results indicate that ASA is inferior to anticoagulants in patients with arrhythmia, while it may represent an alternative to anticoagulation in individuals with sinus rhythm. We prefer, however, the combined therapy in patients with aortic valve prostheses because of the strong anti-thrombotic effect achieved by this treatment.
