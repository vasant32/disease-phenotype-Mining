Difficulties in location of transcranial ultrasound (US) windows and blood flow in cerebral vessels, and unambiguous detection of microemboli, have limited expansion of transcranial Doppler US. We developed a new transcranial Doppler modality, power M-mode Doppler (PMD), for addressing these issues. A 2-MHz digital Doppler (Spencer Technologies TCD100M) having 33 sample gates placed with 2-mm spacing was configured to display Doppler signal power, colored red and blue for directionality, in an M-mode format. The spectrogram from a user-selected depth was displayed simultaneously. This system was then explored on healthy subjects and patients presenting with varying cerebrovascular pathology. PMD facilitated window location and alignment of the US beam to view blood flow from multiple vessels simultaneously, without sound or spectral clues. Microemboli appeared as characteristic sloping high-power tracks in the PMD image. Power M-mode Doppler is a new paradigm facilitating vessel location, diagnosis, monitoring and microembolus detection.
