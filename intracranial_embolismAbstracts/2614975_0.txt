Using positron emission tomography and 15O-steady state method, cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen consumption and oxygen extraction fraction were measured in patients with embolic occlusion and in those with thrombotic occlusion in the carotid system. By the study of patients with embolic occlusion, we evaluated ischemic threshold of CBF for infarction to be 16 ml/100 ml/min. The area of "penumbra" could be estimated in regions with CBF value just above this threshold. In the patients with thrombotic occlusive lesion, we clarified that the efficiency of the collateral circulation was mainly related to the grade of peripheral atherosclerosis. These findings must be helpful to develop better strategy for treatments of cerebral ischemic disease.
