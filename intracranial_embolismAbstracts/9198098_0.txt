We report a 79-year-old woman with basilar artery occlusion. She had a sudden onset of tetraplegia and disturbed consciousness, and within four days from the onset she showed a varied, fluctuating eye symptoms. On admission, she showed ocular bobbing, skew deviation with the right eye lower-positioned, upward gaze palsy, one-and-a-half syndrome, and paralytic pontine exotropia (PPE). On the third day after the onset, she showed wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (WEBINO) syndrome, and on the fourth day, she showed one-and-a-half syndrome again. Her right-gaze palsy improved repeatedly, and on the 19th day from the onset, only right MLF syndrome remained. Her eye symptoms fluctuated probably according to the distal migration of emboli, there by the responsible lesion and the mechanism of these eye symptoms are considered to be closely inter-correlated. On the fourth day after onset, the magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebral infarctions in bilateral middle pons, the left paramedian lower pons, and the right paramedian midbrain, and a hemorrhagic infarction in the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. We believe that that the eye symptoms of this patient were caused by lesions in the paramedian midbrain or pons.
