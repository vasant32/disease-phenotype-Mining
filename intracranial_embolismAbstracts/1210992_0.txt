Among 216 examined patients 96 demonstrated clinical symptoms which neither fitted into the classical alternating syndromes nor into the syndrome of Foit-Gilleman. It should be held in mind that the magistral vessels (vertebral arteries) and the minor vessels of the stem are involved in the pathogenesis of "nondifferentiated" "multiple level" syndromes. Their anatomo-physiological condition determines the final realization of the pathological process, its anatomical localization and extensiveness.
