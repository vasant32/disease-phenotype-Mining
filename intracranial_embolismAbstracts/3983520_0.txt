A multifocal haemorrhagic infarction of the basilar artery territory, linked to the persistence of a trigeminal artery is reported. This was associated to hypoplasia of the basilar artery and of the posterior communicating arteries. The trigeminal artery supplied most of the distal part of the basilar territory. At post mortem there was no arterial occlusion and the infarction probably resulted from embolism from the heart or from the carotid artery.
