OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC) in the descending thoracic aorta and plasma levels of hemostatic markers in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF). DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A cross-sectional study at a university hospital. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: In 91 consecutive patients (mean +/- SE age, 70 +/- 1 years; 68 men) with nonrheumatic AF who underwent transesophageal echocardiography, plasma levels of markers for platelet activity (platelet factor 4 [PF4] and beta-thromboglobulin [beta-TG]), thrombotic status (thrombin-antithrombin III complex [TAT]), and fibrinolytic status (D-dimer and plasmin-alpha(2)-plasmin inhibitor complex [PIC]) were determined. RESULTS: Forty-three patients who had aortic SEC (AoSEC) were older (72 years vs 68 years; p < 0.05) and had a higher prevalence of chronic AF (88% vs 52%; p < 0.05) than 48 patients without AoSEC. TAT, PIC, and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with AoSEC than in those without AoSEC, whereas PF4 and beta-TG levels were not different between the two groups. Although the prevalence of cerebral embolism did not differ between the two groups (23% vs 29%), the prevalence of peripheral embolism was higher in patients with AoSEC than in those without AoSEC (10% vs 0%; p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed mitral regurgitation (odds ratio, 7.53; p < 0.02), SEC in the left atrium (odds ratio, 2.14; p < 0.02), and aortic atherosclerosis (odds ratio, 1.87; p < 0.04) emerged as independent predictors of AoSEC. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with nonrheumatic AF who have AoSEC appear to have enhanced coagulation activity but not platelet activity. Intensive anticoagulation treatment might be required for these patients.
