Antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) have been reported to be associated with thrombosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in many other clinical groups. However, although these antibodies have been identified in a substantial number of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in this case an association with thrombosis has not been evident. We describe a patient with HIV infection who had anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) but no lupus anticoagulant (LA) who had recurrent transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and a mild stroke.
