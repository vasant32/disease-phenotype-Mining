AIM: To study echocardiographic parameters associated with embolic complications in patients with cardioembolic and other pathogenetic subtypes of ischemic stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 330 patients with ischemic stroke (IS) were examined. Transthoracal echocardiography was made in all the patients, transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 53 (16.1%) patients. The patients were divided into two groups: 104 (31.5%) patients who survived cardiocerebral embolism (group 1), 226 (68.5%) patients with other pathogenetic subtypes of stroke (group 2). RESULTS: Cardiac pathology was detected in 220 of 330 (66.7%) examinees with ischemic heart disease in 50.0% and 51.3% patients of group 1 and 2, respectively; infectious-inflammatory diseases--in 27.9 and 4.4%, respectively (p < 0.0001), other diseases (mitral prolapse, aneurysm and interatrial defect, idiopathic arhythmia) in 25.0 and 5.3% patients, respectively (p < 0.0001). Left atrial myxoma was diagnosed in 1.9% patients of group 1. CONCLUSION: Echocardiographic changes associated with a risk of embolic complications were visualized in all pathogenetic subtypes of ischemic stroke. In cardioembolic stroke echocardiography detected most frequently prolapse with myxomatous degeneration of the cusps and mitral vegetations, mitral failure, calcinosis of the mitral ring, local hypokinesia of the left ventricle, dilation and thrombosis of the left atrium. Rare changes, indicating cerebral embolism, include replaced aortic and mitral valves, mitral stenosis, cardiac tumor, aneurysm and defect of the interatrial septum.
