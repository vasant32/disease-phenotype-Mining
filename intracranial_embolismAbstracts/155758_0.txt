A case is presented of chronic systemic Dacron and Teflon embolism arising from a Beall Model 103 mitral valve prosthesis installed 11 years earlier. The emboli induced intense foreign body reaction resulting in numerous microgranulomas throughout the body. Multiple microinfarctions in the brain accounted for repeated episodes of transient ischemic attacks. Wearing of the prosthesis with consequent embolic complications seems to be the inevitable terminal fate of such early models of the Beall valve. Regular assessment of the functional status of such prostheses, particularly those in place for more than 5 years, is strongly recommended.
