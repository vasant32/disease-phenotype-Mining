The aim of this prospective study was to determine the etiologic factors leading to stroke in a group of young adults. We studied 95 patients aged 50 years or under who were admitted with the diagnosis of stroke over a 2-year period. These patients underwent complete clinical and laboratory assessment for stroke. The etiology was established in 73 (76.8%) out of 95 cases. Arterial hypertension, embolism and atherosclerosis were found to be the most frequent causes in patients with ischemic stroke, whereas hypertension and aneurysm rupture were the most prevailing etiologies in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Miscellaneous causes represented one fourth of all cases of the series. Coagulation abnormalities occurred in some patients, but in these cases there were also other well established causes. Paradoxical embolism was not observed. This study corroborates the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation to establish an accurate diagnosis.
