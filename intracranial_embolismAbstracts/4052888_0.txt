The role of the carotid siphon as a source of embolic material has had limited morphological or clinical study. The morphologic data available suggests that the siphon plays only a small role in embolic cerebrovascular disease. Clinical studies, however, suggest that it has a significant ischemic potential. To clarify this apparent discrepancy, we have designed a scanning electron microscope study of the carotid siphon. Eighty percent of the specimens from the carotid bifurcation and 30% of the siphon specimens showed evidence of damaged endothelium with attached red cell and platelet debris. The embolic potential of the siphon is estimated to be between 1/3 to 1/2 that of the carotid bifurcation. This supports the most recent clinical studies.
