Aleksandr Luria described several tests of higher motor function, including the "reciprocal coordination" test of bimanual coordination. Although these tests are commonly used to assess frontal lobe function, their specific neuroanatomic underpinnings are not completely understood. We describe a man with a medial frontal stroke sparing the corpus callosum with a defect in Luria's reciprocal coordination test but otherwise intact motor abilities, including other tests of higher motor function.
