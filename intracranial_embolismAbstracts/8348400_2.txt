Four Chinese patients with extensive smooth muscle tumors of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right heart are described. Two patients had primary IVC leiomyosarcomas and one had both IVC and cardiac metastases from uterine leiomyosarcoma. The remaining patient had extra-uterine intravenous leiomyomatosis, with extensive tumor calcification. Clinical presentation was variable, consisting of the Budd-Chiari syndrome, a new heart murmur, and signs of cerebral embolism. All the lesions were defined radiologically prior to surgical resection of cardiac tumors.
