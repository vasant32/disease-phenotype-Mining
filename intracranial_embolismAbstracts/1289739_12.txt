Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with flow rephased gradient-echo sequences is a new non-invasive method for vascular imaging. We compared MRA and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography in 18 patients with intracranial aneurysms to test whether MRA presently provides an alternative to cerebral angiography for the diagnosis of these anomalies. MRA showed 19 of the 22 aneurysms detected (86.4%). However, problems, especially with turbulent or slow flow, resulted in 6 studies (27.3%) with limited and 2 with questionable demonstration of an aneurysm, and 1 false negative study. At present, MRA is definitely inferior to angiography for the demonstration of intracranial aneurysms, due to its lower resolution and other limitations.
