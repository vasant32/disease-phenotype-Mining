In our studies of the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm, we have been emphasizing that microthrombosis may play an important role in the induction of cerebral ischemic symptoms or cerebral infarction. In this report, multiple microthrombi are demonstrated histologically to be a major cause of cerebral infarction in the autopsied brain of a 63-year-old woman who died from typical cerebral vasospasm that occurred after the rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. We discuss the significance of thrombus formation and subarachnoid perivascular acidosis in vasospasm.
