Cerebral embolization of an aqueous solution of propyliodone (Dionosil) occurred during selective bronchographic studies following a fiberoptic bronchoscopic procedure with transbronchial biopsy in a patient undergoing investigation of a pulmonary lesion. The embolization resulted in a grand mal seizure and transient neurologic deficits. This potential complication has not been previously reported. We suggest that selective bronchographic studies be avoided when the transbronchial biopsy is associated with endobronchial bleeding.
