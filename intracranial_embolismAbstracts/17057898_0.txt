Approximately 40% of ischemic strokes have no clearly definable etiology and are termed cryptogenic strokes. Patent foramen ovale, a small communication between the left and right atria, is considered to be a risk factor for cerebral embolism. In this study, we report the case of a 29-year-old woman with diagnosis of ischemic stroke due to patent foramen ovale who has undergone percutaneous endovascular closure. The aim of this report is to discuss the relevant aspects of the patent foramen ovale and the cryptogenic stroke, its clinical presentation, diagnosis, management and recurrence.
