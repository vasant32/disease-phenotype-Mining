We have cannulated the ascending aorta for cardiopulmonary bypass via left thoracotomy in order to avoid conventional retrograde perfusion from the femoral arteries, which is associated with an increased risk of cerebral embolism. We use silk sutures to retract the anterior margin of the opened pericardium from the chest wall, which provides good exposure and easy control of the ascending aorta. Between July 1997 and November 2000, cannulation proved easy to do and reliable in 24 serial patients.
