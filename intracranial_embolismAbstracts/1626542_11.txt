In the early 1980s, a standardized community-based stroke register was started in three geographic areas in Finland: North Karelia and Kuopio in eastern Finland and Turku/Loimaa in southwestern Finland. The results from the first 3 years, 1983-1985, confirmed the high incidence of stroke in Finland. The incidence of stroke was higher in eastern Finland than in the southwestern part of the country. The age-standardized annual incidence among men aged 25-74 years varied from 206 per 100,000 population in southwestern Finland to 322 per 100,000 population in the province of Kuopio in eastern Finland. Among women aged 25-74, incidence was 119 and 187 per 100,000 population in these two areas, respectively. The age-standardized male:female ratio in incidence was 1.7, slightly higher than that previously reported in Finland. Out of 3,574 stroke events registered, 78% were first events without a history of previous stroke. People aged 65-74 years accounted for 45% of all events among men and 62% of all events among women. The authors' experience shows that the geographic variation in stroke incidence and attack rates is difficult to assess even within a country with a relatively uniform health care system. Rigorous standardization and quality control is needed for the assessment of long-term trends; this is the primary goal of the FINMONICA Stroke Register. The findings of this study suggest that the incidence of stroke is still high in Finland, although mortality from stroke has steeply declined during the past 15-20 years. The number of stroke survivors in Finland may actually be increasing. Since the occurrence of stroke is high in Finland as compared with other countries, intensified primary and secondary prevention measures are needed to reduce it.
