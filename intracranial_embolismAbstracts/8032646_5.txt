1. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether naftidrofuryl oxalate (naftidrofuryl), a vasodilator, is capable of improving brain regional blood flow of animals in sustained ischaemia. 2. Cerebral ischaemia was induced by injecting 900 microspheres (48 microns in diameter) into the right internal carotid artery of rats. Cerebral blood flow of brain regions was measured by a hydrogen clearance method on the 3rd, 7th and 28th days after the onset of ischaemia. Ischaemic animals were treated with naftidrofuryl, 15 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p., from the first to 28th day. 3. Microsphere-embolism caused a sustained decrease in cortical and striatal blood flow over a period of 28 days, whereas hippocampal blood flow was decreased on the 3rd day but not on the 7th or 28th day. On the 3rd day, the striatal and hippocampal but not cortical blood flow of naftidrofuryl-treated, microsphere-embolized rats was higher than untreated rats. On the 7th and 28th days, the cortical and striatal blood flow of the treated and untreated animals did not differ. 4. Brain slices from microsphere-embolized rats contained areas, which were not stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), to a similar degree on the 3rd, 7th and 28th days, indicating the genesis of cerebral infarction. TTC-unstained areas of microsphere-embolized rats that had received naftidrofuryl treatment were smaller than those of untreated rats on the 3rd and 7th days, but not on the 28th day. 5. The results suggest that naftidrofuryl improves cerebral circulation impaired by microsphere-induced ischaemia and this higher level of cerebral blood flow of the treated animal may account for the delayed development of cerebral infarction.
