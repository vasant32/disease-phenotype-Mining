OBJECTIVE: To assess morbidity, mortality, sorts, risk factors, prevention and treatment of patients with cerebrovascular disease complication (CVDC) undergoing cardiopulmanary bypass (CPB). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 10,173 cases of CPB surgery, analysed risk factors of CVDC after CPB surgery in comparison with controls. RESULTS: After CPB surgery, the general morbidity of neurological complications (NC) was 1.44% (146/10,173), of which CVDC accounted for 59.58% (87/146). In the CVDC group, cerebral embolism accounted for 39.09%, cerebral infarction 28.74%, cerebral haemorrhage 11.49%, prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) with CVD 10.34%, and others 10.35%. Death occurred in 44 patients of the NC group, in which CVDC went to 47.72% (21/44). Aortic clump time and CPB time were greatly longer in the CVDC group than controls (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The main postoperative neurological complications after CPB surgery are CVDC, most of which are ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Postoperative CVDC correlates with longer aortic clump time and CPB time during the operation.
