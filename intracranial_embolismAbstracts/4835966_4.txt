A case of atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia involving the carotid artery in a 38-year-old male is described. The lesion, with associated intimal disruption and subintimal hematoma, caused cerebral embolus and transient neurologic dysfunction. Segmental resection and autogenous graft reconstruction of the carotid artery were successful in removing the lesion and preventing subsequent symptoms.
