There is some confusion regarding the indications for and methodology of the use of contrast material in cranial computed tomography. Some authors recommend a nonenhanced scan in all cases, followed by an enhanced scan if indicated by the symptoms or the appearance of the unenhanced scan. Others have questioned the value of the nonenhanced scan in patients with tumor. The authors offer a protocol for the use of contrast material. Possible tumor patients are scanned with contrast material alone; other patients are scanned either (a) without contrast material or (b) both with and without contrast material, depending upon the most likely clinical diagnosis.
