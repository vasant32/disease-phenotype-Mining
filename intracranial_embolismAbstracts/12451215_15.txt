Obesity has been shown to increase lumbar CSF pressure in healthy subjects. The authors studied lumbar CSF opening pressure in 18 obese, 33 overweight, and 49 nonoverweight subjects with normal MRI and MR venography (MRV) of the brain. No subject had a CSF pressure above 200 mm H2O. Obesity does not cause abnormal CSF pressure in subjects with normal MRV. Individuals with a CSF pressure higher than 200 mm H2O should undergo MRV to exclude cerebral venous thrombosis.
