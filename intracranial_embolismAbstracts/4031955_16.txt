In a group of 75 patients under the age of 45 years with stroke, ischaemic cerebral infarction was diagnosed in 60 patients and primary intracerebral haemorrhage in 15. Trauma was found to be the commonest identifiable predisposing factor to cerebral infarction, being present in 13 cases (22%). Migraine was the second most commonly identified predisposing factor while atheroma and hypertension were infrequent. Such a high frequency of preceding trauma has not previously been described, perhaps because it is not generally appreciated that the delay between the traumatic event and subsequent stroke may be considerable. The diagnostic management of young stroke patients is considered with particular reference to the indications for specialized cardiac and neuroradiological investigations.
