In this article, a longitudinal case study of a client (whose initials are TH) with chronic Broca's aphasia is presented. The language data encompass test and therapy data over a 7-year period, during which TH's language performance and verbal communicative behavior have improved and continue to improve. A carryover from oral to written sentence production and to verbal communication in everyday life has been observed. The long-term provision of therapy has not only lead to improved verbal communication skills, but has also enhanced his quality of life. The case study discussed in this article demonstrates the value of long-term treatment and research on the evolution of language deficits across time. This approach provides a window for examining the dynamic processes of language recovery--the quantitative and qualitative changes that can be achieved when language therapy is provided long term in the chronic phase. Long-term analysis of the manner in which language functions respond to therapeutic intervention also provides detailed basic information required for a realistic characterization of the spectrum of language deficits for each symptom complex and/or aphasia type, not only for a single test time. This will lead to a better understanding of the recovery process and to development of therapy protocols in better accordance with the deficits at a particular point in the recovery process.
