Inflammatory reactions occurring in the brain after ischemia may contribute to secondary damage. In the present study effects of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent, alone or in combination with mild hypothermia, on focal embolic brain ischemia have been examined. Focal ischemic injury was induced by embolizing a preformed clot into the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Infarct volume was measured at 48 h after the injury. Administration of minocycline alone or minocycline plus mild hypothermia reduced infarct volume significantly. However, mild hypothermia in combination with minocycline did not show any additive effect. These results suggest that minocycline is beneficial in focal ischemic brain injury, and the lack of the enhanced neuroprotection may be due to the brief exposure to hypothermia.
