The high variability in presence and signature of microembolic signals (MES), detected with transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), cannot be explained with the currently available published data. We applied customized postprocessing on the radiofrequency (RF) signal of a standard TCD system. The spatial resolution was on the order of 2 mm, depending only on the length of the ultrasound (US) burst emitted. The amplitude of clutter-filtered RF signals was color-coded and plotted as a function of time and depth (range 30 mm). Additionally, 128 point fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) (50% temporal overlap) were calculated, visualizing both the background Doppler spectrum and the MES. We evaluated 122 gaseous MES from two patients during cardiac surgery and 52 particulate MES from four patients after carotid endarterectomy. Both MES categories showed comparable properties: they appeared in the RF amplitude plot as rather straight lines of increased intensity, indicating that the velocity remained approximately the same while they passed the US beam. The velocity calculated from the amplitude plot never exceeded that of the background Doppler spectrum. Various "MES patterns" could be identified with respect to the depth range at which the MES were visible. A quarter of the gaseous MES changed their direction at a specific depth, suggesting that the MES entered a branch (e.g., an M2 artery or the anterior cerebral artery). In the FFT analysis, these MES contained both positive and negative frequencies. It is concluded that MES show consistent signature patterns in the amplitude-time plots and that the previously reported variability of MES appearance in conventional Doppler systems is an artefact caused by relatively large signal amplitudes and sample volumes.
