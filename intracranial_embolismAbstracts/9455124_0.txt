Physical activity is known to increase glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. To examine the influence of physical inactivity on insulin sensitivity in aged people, insulin sensitivity and secretion was measured by using a two-step euglycemic glucose clamp, a glucagon tolerance test (GTT), an oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) and urinary CPR excretion in 11 aged patients immobilized in bed for more than 12 weeks. The results were compared with those of nine healthy mobile aged controls. The muscle volume of the immobilized patients decreased by 20-25% compared with that of the controls, and insulin sensitivity decreased 50% in each step. These results mean that the immobilized patients had decreased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness, even when there was muscle atrophy. The glucose and insulin responses in both the GTT and OGTT showed that there was a slight decrease in the initial response of insulin in the immobilized patients and was in the controls compared with adolescent controls. There was no difference in the initial response of insulin between the immobilized patients and the aged controls. The ratio of impaired glucose tolerance in the OGTT was 4/11 of the immobilized patients and 3/9 of the controls. Total insulin secretion was increased and insulin sensitivity and responsiveness was decreased in the immobilized patients. This suggests that the decreased insulin sensitivity was compensated for increased by insulin secretion in the immobilized patients.
