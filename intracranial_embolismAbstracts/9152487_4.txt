The incidence of clinically significant thromboembolic events is reported to be as high as 25% in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). Clinically detectable neurologic deficits resulting from thromboembolic events are reported to occur at a frequency of 0.0056% per patient-month with the Thermo Cardiosystems Heartmate 1000 (Woburn, MA) intraperitoneal LVAD (TCI). To date, the occurrence of asymptomatic cerebral microemboli in patients with this device has not been characterized. Transcranial doppler (TCD) monitorings were used for evaluation of the incidence of cerebral microembolism in 14 patients with the TCI LVAD. Studies were performed after LVAD support ranging from 7 to 305 days. Overall, 35 studies were obtained from the left middle cerebral artery for a duration of 30 minutes per study and the number of high intensity transient signals (HITS) were recorded. In one patient with a fatal stroke, an average of 0.86 HITS per study period (0.03/min) was observed. In 13 patients without any symptoms, an average of 0.46 HITS per study (0.016/min) was observed. Overall, no HITS were determined in 74% of the studies. Although the clinical significance or the nature of these microemboli is unknown, the data support that microembolism with the TCI LVAD is a rare event despite absence of anticoagulation. Long-term detailed neurocognitive testing and hematologic assessment is needed to establish the clinical relevance of these microemboli in patients with detected signals.
