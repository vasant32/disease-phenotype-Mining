The aim of this prospective study was to assess the value of complementary investigations in the diagnosis and follow-up of embolic heart disease. Forty-six patients having presented a systemic embolism cardiac origin underwent a standard work up which included clinical examination, ECG, chest X-ray and 2D echocardiography. Other investigations were carried out in some patients: CT cardiac scan (11 cases), gamma scintigraphy with Indium III labelled platelets (6 cases) and angiocardiography (12 cases). The diagnosis of an embolic cardiac lesion was made after the standard investigations in 82% of cases. The remaining 18% of cases hall had echocardiographic abnormalities and enable the diagnosis of clinically imapparent conditions: mitral valve prolapse, aneurysm of the interatrial septum, valvular calcification and cardiomyopathy. A potentially embolic mass was visualised in 18 patients; 6 valvular vegetations, 12 left atrial or ventricular thrombi. The other specialised radionuclide, angiographic and CT investigations only confirmed the echocardiographic diagnosis of intravavitary thrombosis. These results were confirmed surgically in 19% of cases. This study shows that complementary investigations especially echocardiography, allow diagnosis of latent embolic cardiac lesions, some of which may benefit from surgical treatment. In addition, potentially embolic intracardiac masses may be visualised, so confirming the origin of systemic emboli. When surgery is not indicated, echocardiography is a good method of following up the results of medical treatment in some of these masses.
