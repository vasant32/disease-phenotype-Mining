This short clinical report presents a case of giant pelvic hematoma with infiltration of the abdominal wall, initially misdiagnosed as incisional hernia by means of the old McBurney laparotomy. The patient, a 56-year-old female, was under chronic coumarin anticoagulation to prevent systemic embolism recurrence (rheumatic polyvalvular disease, atrial fibrillation, and previous brain embolism). On admission, the I.N.R. was 6.6. The risks versus benefits dilemma of chronic oral anticoagulation is briefly commented.
