In 24 albino New-Zealand rabbits spasm of the basilar artery was produced by local application of autologous blood. The effects of blood and blood clot removal or topical nicardipine, each alone and in combination of both methods, were studied and compared to untreated controls. As well clot removal alone as topical application of nicardipine without clot removal resulted in some, but statistically not significant, enlargement of the spastically narrowed basilar artery. Only the combination of both methods caused a significant vasodilatation, up to almost normal diameter range.
