We report a case of paradoxical brain embolism mediated through a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). A 25-year-old right handed man was admitted to our hospital after sudden headache and visual field abnormality. In neurologic examinations, he had left superior-quadrantanopsia. Laboratory findings showed iron deficiency anemia. Diffusion weighted images disclosed a high-signal-intensity area in the right occipito-temporal lobe, and intraarterial digital subtraction cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed continuous right-to-left shunt. We confirmed his history of spontaneous recurrent epistaxis and the first-degree relatives with epistaxis or PAVM. A contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest revealed a PAVM. The diagnosis of paradoxical brain embolism mediated through the PAVM with HHT was, thus, established. The PAVM was occluded by using embolization coils successfully. In Asian countries, the prevalence of PAVM with HHT is thought to be lower than in European countries. We should carefully take medical and family histories, especially epistaxis, in a young stroke patient.
