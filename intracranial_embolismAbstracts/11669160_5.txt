OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and predictors of microemboli on transcranial Doppler (TCD) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven patients with SLE underwent TCD testing. RESULTS. Fifteen of 153 patients (9.8%) who successfully underwent TCD testing had microembolic events. Predictors of TCD microemboli included valve repair or replacement (p < 0.0001) and higher SLE Disease Activity Index (p = 0.07). Antiphospholipid antibodies and atherosclerotic plaque on carotid duplex were not associated with TCD microemboli. CONCLUSION: TCD microemboli may represent a noninvasive method to ascertain risk of stroke in SLE. TCD microemboli are not associated with traditional stroke risk factors. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if TCD microemboli are predictive of future stroke in SLE.
