12 giant intracranial aneurysms were studied by MRI. Intraluminal thrombosis was observed in 9 aneurysms. Thrombosis was found more frequently in larger aneurysms. Thrombi were formed posteriorly or inferiorly in the lumen of 4 among 5 IC-cavernous aneurysms. Location of the neck of the aneurysms and stagnation of blood flow influenced by gravity may be causative factors determining the location of thrombi. In 6 aneurysms intraluminal thrombi were inhomogeneous on MRI, suggesting that the thrombi had been formed at different times. New thrombi were formed between the aneurysmal wall and the old thrombus in 3 cases. Dissection of the aneurysmal wall by residual blood flow in the lumen or hemorrhage in the aneurysmal wall may be one of the growth mechanisms of giant intracranial aneurysms.
