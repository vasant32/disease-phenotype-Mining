A 66-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of abrupt onset of left hemiparesis and confusional state. Ten hours prior to admission, she developed difficulty in left hand movement, and her family noticed cloudiness of consciousness and gait disturbance. Neurological examination revealed only a hollow hand sign of the left hand without other neurological deficits. Cranial CT showed a low density area in the right superior parietal region, and the follow up CT on 6th hospital day exhibited contrast enhancement and hemorrhagic transformation in this area. Cerebral angiography demonstrated capillary blush and early venous filling in the right posterior parietal region. Transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography (TEE-CD) showed a shunt flow via patent foramen ovale (PFO). Thus, we diagnosed this case as paradoxical cerebral embolism through PFO, which is characterized by rapid recovery of clinical manifestation, so-called spectacular shrinking deficit. Even in elderly patients with embolic stroke of unknown origin, TEE-CD should be performed to investigate PFO.
