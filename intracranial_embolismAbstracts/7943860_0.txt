Acid-base balance and lactate concentration in the arterial blood and spinal liquor have been studied in 32 patients after air embolism of the brain vessels developed during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. It has been shown that an increase of lactate concentration in the spinal liquor over 3.5 mmol/l after air embolism of the brain vessels is indicative of severe hypoxic brain damage, in which the prospect of stable consciousness recovery is doubtful. In lactate concentration 4.5-5 mmol/l and higher as well as in metabolic acidosis of liquor (sodium hydrocarbonate concentration less than 20 mmol/l) the intensive care procedures used were not effective. It is believed that these parameters are of prognostic value in the condition under study.
