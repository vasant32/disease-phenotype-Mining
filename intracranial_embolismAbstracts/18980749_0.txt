Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are very rare and benign tumors, usually involving heart valves. They are sometimes asymptomatic. However, they become serious illnesses when associated with clinical events, as systemic embolism. Diagnosis is evoked by echocardiography and confirmed by histopathological examination. The only curative treatment consists of the excision of the tumor under cardiopulmonary bypass. This approach is safe and prevents the risk of embolism recurrence. We report the cases of two patients suffering from acute cerebral embolism. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography detected tumors of the mitral and aortic valve in the first and second patients, respectively. Preserving the valve integrity, both masses were surgically excised and pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis. As surgical management is curative, we believe that these lesions should be always removed.
