The origin of hemolytic anemia, the histogenesis of vascular changes and the origin of prethrombotic lesion are discussed in a typical case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with early neurological symptoms. The disease arose after exposure to a chloronaphtalene containing substance. In addition to the typical vascular changes of different age, early non-endothelialised and non obstructing aggregates of fibrin and thrombocytes are observed. Clusters of drop-like deformed erythrocytes and elongated leucocytes are attached to their surface. These changes do not appear to have been reported previously in TTP. The fresh thrombi are regarded as being hematologically active. Support for their supposed causal relationship to hemolytic anemia is given by experimental data by Brain and Bull.
