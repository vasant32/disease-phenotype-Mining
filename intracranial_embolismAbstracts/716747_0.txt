The following operations were performed for ischemic strokes in 116 patients: resection of a loop of the internal carotid artery on the neck, resection of the sympathetic ganglion, and the creation of anastomosis between the branch of the superficial temporal artery and the cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery. The method of the microsurgical intervention is described in detail and the indications and contraindications for various operations in ischemic strokes are discussed. Elaboration and improvement of the methods of microsurgery will make it possible to map out the prospects in the treatment of cerebral circulatory disorders.
