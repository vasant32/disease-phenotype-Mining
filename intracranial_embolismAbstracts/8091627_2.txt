The effect of a single ligature on back pressure in the internal carotid artery was studied in nine horses. In six anesthetized horses, one internal carotid artery was catheterized 2 cm from its origin and blood pressure was recorded continuously. Then the artery was ligated, pressure was recorded again, and the horses were euthanatized. In another three anesthetized horses, indwelling catheters were placed in both internal carotid arteries and a loose ligature was placed proximal to one catheter. After horses recovered from anesthesia, the ligature was tied and blood pressure was recorded in both arteries on that day and 3 days later, then these horses were euthanatized. The anatomy of the cerebral arteries was examined in all nine horses. Blood pressure in the internal carotid arteries did not change after ligation. Subjectively, collateral channels considered most likely to maintain blood pressure in the ligated internal carotid artery were the caudal intercarotid artery and the cerebral arterial circle. We concluded that ligation of the internal carotid artery would not prevent severe hemorrhage from the internal carotid artery in horses with guttural pouch mycosis until the ligated artery thrombosed to the level of the lesion.
