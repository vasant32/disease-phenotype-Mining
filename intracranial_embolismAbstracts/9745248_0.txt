A 63-year-old male presented with an embolic stroke in the right medial inferior cerebellum. Angiography at 2 and 8 months after the stroke revealed arteriovenous shunts from the vermian branch of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery of the right inferior vermian vein. The shunts mimicked the arteriovenous shunts of post-recanalization in acute ischemic stroke, but were finally diagnosed as a pre-existing congenital arteriovenous malformation based on their persistence. Arteriovenous shunts that persists more than 2 weeks after ictus should be differentiated from the post-recanalization arteriovenous shunts of ischemic stroke, as the different etiology may affect the ultimate prognosis and course of treatment.
