To increase the sensitivity of MRI parameters to detect tissue damage of ischemic stroke, an unsupervised analysis method, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA), was applied to analyze the temporal evolution of ischemic damage in a focal embolic cerebral ischemia model in rat with and without recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment. Male Wistar rats subjected to embolic stroke were investigated using a 7-T MRI system. Rats were randomized into control (n=9) and treated (n=9) groups. The treated rats received rt-PA via a femoral vein at 4 h after onset of embolic ischemia. ISODATA analysis employed parametric maps or weighted images (T1, T2, and diffusion). ISODATA results with parametric maps are superior to ISODATA with weighted images, and both of them were highly correlated with the infarction size measured from the corresponding histological section. At 24 h after embolic stroke, the average map ISODATA lesion sizes were 37.7+/-7.0 and 39.2+/-5.6 mm2 for the treated and the control group, respectively. Average histological infarction areas were 37.9+/-7.4 mm2 for treated rats and 39.4+/-6.1 mm2 for controls. The R2 values of the linear correlation between map ISODATA and histological data were 0.98 and 0.96 for treated and control rats, respectively. Both histological and map ISODATA data suggest that there is no significant difference in infarction area between non-treated and rt-PA-treated rats when treatment was administered 4 h after the onset of embolic stroke. The ISODATA lesion size analysis was also sensitive to changes of lesion size during acute and subacute stages of stroke. Our data demonstrate that the multiparameter map ISODATA approach provides a more sensitive quantitation of the ischemic lesion at all time points than image ISODATA and single MRI parametric analysis using T1, T2 or ADCw.
