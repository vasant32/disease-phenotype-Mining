Four patients with echinococcosis of the heart are presented. The diagnosis was suspected or established before operation by serology, echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. The sites affected were the right and left atria, left ventricular apex and interventricular septum. The right and left atrial cystic masses simulated atrial myxoma, with brain embolization from the latter. The cyst in the interventricular septum was discovered on routine echocardiography in a patient with disseminated hydatidosis. All patients successfully underwent excision of their cysts under temporary cardiopulmonary bypass, and are doing well up to 2 years and 8 months afterwards on medical therapy.
