The effects of microsurgical embolectomy were investigated clinicopathophysiologically in 60 dogs after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk with a silicone cylinder embolus. One group of animals served as a control (non-embolectomized group), and in the other two groups the embolus was removed 3 or 6 hours after occlusion (3-hour or 6-hour embolectomy group). In the non-embolectomized animals, major neurological deficits with deep cerebral infarction were observed. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the basal ganglia decreased most prominently. Sensory evoked potentials also declined to about 50% of the control level 3 hours after embolization. In the 3-hour embolectomy group, mild neurological deficits with minimal infarctions were found. One hour after embolectomy, CBF was restored to the original level in all regions, and the sensory evoked potentials surpassed the control level. In the 6-hour embolectomy group, most animals exhibited major neurological deficits and severe brain swelling with hemorrhagic infarction. This study suggests that early microsurgical embolectomy of the MCA trunk restores blood flow in the perforating arteries and prevents deep cerebral infarction.
