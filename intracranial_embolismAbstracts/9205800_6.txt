Central cholinergic neurons play an important role in learning and memory functions. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the pathological changes in learning function and acetylcholine metabolism of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, following microsphere embolism in rats. Microspheres (48 microns) were injected into the right internal carotid artery of the rats. Learning function was determined using a passive avoidance task on the seventh day after the embolism. In the biochemical study, acetylcholine and choline contents, and choline acetyltransferase activity were measured in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Cortical acetylcholinesterase-containing fibers were quantitatively estimated in the embolized rat. Passive avoidance was impaired in the microsphere-embolized rat. Microsphere embolism decreased the acetylcholine concentration and choline acetyltransferase activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the histochemical study, the length of cortical acetylcholinesterase-containing fibers was decreased, but cell density was unchanged in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the microsphere-embolized rat. The results suggest that microsphere embolism induces severe damage to cholinergic neurons, which may be related to the impairment of learning function in the ischemic brain.
