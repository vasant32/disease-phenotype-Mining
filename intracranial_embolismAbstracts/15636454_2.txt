We describe the case of an elderly man who was admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of an acute anterior myocardial infarction, together with an acute bioccipital ischaemic stroke. Coronary angiography revealed embolization of the distal left anterior descendens and the first septal branch. The definite diagnosis of paradoxical embolism was made by means of a transoesophageal echocardiography which demonstrated a large snake-like floating thrombus crossing a patent foramen ovale. This diagnosis was also supported by the presence of deep venous thrombosis as a probable origin of the intra-atrial thrombus and the secondary pulmonary embolism which contributed to the elevated right heart pressure.The patient was treated with full-dose heparin and subsequently oral anticoagulation. After discharge, follow-up by transoesophageal echocardiography was organized and once the intracardiac thrombus had disappeared, elective transcatheter closure of the patent foramen ovale was performed.
