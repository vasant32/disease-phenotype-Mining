The cardiogenic factors which may contribute to the stroke syndrome have been discussed (Table 14.7). Pathophysiological mechanisms include emboli from rheumatic coronary and congenital heart diseases. Atherosclerotic disease and hypertension can involve both intracranial and extracranial arteries. Disturbances in cardiac rhythm can significantly reduce cerebral blood flow. The development of cerebral hypoxia with resuscitation is described. Treatment of these disorders is reviewed, and the potential role of metabolic support of the ischemic tissue both with cerebral and myocardial damage has been presented.
