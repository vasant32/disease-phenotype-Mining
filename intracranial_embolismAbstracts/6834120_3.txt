The present study investigates the hematological reaction to arterial injury during the first 10 minutes after endarterectomy in dogs to determine if heparin reversal during this early period predisposes to thrombus formation. Known platelet physiology would predict that heparinization during this early period would be useful to allow a fibrin-free platelet monolayer to form. After systemic heparinization (145 mu/kg) of the experimental animals, 42 endarterectomies were performed. Blood flow was then resumed for specific periods of time, and the vessels were prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Group 1 vessels (from the unheparinized control group) revealed mural thrombus formation after 10 minutes of blood flow. Group 2 vessels revealed the progressive formation of a fibrin-free platelet monolayer after 2, 5, or 10 minutes of blood flow resumption under systemic heparinization. Group 3 arteries, harvested at 10 minutes, underwent immediate (within 1 to 2 minutes after resumption of flow) heparin reversal with protamine sulfate, and demonstrated numerous patches of fibrin covering the platelet monolayer. Group 4 arteries, studied after 3 hours of blood flow, also underwent immediate heparin reversal. Two of these seven specimens had clumps of fibrin overlying the platelet monolayer. The Group 5 vessels had heparin reversal at 10 minutes, and demonstrated no fibrin overlying the platelet monolayer after 3 hours of blood flow. This study demonstrates the formation of a fibrin-free platelet monolayer over the endarterectomized vessel wall within 10 minutes of resumption of flow under systemic heparinization. These findings suggest that heparin may safely be reversed following a carotid endarterectomy if one awaits the initial critical 10 minutes of blood flow.
