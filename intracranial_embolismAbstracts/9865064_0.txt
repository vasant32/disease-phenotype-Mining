We encountered an 80-year-old man with sudden bilateral visual disturbance. When he was admitted to the hospital, his blood pressure was 138/70 mmHg, and an ECG revealed atrial fibrillation. Neurological examination showed only bilateral homonymous hemianopsia with no nystagmus or impairment of eye movement. He did not have paralysis cerebellar ataxia, or speech disturbance. Therefore, there was no evidence of obstruction of the thalamogeniculate or thalamoperforating artery. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed cerebral infarctions in both occipital lobes. Perimetry showed bilateral homonymous hemianopsia; the left side of the macula was spared. The lack of neurological deficit other than bilateral homonymous hemianopsia indicates that only the right and left cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery were occluded.
