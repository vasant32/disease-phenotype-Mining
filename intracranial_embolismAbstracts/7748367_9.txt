A 14-year-old girl with sickle cell disease and nephrotic syndrome developed bone pain, followed by pulmonary edema, seizures, coma, and bilateral flaccid paralysis. Fat embolism syndrome was diagnosed by cranial magnetic resonance imaging and an exchange transfusion was performed. Within 3 months, all symptoms had resolved. It is concluded that fat embolism syndrome must be considered as a possible cause of acute neurologic deterioration in patients with sickle cell anemia.
