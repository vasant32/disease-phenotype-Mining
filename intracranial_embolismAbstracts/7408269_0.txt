Hemoptysis in mitral stenosis may occur frequently, but massive pulmonary hemorrhage is uncommon. We describe a patient with mitral stenosis who had severe hemoptysis and required anticoagulation for recurrent embolic cerebrovascular accidents. The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement with a Hancock bioprosthesis. There was no evidence of pulmonary bleeding following operation. This case illustrated that mitral valve operation may be performed in acutely ill patients for the relief of hemoptysis.
