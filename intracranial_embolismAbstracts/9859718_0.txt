We report a clinical case of a 63-year-old patient, referred with a history of repeated strokes, whose only cause was a patent foramen ovale with shunt right to left diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography. He underwent minimally invasive surgery, through right parasternal minithoracotomy, practising defect closure. We comment on the value of echocardiography for diagnosing this pathology and the utility of this surgical technique for repairing these defects.
