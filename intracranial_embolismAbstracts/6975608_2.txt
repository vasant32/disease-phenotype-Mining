When intraoperative balloon pump support is needed for patients who cannot be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and when the balloon catheter will not pass retrograde into the aorta from the femoral artery, the catheter must be inserted into the ascending aorta directly. We have found that the new Datascope "percutaneous" balloon catheter offers many advantages for direct insertion into the ascending aorta, but certain precautions are necessary to prevent cerebral emboli when the percutaneous balloon catheter is used this way.
