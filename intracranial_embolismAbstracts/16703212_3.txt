The purpose of this report is to explore angioplasty and stenting with cerebral embolic protection as a salvage procedure for a compromised carotid-subclavian bypass in the presence of antegrade vertebral artery flow. A 76-year-old woman with a carotid-subclavian bypass presented with graft infection. Failure of medical therapy to treat the infection prompted surgical removal of the graft. The native subclavian artery was still patent, but a severe complex proximal stenosis was present with antegrade flow into the left vertebral artery. Angioplasty and stenting of the subclavian artery was performed with cerebral protection achieved by positioning a FilterWire EX in the left vertebral artery via the left brachial artery approach. Deployment of a filter device in the vertebral artery via the brachial or radial approach can provide embolic protection without interfering with the subclavian artery stenting. The successful treatment of the subclavian artery enabled the complete removal of the infected graft without need for major vascular reconstruction.
