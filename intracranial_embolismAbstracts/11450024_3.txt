Low fibrinolytic activity may increase the risk of thrombosis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system. We examined the PAI-1 levels in patients with ischemic stroke. Plasma levels of PAI-1 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 55 consecutive patients (age 60.2 +/- 11.4, 40 males and 15 females) with ischemic stroke. The PAI-1 assessments as well as neurological examinations using validated stroke scales were conducted at admission and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after stroke. Sex- and age-matched controls (+/- 4 years) underwent plasma PAI-1 measurement once. Etiology of the stroke was classified using the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria. All pertinent stroke risk factors were recorded. All patients were contacted 3 years after stroke for recurrent vascular thrombotic disease. The plasma PAI-1 levels were 17.2 +/- 7.8 IU at admission, 11.2 +/- 9.2 IU at 1 week, 14.4 +/- 7.9 IU at 1 month, and 17.8 +/- 7.8 IU at 3 months among patients and 11.8 +/- 9.5 IU among controls (p values are < .002, .7, .12, and < .0005, respectively). As a rule, the neurological scores did not show a correlation to the PAI-1 levels. Presence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, anticoagulant treatment, and sleep apnea did not affect the PAI-1 levels at any time point. Females had slightly higher PAI-1 levels. Age was a strong determinant for PAI-1 levels being higher in younger patients at every sampling time point (p values .02, .02, .02, and .03 respectively). The etiology of the ischemic stroke did not have an impact on PAI-1 levels. In 16 patients recurrent thrombosis had occurred. The high PAI-1 levels at admittance may reflect either an acute phase response or a chronic state. Normalized levels at 1 week and 1 month may be due to hospital diet, antithrombotic medication, weight loss, active physical therapy, and better care for diabetes. PAI-1 levels at 3 months after stroke did not predict recurrent thrombosis.
