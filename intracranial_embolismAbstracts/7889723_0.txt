Acute stroke may cause hypertension and actually available devices for non-invasive blood pressure monitoring make it possible to study short-term variability of pressure in this condition, in order to settle a more rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach. In our experience blood pressure variability has shown to be greater in thrombo-embolic, than haemorrhagic stroke. This outcome contributes to explain literature disagreement on benefits of antihypertensive therapy and suggests the need for blood pressure monitoring in every trial, that wants to evaluate with satisfactory reliability the antihypertensive treatment in ischaemic stroke. As to antihypertensive drugs to be used in stroke patients, we prefer antiadrenergics, because hypertension in this clinical condition is due to adrenergic overactivity. Our preliminary experience with a centrally acting antiadrenergic drug (clonidine) has shown its ability not only to reduce blood pressure, but also blood pressure variability in ischaemic stroke.
