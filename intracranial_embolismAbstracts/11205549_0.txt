INTRODUCTION: Approximately 20% of all ischemic strokes are due to cardioembolism and occur more frequently in the younger patients. Our objective was to determine the clinical characteristics and course of cardioembolic infarcts (ICCE) comparing them with infarcts due to other aetiologies (ICNCE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a prospective study of 354 patients admitted to hospital over a period of one year, after excluding transient ischaemia and parenchymatous/subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two groups were established: ICCE (29.4%) and ICNCE (70.6%), comparing age, sex, risk factors and course of the illness. Subsequently a study lasing two years was done to assess the recurrence rate. RESULTS: The ICCE patients were older (75.89 compared with 72.58, p = 0.004), often know the exact time of onset of their symptoms (p = 0.015) and usually are admitted to hospital during the first six hours of their illness (p = 0.01). There was a significantly higher incidence of ischemic cardiopathy or auricular fibrillation (p = 0.0052); p = 0.005); more complications arose (p = 0.000); stay in hospital was longer (13.62 as compared to 11.8 days; p = 0.035), there was a lower weekly BI score (p = 0.0023) and higher mortality (p = 0.000). In the subgroup of 70 patients evaluated two years later 11 cases recurred, with no difference observed between the anticoagulant and anti-aggregant groups. CONCLUSION: The ICCE occurs in older patients, they develop worse neurological defects, have a worse short-term prognosis, develop more complications and have significantly greater mortality.
