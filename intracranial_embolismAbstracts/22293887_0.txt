 BACKGROUND: Significant atherosclerotic stenosis of internal carotid artery (ICA) origin is common (5-10% at ≥ 60 years). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables high-resolution (120 µm) plaque imaging, and IVUS-elucidated features of the coronary plaque were recently shown to be associated with its symptomatic rupture/thrombosis risk. Safety of the significant carotid plaque IVUS imaging in a large unselected population is unknown. MATERIAL/METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety of embolic protection device (EPD)-assisted vs. unprotected ICA-IVUS in a series of consecutive subjects with ≥ 50% ICA stenosis referred for carotid artery stenting (CAS), including 104 asymptomatic (aS) and 187 symptomatic (S) subjects (age 47-83 y, 187 men). EPD use was optional for IVUS, but mandatory for CAS. RESULTS: Evaluation was performed of 107 ICAs (36.8%) without EPD and 184 with EPD. Lesions imaged under EPD were overall more severe (peak-systolic velocity 2.97 ± 0.08 vs. 2.20 ± 0.08 m/s, end-diastolic velocity 1.0 ± 0.04 vs. 0.7 ± 0.03 m/s, stenosis severity of 85.7 ± 0.5% vs. 77.7 ± 0.6% by catheter angiography; mean ± SEM; p<0.01 for all comparisons) and more frequently S (50.0% vs. 34.6%, p=0.01). No ICA perforation or dissection, and no major stroke or death occurred. There was no IVUS-triggered cerebral embolization. In the procedures of (i) unprotected IVUS and no CAS, (ii) unprotected IVUS followed by CAS (filters - 39, flow reversal/blockade - 3), (iii) EPD-protected (filters - 135, flow reversal/blockade - 48) IVUS + CAS, TIA occurred in 1.5% vs. 4.8% vs. 2.7%, respectively, and minor stroke in 0% vs. 2.4% vs. 2.1%, respectively. EPD intolerance (on-filter ICA spasm or flow reversal/blockade intolerance) occurred in 9/225 (4.0%). IVUS increased the procedure duration by 7.27 ± 0.19 min. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid IVUS is safe and, for the less severe lesions in particular, it may not require mandatory EPD use. High-risk lesions can be safely evaluated with IVUS under flow reversal/blockade.
