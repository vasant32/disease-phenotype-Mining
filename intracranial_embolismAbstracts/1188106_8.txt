Thirty-seven cranial computed tomography (CCT) scans of proved or highly probable recent ischemic brain infarcts were analyzed visually and numerically, with results organized by infarct age. The lesions typically appeared as homogeneous low density abnormalities, with no significant difference in scan characteristics between infarct age groups, i.e., it was not possible to determine the age of an infarct by its noninfused, CCT appearance alone. Eight infarcts showed "mass effect," and 4 of the 20 contrast-infused cases demonstrated marked density augmentation of "blush," indicating that infarcts may resemble tumor in both of these properties.
