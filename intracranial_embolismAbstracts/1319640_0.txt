Clinical and hemodynamic studies were carried out in 75 patients with stem brain infarction in the acute period, including repeated infarctions. The total rupture of the autoregulatory mechanisms of the brain blood flow was discovered, leading to the development of different phenomena of "brain steal" determining the clinical course of stem brain infarction. In the given pathology, the acute period is characterized by the development of the vicious circle of hemodynamic disorders, which is coupled with pathological dissociation in coagulation hemostasis. The progression of the hemodynamic changes requires pathogenetic correction of central and cerebral circulation.
