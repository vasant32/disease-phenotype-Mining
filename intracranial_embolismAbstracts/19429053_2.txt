We have previously reported that peripheral administration of GPE prevents neuronal injury after ischemic reperfusion injury in young adult rats. This study examined the ameliorating effects of GPE-treatment after embolic injury induced by microsphere injection in young adult and aged male rats. Unilateral injury was induced by injecting microspheres into the right internal carotid artery in both young adult (3-4 months) and aged (16-17 months) male rats. Either GPE (12mg/kg) or the vehicle was infused intravenously over 1h starting 3h after embolic injury and the degree of brain injury, astrocytosis and vascular remodeling were examined using histological and immunohistochemical analysis 8 days later. Changes in core temperature, blood glucose concentration, oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored. Microsphere injection induced multiple sites of focal damage in the ipsilateral subcortical regions. Massive numbers of microglia accumulated within the core of the tissue damage whereas astrocytes were located in the penumbra. There was no difference in the degree of brain injury between the young and aged control rats. However the aged rats showed less injury-induced astrocytosis and greater vascular remodeling. Intravenous infusion of GPE 3h after the injury reduced overall damage scores in both young (p<0.01) and aged rats (p<0.05). GPE-treatment reduced astrocytosis in young, but not aged animals and did not significantly alter the vascular remodeling in either age group. The data suggested that the neuroprotection of the tripeptide is independent of cerebral reperfusion and is not age selective.
