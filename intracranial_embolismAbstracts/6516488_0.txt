It is reported on the clinical and morphological findings of two women with obliterating thrombendangiitis who finally died of the sequelae of this vascular disease at the age of 36 years and 64 years, respectively, after a 14-year and 10-month duration of the disease. Despite generalisation or multilocalisation of the disease only the cerebral symptomatology was clinically manifest. The diagnosis obliterating thrombendangiitis could be verified only by histological investigations post mortem. In the second case intracranially exclusively a venous affection of the vessels of the cerebral sinuses, of ascending veins of the cerebral covering and profound cerebral veins with differently old inflammation foci in the sense of an obliterating thrombendangiitis was present. It is referred to the general problems of diagnosis, etiopathogenesis and therapy of the obliterating thrombendangiitis.
