In a patient who had a calcified left atrial myxoma resected, recurrence developed 31 months later. Although complete radical resection of the recurrent tumour presented a special problem, the patient survived the second operation. The tumour recurred again and the patient had two episodes of cerebral embolism 1 1/2 and 2 years later, respectively, and died 3 1/2 years after the second operation. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate correlated with the size of the tumor, and the recurrent tumour seemed to grow more rapidly than the primary tumour. Experience with this case and a review of the nine reported cases of recurrent left atrial myxoma suggest that a radical approach is necessary at the primary operation.
