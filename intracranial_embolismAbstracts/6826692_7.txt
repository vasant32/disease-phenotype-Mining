Neurological assessments were done regularly during hospitalization in 283 consecutive patients (mean age 73 yr) with acute cerebrovascular disease treated at the Stroke Unit of Serafimerlasarettet. A preplanned investigation program and strict criteria for diagnosis and treatment were followed. Hospital mortality was 18%. Patients with a major cerebral infarction or haemorrhage often died very early during the hospital period and deaths due to complications increased significantly during the second week. Multivariate analysis regarding mortality showed that a low neurological score and heart failure were the most important factors for the short-term prognosis. In those patients with cerebral infarction, ambulatory capacity and ECG-diagnosed bundle branch block added significantly to the prognostic power of the neurological score. Among the 227 patients discharged alive, 1 and 2-yr mortality was 14 and 18% respectively. Here, the most important long-term prognostic factors were age and ST changes on the ECG. Again, considering only patients with cerebral infarction (N = 190), bundle branch block was found to be the single most useful predictive factor. Prognostication in acute ischemic stroke should thus be based not only on neurological findings but on careful evaluation of associated cardiac disease, especially in the long-term perspective.
