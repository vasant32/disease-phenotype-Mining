Operative stroke complicating carotid endarterectomy is traditionally treated by reexploration of the operative site to correct a potentially causative lesion; however, attempts are not made to diagnose or treat the intracranial arterial occlusion. A 65-year-old man had a right hemiplegia during a left carotid endarterectomy that was caused by premature reversal of heparin, which resulted in thrombosis of his left anterior cerebral artery. On reexploration, the patient was treated with a 1-hour infusion of 1 million U urokinase through an indwelling carotid shunt. A repeat arteriogram demonstrated patency of the left anterior cerebral artery, with complete clot dissolution and resolution of the right hemiplegia on awakening. Natural history studies of stroke and prospective, angiographically controlled clinical trials of intraarterial thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke support the use of intraoperative intraarterial infusion of urokinase as part of a therapeutic approach to patients who have an ischemic stroke during carotid endarterectomy.
