Papillary fibroelastoma (PFE) is a benign primary tumor of the heart usually originating from the heart valves. Nonvalvular fibroelastomas are rare, and reported cases have presented either incidentally or with cerebral embolic phenomena; none have reported recurrent anginal symptoms. We are reporting a case of a 53-year-old female with history of significant radiation exposure to the chest in the past, who presented with recurrent chest pain and was found to have left atrial nonvalvular PFE managed with surgical excision.â€ƒ
