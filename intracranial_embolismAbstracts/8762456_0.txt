Acetylsalvianolic acid A (ASAA) is a semisynthetic analogue of salvianolic acid A isolated from Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge). A rat middle cerebral artery thrombosis model was made by adding FeCl3 to the surface of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Using this model, the protective effects of ASAA on focal cerebral ischemic injury were studied. The neurologic status of each rat was carefully evaluated at 4, 8 and 24 h after surgery. The cerebral infarction and the morphological changes of brain tissue were examined. Pretreatment with ASAA 50 or 100 mg.kg-1 iv was shown to significantly reduce the cerebral infarction and attenuate neurological deficits. The degree of inhibition of cerebral infarction were 46.5% (P < 0.05) and 87.4% (P < 0.01), respectively. In pathological examination, pretreatment with ASAA 100 mg.kg-1 iv, there was no thrombosis or only a little thrombosis in MCA. The extent of tissue ischemia was much less than that of control. These results indicate that the beneficial effects of ASAA on focal cerebral ischemic rats subjected to middle cerebral artery thrombosis may be related to its antithrombotic effect.
