Congenital nephrotic syndrome, a rare form of nephrosis, presents during the first year of life. We describe the case of a patient seen on the fifth day of life with seizures, hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, and cerebral deep venous thromboses. Whereas these are generally long-term complications of this disorder, they may also be the presenting features in the neonatal period.
