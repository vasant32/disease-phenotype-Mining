138 patients with Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (n = 96), atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT; n = 27) and the other supraventricular tachycardia (n = 15), were divided into two groups, a control group (less than 65 years old; n = 108) and an elderly group (more than 66 years old; n = 30). We then estimated the success rate and safety of radiofrequency ablation for supraventricular tachycardia in elderly patients. For WPW syndrome, there were 76 (97%) successes and 9 (13%) recurrences in the control group (n = 78). In the elderly group of WPW patients, the number of successes was 18 (100%) and the number of recurrences one (63%). In 27 patients with AVNRT, the number of successes was 26 (96%) and there were no recurrences. In 15 patients with some other supraventricular tachycardia, there were 11 patients (73%) successes and one recurrence (11%). Major complications consisted of cardiac tamponade in 2 patients, dissecting aneurysm in one patient and cerebral embolism in one patients. All major complications occurred in patients with WPW syndrome. The cause of the complications, except the cerebral embolism was manipulation of the electrical or ablation catheter. Three of four patients with major complications belonged to the control group. It is possible that radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachycardia in elderly patients is safe and highly effective. However, it is still invasive therapy. Ablation on a left accessory pathway by the transaortic valve approach especially needs meticulous care.
