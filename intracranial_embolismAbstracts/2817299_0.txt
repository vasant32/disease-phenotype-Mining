A 9-year-old girl with recurrent episodes of unconsciousness, with or without convulsions, was reported. The episodes, which have been observed 9 times over the last 6 years, were characterized by generalized or hemi-convulsions, associated features of headache and vomiting, disturbance of consciousness lasting for a few days, slow activity on EEG continuing for a few weeks after the episodes and no prophylactic effect of anticonvulsants. Repeated EEG examinations revealed no epileptic discharges. Cerebral angiography showed corkscrew-like veins in the frontal region. Cerebral venous thrombosis is strongly suggested as the underlying cause of her episodes.
