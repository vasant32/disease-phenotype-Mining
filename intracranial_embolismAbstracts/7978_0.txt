From a study bearing upon 26 patients suffering from a cerebral circulatory insufficiency induced by a stenosis or a thrombosis, the writers analyse the part played by Hyperbare Oxygen in the neurologic evolution. The defining of the efficacy criteria enabled them to determine whenever this part was prevalent and obvious (that's to say in 20 p. 100 of the cases). However, in the other cases it was hard to decide whether Hyperbare Oxygen played any part. Only functional lesions are liable to benefit from this therapy which seems mainly useful to cover the period of circulatory adaptation at a time when supply circulations may come into play. The difficulty to appreciate the importance of supply circulations urges on to treat this type of patients early enough in a systematic way and all the more so as they are young.
