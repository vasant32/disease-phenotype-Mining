Cardiac hydatid cyst is rarely encountered and constitutes 0.5%-2% of all hydatid cases. Although left ventricular (LV) location for hydatid cysts has been frequently reported, the involvement of both the left ventricle and the interventricular septum (IVS) has not been previously reported in the literature. We present a case of cardiac hydatid cyst with fatal recurrent cerebral embolism and the unusual involvement of both LV and IVS demonstrated by transthoracic echocardiography.
