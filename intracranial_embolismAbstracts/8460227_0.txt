The association of antiphospholipid antibodies with unexplained thrombo-occlusive vascular disease is well known but often remains unrecognized. The most well-studied clinical manifestation is venous thrombosis, but arterial occlusive disease involving multiple sites is also well documented. Twenty-six cases of thrombo-occlusive disease were observed in 22 patients over a 3-year period. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography were used to make the diagnoses. None of the patients who underwent angiography or venography developed thrombolytic disease related to the puncture site. This group of patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome had a wide distribution of arterial and venous thrombotic disease. Radiologists should consider antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in the differential diagnosis when evaluating thrombo-occlusive vascular disease that is unexpected or occurs without risk factors. Knowledge of antiphospholipid antibody status has important implications for prognosis and therapy.
