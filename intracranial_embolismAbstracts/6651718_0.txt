We report a case of cerebral air embolism caused by pulmonary barotrauma in a diver. Severe neurological symptoms, deterioration during decompression, and a prolonged, complicated, initial pressure profile indicated the need for saturation therapy. Few clinical cases treated by saturation recompression therapy (SRT) have been reported since its introduction in 1978 (1,5). SRT is an effective alternative for the management of complicated and persistent accidents involving intravascular bubbles.
