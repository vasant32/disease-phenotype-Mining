A rare presentation of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is described in a young woman. Arterial TOS caused by a cervical rib produced acute upper extremity ischemia due to subclavian artery aneurysm formation. Clinical presentation also included left hemiparesis caused by right subclavian artery thrombosis and retrograde embolization of thrombus via the common carotid artery to the right middle cerebral artery distribution. Surgical repair of the subclavian artery was performed, but permanent neurologic deficit remained. Acute thrombosis of the right subclavian artery can produce cerebrovascular complication. The assessment of such risk in patients with arterial TOS is warranted and the arterial lesion corrected surgically.
