BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Mechanical prostheses are used in young patients, the CarboMedics valve having been the mechanical valve of choice of the present authors during the past 15 years. The study aim was to analyze long-term clinical and echocardiographic results obtained with CarboMedics mechanical valves. METHODS: A total of 2,953 patients underwent valve replacement with the CarboMedics valve between 1988 and 2004 at the Montreal Heart Institute. Patients were prospectively followed at the outpatient valve clinic. Subsequently, 1,004 patients underwent echocardiographic examinations during follow up. RESULTS: In total, 1,597 patients (mean age 57 +/- 12 years) underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR), 1,043 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10 years) underwent isolated mitral valve replacement (MVR), and 313 patients (mean age 58 +/- 11 years) underwent AVR+MVR. The mean five-, 10- and 15-year actuarial survival rates were 83 +/- 1%, 70 +/- 2% and 62 +/- 3% in AVR patients, 76 +/- 1%, 59 +/- 2% and 40 +/- 14% in MVR patients, and 68 +/- 3%, 51 +/- 4% and 33 +/- 9% in AVR+MVR patients. The mean 15-year freedom from cerebral embolism, hemorrhage and reoperation was 95 +/- 1%, 97 +/- 1% and 95 +/- 1% in AVR patients, 92 +/- 1%, 97 +/- 1% and 93 +/- 1% in MVR patients, and 94 +/- 2%, 93 +/- 2% and 91 +/- 4% in AVR+MVR patients. AVR patients had a mean aortic gradient of 29 +/- 14, 20 +/- 8, 18 +/- 7, 16 +/- 7, 12 +/- 5 and 11 +/- 5 mmHg with 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 mm prostheses, respectively (p = 0.001). MVR patients had a mean mitral gradient of 5.3 +/- 3, 4.9 +/- 2.2, 4.6 +/- 2, 4.4 +/- 2.9 and 4.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg with 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 mm prostheses, respectively (p = 0.63). CONCLUSION: Patient survival and valve-related complications were satisfactory at 15 years after valve replacement with the CarboMedics valve. Mean aortic gradients were high with the 19-mm aortic prostheses, but all other valve sizes showed good hemodynamic performance, as measured using transthoracic echocardiography.
