Transesophageal echocardiography performed in a group of 36 patients who had a first cerebral embolic event after implantation of a mechanical cardiac valvular prosthesis revealed that stroke is associated with the presence of left atrial thrombi more frequently than transient ischemic attacks. Intracardiac embolic sources other than thrombi are possibly related more often to the latter type of cerebral embolism in this patient population.
