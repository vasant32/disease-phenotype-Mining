A patient with cerebral fat embolism was followed by computed tomography (CT). For the first few days after injury, CT revealed no abnormality. About a week later, multiple low density areas appeared in the white matter of the frontal region. They disappeared within the subsequent 2 weeks while subdural effusions developed in the fronto-parieto-temporal regions. As neurologic recovery progressed, the subdural effusions gradually diminished and cerebral atrophy was seen.
