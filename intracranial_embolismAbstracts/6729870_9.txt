Five patients with nonseptic cerebral embolism of cardiac origin are reported in whom early anticoagulant therapy resulted in clinical deterioration or death from frank hemorrhage into the acute infarct. In each patient an initial CT scan excluded the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage and a second CT scan, after clinical deterioration had occurred, documented frank hemorrhage into the infarcted zone. All five patients had large infarctions in the right middle cerebral artery territory and three patients were mildly hypertensive. Four patients received heparin within 36 hours of their stroke and one was on warfarin at time of the embolism. Clinical deterioration occurred after intervals of several hours (2 cases), 5-6 days (2 cases) and 30 days (1 case). In only 2 patients was anticoagulant activity excessive at time of clinical deterioration. This report illustrates the danger of early anticoagulant therapy of acute nonseptic cerebral embolism, particularly in the setting of large infarction.
