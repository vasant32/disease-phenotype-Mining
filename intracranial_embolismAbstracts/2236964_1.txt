Adults, especially high-aged patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) are said to have a higher operative risk than younger ones because of fragility of their myocardium, bleeding from rich collateral circulation to lungs, and other complications such as brain abscess and endocarditis. It is often difficult to determine the surgical risk for total correction in cases of high-aged patients who have such complications. We report a successfully operated high-aged case of TOF with marked left ventricular dysfunction. A 52-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of exertional dyspnea and cyanosis. He had a history of cerebral embolism and meningitis several months prior to admission. On admission, he was NYHA class 3, and cyanosis and clubbed fingers were present. Cardiac catheterization showed a large VSD, 50% over-riding of the aorta and an infundibular pulmonary stenosis. Right to left shunt was 60% and Qp/Qs was 0.38. The left ventricular end diastolic volume index was 109 ml/m2, slightly larger than normal, and the ejection fraction was only 30%. This left ventricular dysfunction was thought to be caused by fibrosis of the myocardium due to longstanding hypoxemia and hypoxemia itself. There is no previous case report dealing with a successful total correction for a high-aged patient with TOF associated with such a severe left ventricular dysfunction. Congestive heart failure in the post-operative period was successfully treated by catecholamine for two weeks. Postoperative cardiac catheterization showed a small left-to-right shunt, and an improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction from 30% to 38%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
