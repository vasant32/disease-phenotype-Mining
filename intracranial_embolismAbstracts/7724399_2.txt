In ICD patients thromboembolic events (TEEs) are described as possible complications at implant or during the follow-up. We report four cases of TEEs (two peripheral and two cerebral; 6.5% of patients) that occurred in our series during a mean follow-up of 19.4 months. The patients had chronic postinfarction LV aneurysm (3) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (1). None had previous embolisms nor evidence of left atrial or LV clots at standard preoperative transthoracic echocardiography. No paroxysms of atrial fibrillation were documented prior or after ICD implant. We discuss the possible causes of embolization and the suitability of anticoagulant therapy in ICD patients.
