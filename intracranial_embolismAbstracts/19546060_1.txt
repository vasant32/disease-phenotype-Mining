Robotic totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting (TECAB) can be performed on the arrested heart or on the beating heart without heart-lung machine support. In high-risk patients or in patients where technical difficulties are expected with a complete off-pump approach, a beating heart concept with heart-lung machine support can be an important option. Femoral arterial cannulation is associated with additional risk of retrograde cerebral embolization, and axillary cannulation is an accepted method in aortic surgery. We describe a case where an axillary artery cannulation method was used for the first time in TECAB performed with the da Vinci telemanipulation system.
