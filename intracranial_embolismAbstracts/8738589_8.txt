The protective effects of ticlopidine and d,l-lysine acetylsalicylate (L-ASA), used alone and in combination, on the pathogenesis of thrombosis in cerebral blood vessels were investigated in a rat animal model using a He-Ne laser method. Ticlopidine and L-ASA, given orally at a concentration from 100 mg/kg, inhibited thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner. Ticlopidine (300 mg/kg p.o.) inhibited thrombosis in arterioles and venules for 3 days after administration. The inhibitory activity of L-ASA (300 mg/kg p.o.) was less prolonged than that of ticlopidine and was observed for only approximately 24 h. Combined administration of ticlopidine and L-ASA significantly enhanced and prolonged the antithrombotic effects of either drug given alone. The results demonstrate that ticlopidine and L-ASA have potent antithrombotic properties in rat cerebral blood vessels in vivo.
