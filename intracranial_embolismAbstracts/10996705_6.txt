Detection of clinically silent circulating microemboli within cerebral arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (US) is now being widely investigated in the hope of identifying patients at increased risk for stroke. However, the widespread application of embolus detection is still limited in clinical practice because current transcranial Doppler systems have not the required sensitivity and specificity to analyze microembolic signals, particularly to distinguish between gaseous, or solid brain emboli and artefacts. In this work, we proposed to investigate the potential of a new approach for the analysis of microembolic signals via the so-called matching pursuit, which is closely related to wavelet transform and is not subject to the same limitations as the fast Fourier transform. Our preliminary results clearly indicate that matching pursuit is well suited to this task.
