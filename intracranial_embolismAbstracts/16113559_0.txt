A rare case of sudden death due to cerebral embolization of trophoblastic tissue and concomitant massive pulmonary embolization following artificial abortion in a 42-year-old woman with poorly regulated hypertension and chronic smoking is described. Histopathological analysis showed syncytiotrophoblast cells, positive on hPL immunostaining, obstructing vascular lumina in the small perforating arteries irrigating the diencephalon. There was no trophoblast invasion of capillary walls. Severe perivascular edema and lymphocytic infiltration were observed. No trophoblastic cells were found in the pulmonary circulation.
