Prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism has been recently identified as a cause of venous thrombosis. However the association between this mutation and arterial thrombosis remains uncertain. Some authors have suggested that the polymorphism in the 3' region of the prothrombin gene may precipitate cerebral arterial thrombosis in young patients with prothrombotic conditions. We report a case of post-traumatic basilar artery thrombosis in a young patient carrier of the prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism. Thirty-six hours after sustaining a head injury in the occipital region, a young man developed vomiting, headache, dizziness and truncal ataxia, without signs of focal impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging and selective angiography carried out 2 days later showed an obstruction of the basilar artery, with infarction of the right cerebellar region. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a patent foramen ovale with little left-to-right shunt and an aneurysm of the interatrial septum. Blood examination showed a heterozygous status for prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism. We conclude that this prothrombin gene mutation and the coexisting particular head injury and interatrial septal aneurysm could have contributed simultaneously to the development of basilar artery occlusion and cerebellar infarction. We suggest that in selected cases of cerebellar ischemia a prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism should be considered.
