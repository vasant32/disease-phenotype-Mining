Neurological deficits such as stroke and subtle psychological, cognitive, and behavioral changes are known risks associated with cardiac surgery. These altered neurologic outcomes have a significant impact on patients and their quality of life postoperatively. Perioperative events, such as cerebral embolism and decrease in cerebral oxygenation and hypoperfusion have been identified as factors causal in producing adverse neurologic outcomes. More importantly, a number of mechanisms related to operative techniques have been found to cause these adverse events. Identifying practices associated with adverse outcomes and implementing practice changes may benefit clinical outcomes for cardiac surgery patients. Standardizing techniques among clinicians will also achieve continuous quality improvement in the process of care. Optimal intra-operative management systems contribute significantly to ensuring good patient outcomes (i.e., avoiding neurological injury in patients which is an important cause of post-operative morbidity and mortality). Groom and colleagues (2004) have developed a system to obtain a thorough understanding and redesign of the process of care associated with cardiac surgery. They have developed a system that simultaneously measures some embolic activity, cerebral oxygen saturation, and physiologic parameters, as well as uses a video recording device during cardiac surgery. To date, the evaluation of this methodology in a rigorous, prospective manner has not been reported. Our aim is to conduct a randomised clinical trial to evaluate the influence of continuous quality improvement in cardiac surgery using biofeedback (i.e., real time information on physiologic functioning from an integrated monitoring system) to reduce the incidence of potentially adverse events during surgery. By achieving the outcomes of this project, we plan to be able to not only introduce change in our own practice, but provide a framework for other units to introduce change.
