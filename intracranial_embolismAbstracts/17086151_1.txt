INTRODUCTION: We report a case of amyloid cardiopathy revealed by a cerebral embolism. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old patient was admitted with a right hemiplegia and aphasia due to an infarction in the middle cerebral artery territory. Echocardiography was suggestive of an amyloid cardiopathy, and an IgG lambda multiple myeloma with renal insufficiency was discovered. The patient died suddenly 4 months later after chemotherapy was initiated. CONCLUSION: Embolic complications are rare and late in cardiac amyloidosis. The diagnosis may be suspected by echocardiography.
