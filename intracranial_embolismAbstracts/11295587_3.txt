We describe a 46-year-old man who developed infective endocarditis, meningitis, sternal abscess, and infective cerebral emboli after cardiac transplantation. Staphylococcus aureus was the infective organism. We successfully managed the patient with flucloxacillin and fusidic acid to treat infection, and with prostacyclin for systemic embolization.
