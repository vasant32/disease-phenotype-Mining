Two siblings, ages 14 and 23, with various features of sinus node dysfunction have been reported. Sinus bradycardia was the presenting feature in both patients. During the follow-up period both patients developed various types of ectopic rhythms which increased with exercise. One of them developed "silent atrium" at the age of 23 and had cerebral embolus as a complication. The other patient had frequent syncopal episodes and had to be treated with a combination of electronic pacemaker and antiarrhythmic drugs.
