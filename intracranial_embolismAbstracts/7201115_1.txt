A 9 1/2-year-old boy developed a progressive dyskinesia 7 years after an angiographically demonstrated internal cerebral vein thrombosis. CT revealed bilateral thalamic lesions, more severe on the side contralateral to the movement disorder, without striatal involvement. This is a rare example of survival after internal cerebral vein thrombosis in a child and demonstrates that movement disorders may be delayed consequences of childhood stroke.
