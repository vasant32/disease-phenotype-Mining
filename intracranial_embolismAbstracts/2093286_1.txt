Rhinocerebral mucormycosis can be a rapidly fatal course disease if the institution of treatment is delayed. We describe a case of a long-term dialysis patient in which the role of a siderophore such as Deferoxamine in promoting mucormycosis is discussed. The frequent lack of early diagnosis, itself subsequent to a break away from the standard diagnostic tools (apart from biopsy and culture) makes the survival prognosis particularly critical.
