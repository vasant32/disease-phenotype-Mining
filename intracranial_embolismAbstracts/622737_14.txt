In a canine stroke model, dose dependent protection by postocclusion pentobarbital was suggested from 10--40 mg/kg. In 28 dogs investigated (10 from a previous study) a distinct, significant reduction in right cerebral hemisphere infarction occurred in animals given 15--20 mg/kg pentobarbital intramuscularly 1 hour postocclusion. Increased dosages did not alter statistically the infarct size and 2 dogs at the 50 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg levels died of barbiturate-induced respiratory failure.
