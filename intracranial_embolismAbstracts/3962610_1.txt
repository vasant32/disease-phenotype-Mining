The authors present the case of a hypertensive patient with a thrombosis of a saccular microaneurysm (SMA) and underlying cerebral (pontine) lacunae. This SMA lay at the junction between the main vessel and two small feeding arteries penetrating into the necrotic territory. Microhemorrhages were observed in and outside the aneurysmal wall. Very sinuous narrow channels of recanalization crossed the thrombosis between the upstream and downstream vessels. The anatomical relationship between the SMA and the lacunae has been histologically demonstrated.
