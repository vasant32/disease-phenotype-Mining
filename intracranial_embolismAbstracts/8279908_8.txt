Two adjunctive techniques for operations involving the aortic arch, retrograde perfusion of cold oxygenated blood through the superior vena cava and establishment of antegrade flow after hypothermic circulatory arrest, are described. These techniques should reduce or possibly eliminate the embolization of air and particulate matter into the cerebral circulation and may reduce the incidence of brain injury.
