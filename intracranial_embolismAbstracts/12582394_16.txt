BACKGROUND: Aside from anecdotal reports, there are few data on the risk of thrombotic complications in patients in whom use of warfarin and aspirin is discontinued perioperatively for cutaneous operation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to present a large case series of thrombotic complications resulting from this practice and to estimate the incidence of these events. METHODS: A total of 504 members of the American College of Mohs Micrographic Surgery and Cutaneous Oncology were surveyed regarding thrombotic complications when blood thinners were withheld perioperatively to ascertain the frequency of these complications and to describe associated morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 168 responding physicians reported 46 patients who experienced thrombotic events. Of these patients, 54% (25 of 46) experienced the event when warfarin was withheld and 39% (18 of 46) when aspirin use was discontinued. Thrombotic events included 24 strokes, 3 cerebral emboli, 5 myocardial infarctions, 8 transient ischemic attacks, 3 deep venous thromboses, 2 pulmonary emboli, and 1 retinal artery occlusion leading to blindness. Three deaths were reported. Calculation of incidence yielded an estimated thrombotic risk of 1 event per 12,816 operations, 1 in 6219 operations when use of warfarin was discontinued and 1 in 21,448 when aspirin was withheld. CONCLUSIONS: With no documented increase in severe hemorrhagic complications during continued use perioperatively of blood thinners, these data provide a compelling argument to maintain patients on medically necessary blood thinners during cutaneous operation. All relevant clinical facts must be weighed when making this decision.
