BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although it is often assumed in experimental stroke studies that cautery-induced occlusion is permanent, surgeons commonly expect cauterized vessels to recanalize spontaneously. We used the rat middle cerebral artery to determine if electrocoagulation would produce a permanent occlusion in this preparation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A standard bipolar coagulator, calibrated to determine actual power output, was adjusted to induce platelet aggregation in the middle cerebral artery of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats without inducing bleeding through the arterial wall. A reliable temporary thrombosis was induced by a Malis Bipolar Coagulator set to deliver 10 bursts of 1.5 seconds each at a rate of 24 min-1 and a power setting of 3 W. This thrombus was responsive to the antithrombotic agent flunarizine. An apparently permanent occlusion was produced by 30 bursts at 3 W followed by 20 bursts at 5 W. To our surprise, seven of seven such occlusions recanalized spontaneously within 4 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The electrocoagulation process commonly used in experimental stroke studies may produce only a temporary occlusion of the rat middle cerebral artery.
