Extracranial carotid artery (CA) aneurysms are rare in the pediatric population and are usually the result of connective tissue disorders, traumatic dissection, or infection. The authors present the case of a large calcified internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm of obscure origins presenting with embolic stroke in a child. Aneurysm excision and CA reconstruction would have been extremely difficult due to the distal location of the lesion, and CA ligation was contraindicated due to a failed balloon test occlusion. Therefore, after anticoagulation therapy, the patient was treated endovascularly with a covered stent and complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation. The patient recovered all neurological function and has remained in excellent condition. A follow-up angiogram performed at 6 months showed no recurrence or stenosis.
