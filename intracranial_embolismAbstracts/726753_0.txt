Cerebellar infarctions are a relatively rare disorder, the diagnosis of which even based on clinical, angiographical and ventriculographic studies is rather difficult. Of big service in such conditions are computer tomographies. In extensive isolated cerebellar infarctions with signs of developing occlusional hydrocephaly with brain stem compressions, there may be indications to surgical operations. The paper contains the literary review, where problems of diagnosis and treatment of cerebellar infarctions are considered. The paper also contains a description of one case where a surgical operation was performed with a good outcome.
