Stokes-Adams attacks are fairly common in children with congenital complete heart block, but the occurrence of cerebral infarction is quite unusual. We present the case of a 13-year-old boy with congenital heart block and an embolic stroke involving the cerebral artery. Echocardiography revealed no valvular regurgitation, hypokinetic segments, mural thrombus, or myxoma. Electrocardiographic monitoring demonstrated good response of ventricular rate to exercise and no episodes of atrial or ventricular dysrhythmia. It is assumed that embolism occurred due to bradycardia.
