BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to develop an MR imaging-compatible animal model of reversible embolic stroke. We hypothesize that real-time MR imaging of the brain can be performed during stroke thrombolysis and can provide real-time feedback and guidance on the success of thrombolysis. METHODS: Embolic strokes were induced in 5 adult dogs by the use of autologous blood clots, with a sixth dog serving as an experimental control. Serial MR anatomic and physiologic imaging was performed to track the evolution of the stroke. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and quantitative cerebral blood flow (qCBF) were compared in the normal and stroke regions. During and after the administration of a chemical thrombolytic agent, MR imaging was performed to assess the outcome of the treatment. RESULTS: Strokes were successfully created in 5 animals. No ADC or qCBF changes were observed in the control animal. Both ADC and qCBF values were found to be significantly different in the region affected by the stroke. Restoration of flow was observed in 1 case. CONCLUSION: We have successfully implemented an MR imaging-compatible canine model of reversible embolic stroke.
