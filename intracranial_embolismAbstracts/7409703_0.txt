The effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic measures depends upon their adequacy in the individual diagnostic situation. This is also true for stroke which is a superimposed concept for different mechanisms leading to acute localized brain ischemia. For the choice of treatment we have to consider in each case the actual clinical situation, i.e. the natural stage of disease, the localization of cerebral dysfunction and its etiology and pathogenesis. Thus transient ischemic attacks (TIA), completed stroke with prolonged complete, partial or no recovery and progressive stroke (stroke in evolution) demand different treatment. Concerning pathogenesis it is important to differentiate between intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemia due to extracranial carotid stenosis or occlusion, intracranial arterial thrombosis, predominantly hemodynamic pathogenesis and embolism of cardiac origin. Prevention of stroke may be of general kind like treatment of hypertension or other risk factors for apoplexy, and there are more specific measures like surgery of vascular obliteration and treatment with agents inhibiting platelet aggregation (Aspirin) or anticoagulants. The indications for the various surgical and medical procedures are discussed. Because of the risk of hemorrhagic complications the indication for anticoagulants is limited considerably. The treatment of completed stroke has to consider the normalization of basic functions (cardiocirculatory, respiration, water-electrolyte balance a.o.). Vasoactive and especially vasodilatatory drugs are not recommended in the acute stage of stroke, as their effectiveness is not secure and may even be disadvantageous. Ischemic brain edema is treated with mannitol or sorbit and with dexamethasone although its effectiveness has not yet been proven. Low molecular dextran solution is supposed to improve microcirculation in the ischemic tissue by means of hemodilution i.e. improvement of rheological properties.
