Coagulation necrosis is a peculiar type of ischemic necrosis that is characterized by firm, eosinophilic parenchyma with recognizable cell outlines without massive glial reactions. This is an autopsy report of coagulation necrosis 6 months after thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator therapy against massive cerebral embolism in an 84-year-old man with atrial fibrillation.
