We describe a 30-year-old woman with a normal appearing coronary artery associated with SLE who suffered myocardial infarction with left ventricular aneurysm and systemic embolization including cerebral infarctions and saddle embolism. The patient was surgically treated with good results. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of systemic embolism due to myocardial infarction occurring in SLE with a normal coronary artery.
