The records of 920 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy by the same surgeon (M. D'A) between 1976 and 1989 were reviewed. Particular attention was paid to both the neurological and general complications and to how and when the neurological symptoms appeared. Among these patients, a cumulative stroke plus death rate of 3.1% was observed. Complications were classified as clamping ischemia (2.2%), postoperative embolism (1.5%), postoperative thrombosis (2.4%), and cerebral haemorrhage (0.3%). Two patients (0.2%) died from myocardial infarction. In 3.5% of patients, neurological symptoms were transient. The incidence of clamping ischemia was higher when 40 mmHg was considered as the safety limit of the back-pressure; this incidence fell by raising this limit to 50 mmHg, and introducing, in recent years, SEPs monitoring. Intraoperative monitoring of SEPs, in fact, reduced the neurological complications to 1.4%, while intraoperative angiography reduced the need for intraoperative reoperation from 10% to 2%. The use of antiplatelet drugs and an accurate surgical technique are useful steps in the prevention of postoperative embolism or thrombosis.
