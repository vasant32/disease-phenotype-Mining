Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are benign tumors that usually arise from the valvular endocardium. They are clinically important because of their propensity to embolize. We describe, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of a papillary fibroelastoma arising from the left atrial appendage, giving rise to multiple cerebral embolic events. The tumor was excised surgically, with no further embolic events.
