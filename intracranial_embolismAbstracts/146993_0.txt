In hypertensive disease and atherosclerosis without acute disorders of cerebral circulation it was established that in the cerebral vessel walls there was a high activity of alkaline phosphatase and adenosintriphosphtase. In the symmetrical areas of the subcortical nodes differences in the activity of these enzymes were insignificant and not valid. In vessel walls, located in the peripheral zone of the apoplectic hemorrhage and in the adjacent brain tissue the activity of alkaline phosphatase and adenosintriphosphatase drops. The existence of a high activity of enzymes in the vessel walls on the early stages of hemorrhages gives ground to the authors to claim that in the peripheral zone of an extensive hemorrhage a drop in the enzyme activity appears in the process of a development of a stroke.
