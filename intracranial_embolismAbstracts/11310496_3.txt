Cerebral embolism in relation to cardiac amyloidosis has not been widely noted. A 47-year-old woman who had been suffering from familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) for 7 years was treated with partial liver transplantation from a living donor and her early postoperative course was uneventful. During the 391st to 613th postoperative day she experienced recurrent cerebral infarctions, but clinical examinations revealed no disorders capable of producing cerebral embolism. At autopsy splenic infarction and intracardiac thrombi adhering to the mitral valve and left atrium were found, and these areas showed severe amyloid deposition. Amyloid heart is considered to be one possible cause of systemic embolism.
