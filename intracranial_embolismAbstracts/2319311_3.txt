Five cases of retrograde thrombosis of former feeding arteries after removal of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are reported. The clinical features of these patients were studied and compared to those of 71 patients without this complication. The following characteristics were found to correlate with retrograde thrombosis: 1) advancing age of the patient; 2) large AVM size; and 3) markedly dilated and elongated feeders. It is suggested that the slow flow in the former feeding arteries that was observed immediately after AVM removal and pathological changes in these vessels due to long-standing hemodynamic stresses contributed to the development of retrograde thrombosis. Neurological manifestations related to retrograde thrombosis were noted in three of the five cases. Although infrequent, this complication should be considered as a serious possibility following removal of an AVM.
