In the years 1965--1978 thrombosis of the intracranial vessels of different aetiology was diagnosed in 204 patients treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Medical Academy in Warsaw. The authors selected from this group 8 cases described in greater detail in which there was an evident temporal relationship between trauma and the development of the disease. The severity of the sustained trauma was without a significant influence on the development of post-traumatic thrombosis. Clinical Manifestations increased in intensity usually within the first 48 hours and in only one case they appeared 2 weeks after trauma. In the clinical status of the patients of considerable interest was usually absence of disturbances of consciousness with presence of serious signs of focal central nervous system damage. Of decisive diagnostic significance was cerebral angiography which localized the site of thrombosis and excluded presence of post-traumatic intracerebral haematoma. In 7 cases thrombosis affected the main trunk or branches of the middle cerebral artery. The prognosis as to survival of such patients is generally good but in most cases disability of different degree developed following thrombosis.
