The effect of neuroprotective drugs on the early and late electrophysiological manifestations of photothrombotic occlusion of distal branches of middle cerebral artery was studied in rats treated with MK-801 and Cerebrolysin (CL). DC potentials were recorded from the irradiated cortex (ischemic core), from the adjacent penumbra zone and from remote intact cortex. Irradiation elicited after a few minutes of spontaneous spreading depression (SD) waves followed during 10-15 min by focal ischemic depolarization (FID) developing in the irradiated cortex and spreading into the perifocal areas. While the core FID amplitude reached about 30 mV and decayed during subsequent 2 h to 10-13 mV, FID in the penumbra zone was broken by periods of partial repolarization and returned during 30-90 min almost to baseline. At the same time, generation of spontaneous SD waves almost stopped. MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 45 min after ischemia) blocked SD waves, but did not shorten penumbra FID, the decay of which was slowed down to the rate found in the ischemic core. CL treatment (2.5 ml/kg, i.p. , 1 h after ischemia) did not influence FID in the acute phase of the experiment, but its 10-day administration facilitated post-ischemic recovery indicated by higher amplitude of evoked SD waves penetrating into the former penumbra zone. Morphological examination showed that the volume of total and partial necrosis was increased in the MK-801 group and marginally reduced in the CL group. It is suggested that the absence of the SD-induced hyperperfusion episodes in MK-801-treated rats may accelerate perifocal thrombotization in this model of focal ischemia.
