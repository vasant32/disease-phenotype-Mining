A case, which is clinically characterized by a subacute vertebrobasilar syndrome, is presented. The necropsy reveals multiple infarcts in brainstem, cerebellum and left cerebral hemisphere, due to tumoural emboli of a non-detected primary tumour. It is postulated that the latter has to originate in the lungs in order to produce this unique type of cerebral arterial embolism.
