A population-based study of the relation between hematocrit and stroke subtype was carried out among 2,077 individuals using the Lehigh Valley Stroke Register. This register identifies all stroke patients admitted to the 8 acute care hospitals serving the Lehigh Valley area of eastern Pennsylvania-western New Jersey. The mean hematocrit was higher in patients with lacunes than with thrombotic or embolic strokes (p = 0.02). However, when blood pressure was also considered the increase in hematocrit in patients with lacunar stroke was significant only when systolic hypertension (greater than or equal to 150 mm Hg) was also present (p = 0.029); no significant difference in hematocrit was found between stroke subtypes in normotensive individuals. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that hypertension interacts with hematocrit in accounting for the observed association with lacunar infarcts. There was no trend for increased in-hospital mortality for stroke patients in either the low (less than or equal to 30, 30-36%) or high (greater than or equal to 47%) hematocrit groups.
