Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a strong predictor of stroke and represents a potential source of cerebral emboli. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an association exists between mitral annular calcification and carotid atheroma. In addition, the characteristics of carotid atheromas were compared between patients with and without mitral annular calcification. The authors found that there was a significant association between the presence of mitral annular calcification and carotid atheroma. Mitral annular calcification in the elderly may be a form of atherosclerosis.
