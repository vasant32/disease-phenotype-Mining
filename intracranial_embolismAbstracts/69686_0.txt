The current literature indicates nuclear brain images typically return to normal within two to three months following an episode of cerebral infarction. In this report, two patients are described who demonstrated no significant change in their brain scan abnormalities 11 and 17 months following their strokes. Computed tomography confirmed the clinical impression that the persistent brain scan abnormalities were due to cerebral infarction rather than to neoplastic process.
