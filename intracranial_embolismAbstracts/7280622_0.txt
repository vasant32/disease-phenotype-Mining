Mitral valve prolapse syndrome is the most widespread cardiac disease (3-8% of subjects presumed healthy) but the auscultatory findings are still too little known and may often cause misunderstanding. Although the prognosis is generally excellent, it may in rare cases be complicated by infective endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, rupture of chordae tendineae, severe arrhythmias which may be the cause of sudden death and recurrent transient cerebral ischemic attacks. These last two rare complications are illustrated by two clinical cases, and the pathogenesis and therapy are discussed.
