A 62-year-old man with lung cancer underwent a right lower bilobectomy of the lung. After resection, we insufflated air through the diaphragm into the peritoneal cavity, and sudden cardiac arrest developed in the patient. A large number of air bubbles were aspirated from the heart and great vessels, and the patient recovered after resuscitation. However, he remained with a left sensory deficit, a left homonymous hemianopia, and left hemiparesis. A brain computed tomographic scan revealed an acute ischemic lesion in the right parieto-occipital area. Our case shows that an air embolism is a possible complication of artificial intraoperative pneumoperitoneum after pulmonary resection.
