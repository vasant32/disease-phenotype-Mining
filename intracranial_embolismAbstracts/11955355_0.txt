OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dangerous anastomasis between the external carotid artery and the intracranial arteries. METHODS: Angiograms of the external carotid artery in 250 cases were analyzed, including 35 cases of moyamoya and 215 cases of head and neck lesions. RESULTS: The 35 cases of moyamoya, 14 middle meningeal arteries (MMA) were found to participate in the blood supply of the brain. In addition, 11 superficial temporal arteries and 7 occipital arteries supplied the brain. All the cases with ligated external carotid artery (ECA) had the pharyngo-occipital anastomasis. Moreover, the ophthalmic arteries in three cases were found to originate from the MMA. CONCLUSIONS: The external carotid artery has a variety of anastomasis with the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the vertebral artery. Under such circumstances, special measures must be taken to circumvent inadvertent intracranial embolization.
