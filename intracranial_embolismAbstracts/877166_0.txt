Pathogenetic, diagnostic, and therapeutic problems and questions associated with ruptured cerebral aneurysms assume good knowledge of hemostatic processes. The three factors affecting hemostasia, namely, vasoactive, coagulative, and fibrinolytic risk factors in the blood, cerebro--spinal fluid, and at the site of damage to the vessel wall, are discussed withparticular reference to a thrombosing aneurysm. In the case of secondary hemorrhages it is necessary to determine the cause or pathogenesis, respectively, of the disturbance of coagulation or increase in fibrinolysis in order to be able to take suitable therapeutic measures and reduce the risk of secondary bleeding occurring within the first critical weeks after aneurysmal rupture.
