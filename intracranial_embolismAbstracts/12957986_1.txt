Case Report: An 82-year-old women presented with altered mental status, seizure, and apnea after an accidental ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. Ingestion of concentrated peroxide can result in gas embolism of the cerebral vasculature. After hyperbaric treatment, the patient had prompt and full neurologic recovery. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of reversal of significant altered mental status associated with hydrogen peroxide ingestion in temporal relation with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the dangers of peroxide ingestion and may wish to consider hyperbaric oxygen as a potential additional treatment for severe cases.
