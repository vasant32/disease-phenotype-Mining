The number of surgically treated patients with aneurysms included 14 aneurysms located in the Paraophthalmica segment of the A. carotis interna. In six patients only indirect methods (wrapping, establishment of an extra-cranial-intracranial microanastomosis) were used. Clipping of the aneurysmal neck with resection of the aneurysm was reached in six patients. In each case the Processus clinoideus anterior was milled off and the aneurysmal neck was prepared in a sufficient manner for the establishment of the clipping. Intraoperative problems with rupture of the aneurysm and the requirement of definite clipping of the A. carotis interna occurred in two patients. Both patients survived the intervention. One death occurred, it was a young man with a primarily inconspicuous postoperative course and the death was caused by a thrombosis in the carrier vessel.
