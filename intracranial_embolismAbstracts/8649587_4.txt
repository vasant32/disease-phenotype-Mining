We describe a postpartum 30-year-old woman who developed headaches, hypertension, and speech disturbances after bromocriptine treatment to suppress lactation. Brain MRI revealed intraparenchymal hematomas, and an angiographic study showed multiple arterial segmental narrowings compatible with postpartum cerebral angiopathy. We also comment on other cases of postpartum cerebral angiopathy.
