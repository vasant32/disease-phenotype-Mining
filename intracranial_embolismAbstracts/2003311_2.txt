We describe a patient with inherited plasminogen deficiency who developed extensive cerebral venous thrombosis. Several other conditions that might have contributed to a hypercoagulable state, including mild thrombocytosis, thyrotoxicosis, and a chronic inflammatory lung disorder, were present. We also discuss the evidence linking plasminogen deficiency with a thrombophilic state. The diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis in this case was readily established by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, a technique that is ideally suited for the evaluation and follow-up of patients with this condition.
