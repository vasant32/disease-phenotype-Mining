Thromboembolic brain ischemia was produced in dogs using an autologous blood clot model. The effect of postembolic treatment with flunarizine and streptokinase on hemispheric cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction ratio (OER), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied by positron emission tomography (oxygen-15 technique) 24 hours after the insult. We studied five groups of experimental dogs and compared them with a control group of nonembolized dogs. Group I received no treatment, Group II was treated locally with 500,000 IU streptokinase starting 30 minutes after the insult, Group III received streptokinase locally 30 minutes after the insult and 0.1 mg/kg i.v. flunarizine immediately after the insult and 2 hours later, Group IV received flunarizine as Group III, and Group V was orally pretreated with 0.5 mg/kg/day flunarizine during 2 weeks preceding embolization. Compared with the contralateral hemisphere, in the embolized hemisphere a significant reduction of CMRO2 (-25% to -40%) and CBF in normocapnia (-35%) and hypercapnia (-50%) was observed in Groups I, II, and V. In Groups III and IV, CMRO2, OER, and CBF of the embolized hemisphere were within the normal range during normocapnia and hypercapnia; the extent of the ischemic lesions was markedly less than in the other groups of experimental dogs. We conclude that flunarizine treatment after experimental thromboembolic stroke had a favorable influence on brain tissue. Chronic preventive flunarizine treatment failed to have a beneficial effect.
