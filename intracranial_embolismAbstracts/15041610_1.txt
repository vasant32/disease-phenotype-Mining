We present the case of a 57-yr-old patient who suffered an unexplained cerebrovascular event 3 days after being struck by a motor vehicle. Workup demonstrated a previously unknown patient foramen ovale. The etiologies of paradoxical embolism in trauma are discussed. IMPLICATIONS: Paradoxical embolism after multiple traumas is described. Delay in diagnosis may occur given the need for near continuous sedation in the patient with injuries undergoing multiple surgeries and diagnostic tests.
