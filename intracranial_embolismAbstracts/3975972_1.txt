To study the long-term prognosis of stroke, we performed annual follow-up examinations on 306 patients who had survived cerebrovascular accidents. All patients had been admitted to the Neurology Service, First Teaching Hospital, Beijing Medical College from January 1, 1976, to December 31, 1978, and were followed up for 1 to 4 years. The series included 217 cases of cerebral thrombosis, 54 of cerebral hemorrhage, and 35 of TIA. The life-table method was used to determine the cumulative survival rate (CSR), cumulative marked improvement rate (CMIR), and cumulative recurrence rate (CRR), for each of these three types of stroke. The main results were the following: 1. The prognosis was not significantly influenced by sex, BP level on admission, or type of cerebrovascular accident. 2. Age was an important prognostic factor. The survival rate decreased significantly in each successive age group. However, age was not a risk factor for recurrence or poor improvement. 3. The cumulative survival rate, cumulative marked improvement rate, and cumulative recurrence rate did not differ significantly among cerebral thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage, and TIA.
