Of nine patients who have had triple valve replacements for organic rheumatic triple valve disease two died in the postoperative period from inadequate myocardial reserve, and a third died four months later from cerebral embolism originating from clot on the left atrial wall. The remainder are well and, except for one, leading normal lives. Though cardiac transplantation has been recommended and used successfully for triple valve disease by Cooley, it is suggested that the long-term outlook today of triple valve replacement is likely to be better than that of transplantation.
