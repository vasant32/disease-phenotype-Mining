Management of highly vascular carotid body tumors can involve pre-operative percutaneous embolization before definitive surgical resection. This step reduces tumor size, reduces operative blood loss, and makes for a less hazardous dissection with the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of a recently described technique of interrupting vascular supply via covered stent placement in the external carotid artery is further described in a series of three recent cases. This technique may be useful for large tumors with a primary blood supply from the external carotid since it avoids the intracranial embolic risk of coils used for this purpose.
