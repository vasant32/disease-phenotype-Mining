Neurological complications occur in approximately 30% of all patients with infective endocarditis and represent a major factor associated with an increased mortality rate. Third of these complications is represented by cerebral embolism, followed by mycotic aneurysm, meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Brain abscesses are rare; their localization to the cerebellum is exceptional. A case of cerebellum abscess occurring in a 34-year-old patient with non-operated corrected transposition of the great arteries is reported. Occurrence of this abscess was the first demonstration of undiagnosed infective endocarditis.
