Cerebral protection devices have significantly reduced the incidence of embolic events in patients undergoing carotid stenting.

Here we report a patient with entrapment of a filter device within a carotid stent that required surgical removal. The mechanisms underlying this complication and measures to prevent its occurrence are discussed.
