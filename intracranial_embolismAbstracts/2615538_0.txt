We have reviewed the nuclear resonance NR images in three patients with intracranial venous thrombosis. Tomodensitometric findings are not reliable in intracranial venous thrombosis and cerebral angiography is required for the diagnosis. The usefulness of NR for the investigation of venous disease has been recently demonstrated. Ten patients in whom a diagnosis of intracranial venous thrombosis was made with NR have been reported. Initially, the vacuum signal in the T1 enhanced sequences disappears and the thrombus becomes hypointense in the T2 enhanced sequences. In the following phase, proton relaxation is impaired by methemoglobin production and thrombosis appears as hyperintense in both the T1 and T2 enhanced sequences. During the resolution phase, the vacuum signal in the vascular lumen reappears and the hyperintensity of the thrombus signal becomes attenuated. In our study we have shown the different stages of intracranial venous thrombosis with NR. In addition, we have demonstrated the close relation between these images and the clinical evolution. NR is a useful noninvasive investigation in patients with suspected intracranial venous thrombosis.
