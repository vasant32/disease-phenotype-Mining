Brain scans were abnormal in 2 of 6 patients with cerebral "Moyamoya" disease. The spatial and temporal scan patterns were analogous to those described in conventional cerebral infarction. Cerebral infarction due to emboli resulting from mural thrombi may explain  the uptake of radioisotope. None of the scans was abnormal in 4 adult patients in which the disease was complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage.
