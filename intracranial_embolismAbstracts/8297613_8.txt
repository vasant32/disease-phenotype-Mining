Hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion for aortic arch surgery have been reported, but these procedures are of limited duration, require hazardous and complicated techniques and can cause clamp injury. Continuous retrograde cerebral perfusion (CRCP) is a new and simple technique for the protection of the brain during hypothermic circulatory arrest. We applied CRCP in 26 patients who underwent aortic arch surgery. Continuous retrograde cerebral perfusion was performed with a mean blood flow of 383 +/- 176, range 120-800, ml/min. The mean duration of CRCP was 63 +/- 15, range 32-92, min with the superior vena cava pressure at 15-42 mm Hg. No neurologic deficit was observed in 20 patients (90%) and only minor deficits in 2 out of the 22 cases without severe postoperative complications, allowing evaluation of the effectiveness of CRCP. Four patients had other severe complications, and the effectiveness of the method could not be evaluated. Continuous retrograde cerebral perfusion can be an excellent and safe technique which avoids clamp injury during aortic arch surgery.
