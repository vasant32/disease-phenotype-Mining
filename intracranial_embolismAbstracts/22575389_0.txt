 OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics, evolution and prognosis of patients with infectious endocarditis requiring treatment in the Intensive Care Unit. DESIGN: A prospective, observational cohort study of patients admitted due to infectious endocarditis. SETTING: Nuestra Se√±ora de Candelaria University Hospital, a third - level center with a recruitment population of 493,145. PATIENTS: All patients consecutively diagnosed with infectious endocarditis in our center according to the Duke criteria, between 1 January 2005 and 31 July 2011. STUDY VARIABLES: Demographic data, clinical severity scores, microbiological and echocardiographic data, hospital mortality and complications. RESULTS: Out of 102 patients diagnosed with endocarditis, 38 (37%) were admitted to Intensive Care. Compared with those patients not admitted to the ICU, these subjects suffered more frequent mitral valve alterations (OR= 7.13; 95%CI: 2.12-24; p= 0.002) and cerebral embolism (OR= 3.89; 95%CI: 1.06-14.3; p= 0.041). In turn, mortality was greater (42.1% vs 18.8%, p= 0.011), as was the proportion of emergency surgeries (45.8% vs 5.9%, p<0.001). The identified mortality predictors were Staphylococcus aureus infection (OR= 3.49; 95%CI 1.02-11.93; p=0.046), heart failure (OR=4.18; 95%CI: 1.17-14.94; p=0.028), cerebral embolism (OR= 8.45; 95%CI: 1.89-37.74; p=0.005) and the SAPS II upon admission (OR=1.09; 95%CI: 1.04-1.15; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients with endocarditis require admission to the Intensive Care Unit, presenting a much poorer prognosis. Staphylococcus aureus infection, heart failure, cerebral embolism and SAPS II scores are independent predictors of hospital mortality.
