Possible penetration of a considerable volume of air into the lesser circulation when opening the right auricle of the working heart was shown in experiments in 21 dogs. It resulted in blockade of the blood flow along the lesser circulation with a pronounced hemodynamic disturbance, pulmonary edema and penetration of air into the greater circulation vessels and possible embolisation of the latter. The experimental data have confirmed the role of air embolism of lungs in genesis of some cerebral, cardiac and pulmonary complications after operations on the open heart with the artificial blood circulation.
