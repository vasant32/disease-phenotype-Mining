A 28-year-old woman with a mechanical aortic heart valve experienced an embolic stroke in early pregnancy after her anticoagulation therapy was changed from warfarin to heparin. This occurred despite use of a subcutaneous heparin infusion pump and optimal anticoagulation. Thromboembolism can occur in pregnant patients with mechanical heart valves despite optimal heparin therapy.
