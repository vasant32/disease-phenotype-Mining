A cranial window conforming to the contours of the underlying cerebral cortical surface was implanted successfully in 18 cats. Subsequently the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded inside the sealed cranium and changes in the superficial cortical vasculature were related to measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP), measured extradurally, and to the resulting infarcts. Vascular changes early after MCA occlusion were not predictive of the outcome of the occlusion, except for aggregation of formed elements of the blood in arterioles, which was a bad prognostic sign. Secondary reactive hyperemia was not beneficial; increases of ICP suggested that hyperemia led to increased cerebral edema as well as to swelling.
