Seventeen autopsy cases with occlusion of the circle of Willis were examined clinicopathologically. These patients ranged in age from 8 years to 64 years and consisted of 6 males and 11 females. The following results were obtained. 1. Fresh and massive intracerebral hemorrhage was confirmed in 13 of 17 patients and cerebral infarct in 4 of 17 patients. 2. Among these 13 patients, massive hemorrhage was found in basal ganglia, thalamus and hypothalamus of 9 patients, and in thalamus, cerebral peduncle and midbrain of 4 patients. 3. Rupture of the dilated muscular-type arteries was noted in the thalamus and basal ganglia in 2 of 13 patients. Ruptured arteries with organization of the lumen were found in the old hemorrhagic foci in one of them. 4. Overgrown and dilated arteries, branching off from the circle of Willis, were confirmed in 11 patients. These arteries consisted of "perforating" arteries well developed as collateral circulation. 5. No ruture in these arteries of the subarachnoidal spaces was found in 11 patients. In one of them, a small saccular aneurysm was found. These findings strongly suggest that in patients with occlusion of the circle of Willis intracerebral rupture of overgrown "perforating" arteries as collateral circulation may be the main cause of intracranial hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage due to rupture of the arteries may be repeated.
