The present study evaluated the risk in cardiac patients of rupture of a plaque by a jet stream from the arch cannula. The entire thoracic aorta and cardiac function were routinely monitored by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in 88 adult patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. The changes in the atheromatous plaque in the distal aortic arch were observed before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Of the 88 patients, 13 were found to have preoperative atheromatous plaque at the distal aortic arch and 8 (61.5%) of them suffered plaque rupture caused by jet stream from the arch cannula. Only 1 patient experienced apparent embolic episodes manifesting as cerebral and left leg embolisms; the remaining 7 had no clinical embolic symptoms. In order to prevent atheroembolic events, attention should be paid not only to the ascending aorta, but also to the distal arch and in this regard TEE is useful for detecting atheromatous changes of the aorta.
