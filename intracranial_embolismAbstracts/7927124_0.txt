The case of a 76-year-old diabetic patient with known aortic valve sclerosis is reported. One week after implantation of a permanent pacemaker system (indication: 2nd degree AV-block type Mobitz) he developed fever. Large endocarditic vegetations were found on the aortic and mitral valve (blood cultures: were positive for Staphylococcus aureus). Also from the pacemaker bed Staphylococcus aureus was isolated and an antibiotic treatment including vancomycin was started. Nevertheless the patient developed insufficiencies of both the aortic and mitral valves and became hemodynamically unstable. Due to cerebral embolisms and further deterioration of the patient's overall clinical state the already planned operative replacement of the aortic and mitral valve could not be performed. The patient died because of left ventricular failure after pacemaker infection which was complicated by endocarditis.
