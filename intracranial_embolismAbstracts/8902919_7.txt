Controversies exist concerning factors that contribute to the occurrence of epileptic seizures after stroke. Therefore, we studied prospectively the occurrence of seizures in 322 patients with a first-ever CT-confirmed symptomatic territorial brain infarct involving the cortex. We also studied potential risk factors for seizures, and gave special attention to cortical infarct location. Fifty-four patients developed post-stroke seizures. We distinguished between early- and late-onset seizures, occurring within two weeks following stroke-onset, or later than two weeks, respectively. We found that patients of 65 years or older with a cardioembolic brain infarct involving the middle temporal or post-central gyrus, had an almost eight times increased risk of early-onset seizures, whereas patients with a large brain infarct involving the supramarginal or superior temporal gyrus, had a five times increased risk of late-onset seizures. We conclude that risk factors and epileptogenic cortical areas for post brain infarct seizures can be identified, which however, differ between early- and late-onset seizures. These two seizure types may also differ in terms of seizure mechanism. Our findings may influence the decision on prophylactic treatment with antiepileptic drugs in stroke patients.
