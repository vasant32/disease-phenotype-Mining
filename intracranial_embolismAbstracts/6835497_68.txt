Twenty-five patients with giant (greater than 25 mm in diameter) and 9 patients with large (15 to 25 mm in diameter) aneurysms of the internal carotid artery in the ophthalmic or paraophthalmic region are reviewed. In 23 of these patients the aneurysm was clipped directly. There was 1 death in this group, and none of the survivors had disabling neurological complications outside the visual system. The other 11 patients were treated by a trapping procedure or by either common carotid ligation or internal carotid ligation in the neck. Of the 5 patients treated by internal carotid ligation preceded by an extracranial to intracranial bypass graft, 3 developed embolic complications, which in 1 patient resulted in death. One of the 4 patients treated by ligation of the common carotid artery died 1 year later from a recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage. Of the total group, 18 patients had visual loss preoperatively as a result of aneurysmal compression; in 10 the vision was improved by operation, in 3 it was made worse, and in 2 it was unchanged. In another patient the vision continued to deteriorate slowly after common carotid occlusion, and the other 2 patients died postoperatively before vision could be assessed. The complications in the patients are described and analyzed in detail. Maneuvers found to be of value in the direct approach to these lesions are described. Of these, exposure of the internal carotid artery in the neck for temporary occlusion during clipping and thorough drilling of the anterior clinoid process and unroofing of the optic canal were particularly helpful. The literature on indirect methods of treatment by carotid occlusion with and without bypass graft is reviewed with special reference to the complications and effectiveness of each alternative. Based on this review of the literature and our experience, a treatment scheme is suggested for these aneurysms depending on their mode of presentation.
