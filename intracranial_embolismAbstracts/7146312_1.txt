Sudden neurological deterioration suggesting embolism in a patient with a history of cancer should alert the physician to the possibility of a non-metastatic, and therefore potentially reversible, cause of cerebral embolism before cerebral metastasis is implicated. During a four year period, we have observed eight cases of acute cerebral embolism among 3000 cancer patients seen in a department of medical oncology. Five patients had features post mortem of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and in one, the diagnosis had been made antemortem, but treatment with heparin did not prevent further emboli. Two patients had radiation related carotid vascular disease, and one patient post lymphangiographic embolism. The literature reporting these uncommon causes of cerebral embolism is reviewed. Post-lymphangiographic embolism carries a uniformly good prognosis. In selected cases of post-irradiation cerebral embolism, surgical intervention may prevent a neurological catastrophe. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and mucin embolism are of uncertain aetiology and natural history; long-term survival is uncommon, and treatment does not appear to influence the clinical course or outcome.
