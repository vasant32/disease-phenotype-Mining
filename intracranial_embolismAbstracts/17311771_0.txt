In patients with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta, the risks of cerebral embolism and malperfusion are increased if retrograde aortic perfusion via the femoral artery is used during repair. We describe a surgical technique used for 6 aneurysms of the thoracic descending aorta that were operated on via thoracotomy with cannulation of the ascending aorta and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
