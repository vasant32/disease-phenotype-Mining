Three children presented with acute onset of hemiplegia following an upper respiratory infection. Angiography revealed irregulaities, beading, and slow flow of a peripheral branch of a middle cerebral artery. In addition, one child had narrowing of the cervical segment of the internal carotid artery. An inflammatory arteritis of the cervical internal carotid artery is presumably the site of the formation of cerebral emboli.
