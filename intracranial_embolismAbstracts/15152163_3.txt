We describe a case of carotid artery restenosis following carotid artery stenting for treatment of post-endarterectomy stenosis. The goal is to highlight the risk of recurrent restenosis following endarterectomy. In this case report, we describe the use of cutting balloon therapy as a reasonable alternative to repeat surgical revascularization.
