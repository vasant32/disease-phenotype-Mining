An original vacuum apparatus for diagnosis of air embolism based on Schubert's idea on the appearance of cavities in the brain fixed under lower pressure was constructed and assembled. The apparatus is simple, reliable, and cheap which permits to recommend it for equipment of cardiosurgical centers and section wards. In all cases of the cerebral coma diagnosed clinically postoperation it is expedient to examine the brain in Schubert's apparatus. Most important for the diagnosis of arterial air embolism is the examination of the brain after exposure in Schubert's apparatus by the naked eye and in stereomicroscope which simplifies the method and makes it mobile. After exposure in Schubert's apparatus a histological examination of the brain is only complementary and provides only some details. The diagnosis of arterial air embolism by Schubert's method is still possible 3 weeks after its onset before the death of the patient.
