Cerebral scans were obtained on 30 "stroke" patients first with 99mTc pertechnetate and subsequently with 67Ga citrate. Of the 26 patients with abnormal 99mTc static scans, 17 (65%) showed the same abnormality in gallium citrate scans also. In 4 patients with positive technetium flow studies but negative static scans, no abnormality was seen in the scans obtained after gallium citrate injection. In none of the patients was the relative concentration of radioactivity in the lesion greater in the gallium image than in the technetium image. This study proves the nonspecificity of gallium citrate and thus its inability to differentiate cerebral tumor from cerebral infarction just on the basis of localization of gallium.
