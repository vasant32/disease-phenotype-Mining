Alterations in local CBF (LCBF) were assessed autoradiographically in the rat at several time points following photochemically induced cortical infarction. Cortical infarction of consistent size and location was produced by irradiating the brain with green light through the intact skull for 20 min following the systemic injection of rose bengal. A consistent pattern of altered LCBF was recorded in both ipsilateral and contralateral brain regions over the course of the study. At 30 min, a severely ischemic zone surrounded by regions of cortical hyperemia was apparent. LCBF was also depressed relative to control values in ipsilateral cortical regions remote from the irradiated area, while contralateral cortical structures were mildly hyperemic. By 4 h, the zone of severe ischemia had enlarged and its margins were no longer hyperemic. Ipsilateral cortical and some subcortical structures demonstrated significantly depressed levels of LCBF. At 5 days, LCBF throughout both ipsilateral and contralateral cortices was depressed compared with control values. By 15 days, LCBF had returned to control levels in most brain structures shown histopathologically not to be irreversibly damaged. The temporal sequence and magnitude of these hemodynamic alterations are consistent with findings in clinical studies in which repeated measurements of CBF have been carried out in patients with acute stroke. The ability to produce a cortical infarct that results in a consistent pattern of altered CBF should facilitate the investigation of stroke mechanisms responsible for these hemodynamic abnormalities.
