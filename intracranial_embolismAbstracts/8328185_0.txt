In the period from October 1990 to December 1991, 23 patients with acute ischemic stroke were treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a median of 205 min (range 78-355 min) after symptom onset. In this open pilot study rt-PA was given intravenously after an acute CT scan had not shown acute changes. In 12 patients regional cerebral blood flow was measured intravenously using 99mTc-HMPAO before and within 24 h after thrombolytic therapy. Reperfusion of the ischemic area was obtained in 10 patients. In these patients clinical improvement was greater the shorter the delay from symptom onset to initiation of treatment. Three of the 23 patients died, one of a parenchymatous hematoma, one of a large middle cerebral artery infarct, and one of acute myocardial infarction.
