Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) exerts its physiological activities as that of an organotropic factor for regeneration and can prevent ischemia-induced injuries; however, its effect and mechanism of action under in vivo pathophysiological conditions remains to be determined. Recently, we demonstrated that treatment with human recombinant HGF (hrHGF) attenuated the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) observed after microsphere embolism-induced sustained cerebral ischemia. To see if tight junctional proteins were involved in this attenuation, in the present study, we investigated the effects of HGF on the levels of occludin and zonula occludens (ZO)-1 in cerebrovascular endothelial cells after microsphere embolism. Sustained cerebral ischemia was induced by the injection of 700 microspheres (48 microm diameter) into the right internal carotid artery of rats. hrHGF was injected into the right ventricle of the brain by using an osmotic pump at a dose of 30 microg/7 days per animal. The levels of tight junctional proteins in the endothelial cells were examined by immunohistochemical analysis. Treatment with hrHGF attenuated the decrease in the expression of occludin and ZO-1 proteins in the endothelial cells that occurred after sustained cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, treatment with hrHGF resulted in retention of these tight junctional proteins in fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-albumin-perfused cerebral vessels, which did not leak FITC-albumin in the ipsilateral cortex. These results suggest that HGF-mediated maintenance of the tight junctional proteins in the endothelial cells may be a possible mechanism for the protective effect of HGF against the disruption of the BBB after cerebral ischemia.
