 PURPOSE: This Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational device exempt trial assessed the safety and efficacy of a novel device for external left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion. DESCRIPTION: Delivery tool and implant consisting of connectors imbedded in a compliant, soft silicone applied to the base of the LAA flush with the external wall was assessed. EVALUATION: Patients in this prospective, multicenter trial were undergoing elective, nonendoscopic cardiac operations. A core laboratory independently assessed all intraprocedural and 90-day transesophageal echocardiograms. Sixty patients (37 men), aged 33 to 86 years, enrolled. The mean LAA application time was 27 seconds. Transesophageal echocardiograms at 90 days were available in 54 patients, and no leaks were detected. The residual LAA cavity exceeded 6 mm in 5 patients. One delivery device failed to close, and an adjunctive suture was required to complete LAA exclusion. One patient required adjunct sutures at a small tear site related to manual manipulation after fastener application. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated safety and efficacy of this LAA exclusion device, offering an alternative to manual suturing or staples with or without reinforcement.
