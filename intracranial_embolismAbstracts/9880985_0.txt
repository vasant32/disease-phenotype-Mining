Ischemic cerebro-vascular events are in 15% of cases secondary to a cardiac embolus. The prevalence of echocardiographic anomalies, susceptible of being at the origin of a cerebral embolus may reach 50%. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in the detection of a thrombus of the left atrial appendage, spontaneous echocontrast, intra-aortic atherosclerotic plaque lesion, patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal aneurysm. The high prevalence of these anomalies in a population who presented an ischemic cerebrovascular accident does not suffice to establish a causal relationship between the anomaly and the cerebral event. Further studies seem to be necessary to establish the responsibility of these different anomalies and determine their embolic risk, by defining certain risk factors. Pending the results of such studies, TEE should be indicated more systematically in the case of an ischemic cerebrovascular accident of the young patient without a clinically evident cardiopathy, independently of the results of TTE.
