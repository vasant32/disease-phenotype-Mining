In order to evaluate the occurrence and clinical value of ocular lateropulsion in Wallenberg's syndrome, a prospective study was carried out. Lateropulsion of the horizontal and vertical refixation saccades was a rather regular finding, especially in complete Wallenberg's syndrome. Lateral ocular deviation after elimination of fixation was present in nearly all cases. The tonic lateral vector was always directed to the involved side. It is concluded that ocular lateropulsion is an easily elicited sign with a lateralizing value in lateral bulbar infarction. Further systematic search of ocular lateropulsion in other posterior fossa disorders is needed to determine its topographical significance.
