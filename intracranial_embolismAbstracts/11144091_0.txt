Japanese candidates have been accepted for heart transplantation by the UCLA Medical Center in the US since 1993 due to the lack of donors available from brain-dead patients. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We monitored to patients who underwent such heart transplantation and have been seen at the out-patient clinic at Tokyo Women's Medical University following transplantation. Pre-operative diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathy in all patients. One patient underwent Novacor implantation as a bridge to heart transplant. All patients underwent cardiac echocardiography and cardiac catheterization including intraluminal echography. RESULTS: All patients survived with an actuarial survival curve of 100% at 1 year, 100% at 3 years and 87% at 5 years in 4.15 years of average follow-up. Two patients died due to liver dysfunction and cerebral emboli. The postoperative functional status of patients was New York Heart Association classification I in 8 (100%). Immunosuppressive therapies included triple drug therapy using either cyclosporin or tacrolimus. The incidence of acute rejection (/pt) exceeding grade 3 was 4% within three months, 3.5% in 3-6 months, and no significant rejection episode more than 6 months after transplantation. Posttransplantation coronary artery disease was seen in 2 patients, but no progression was seen after diltiazem therapy. CONCLUSION: Our postoperative follow-up after cardiac transplantation appears to be satisfactory.
