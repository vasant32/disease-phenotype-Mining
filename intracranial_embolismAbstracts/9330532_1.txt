A 65-year-old female presented with visual acuity loss. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a partially thrombosed giant aneurysm on the basilar tip. Cerebral angiography showed the opacified lumen of the aneurysm was 25 x 15 mm with a broad-based neck. Using a transfemoral approach, a microcatheter was guided through the vertebral artery and placed directly into the aneurysm under local anesthesia. Interlocking detachable coils were deposited into the patent portion of the aneurysm, resulting in 95% obliteration of the aneurysm and preservation of the parent artery. No complication was observed during or after surgery. Follow-up angiography 2 months later demonstrated the aneurysm was 95% occluded. No coil compaction was observed. Endovascular coil embolization therapy provides a therapeutic option for management of basilar tip aneurysms.
