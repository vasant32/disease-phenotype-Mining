BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anticoagulation (AC) may improve outcome in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), even when complicated by pretreatment hemorrhagic infarction (HI). The HI characteristics which affect the decision to initiate AC therapy and its outcome are unknown. We reviewed our experience with AC treatment for patients with CVT and HI. METHODS: Retrospective study. RESULTS: Two groups of patients were compared: those who received AC (n = 6) and those who did not (n = 6). Hemorrhage volumes ranged from petechial to large (93 cm3) hematoma with mass effect. Anticoagulated patients received treatment a mean of 11.3 days after symptom onset. Each had exclusively extratemporal HI without midline shift and had stable hemorrhage volumes and clinical status for at least 24 h prior to AC. AC did not increase HI volume or worsen clinical outcome. All 6 non-AC patients had enlarging hematomas. Four of these 6 patients had temporal HI; and two required hematoma resection. CONCLUSIONS: AC therapy was avoided in CVT patients with HI that were located in the temporal lobe, caused midline shift or were enlarging. AC was safely initiated within several days in clinically stable patients with non-temporal-lobe HI of unchanging volume. We suggest that the location and unchanged volume on serial CT may be important factors influencing the safety of AC therapy in patients with CVT and HI.
