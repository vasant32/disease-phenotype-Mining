BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the midterm results of transaortic stent-grafting for distal aortic arch aneurysms or proximal descending aortic aneurysms and the feasibility of this method for thoracic aortic aneurysm repair. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with true distal aortic arch aneurysms or proximal descending thoracic aortic aneurysms were repaired with the stent-graft introduced through the incision on the proximal arch aorta. Follow-up computed tomography was performed every 6 months in 21 surviving patients. The maximum dimension of the excluded aneurysmal space and the maximum aneurysmal diameter were measured and evaluated to determine whether the aneurysmal space decreased or disappeared after this alternative procedure. RESULTS: There was 1 hospital death (4.3%) due to cerebral embolism. Another patient died of pneumonia 1 year after surgery. Twenty-one patients (91%) survived during the follow-up period, but 1 patient (4.3%) suffered from paraplegia. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 62 months (average, 34.3 +/- 15.2). There were no instances of aneurysmal rupture during the follow-up period. Postoperative serial computed tomography scans showed disappearance or significant shrinkage of the excluded aneurysmal space in 20 of 21 patients (95%), except for the one patient with endoluminal leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Transaortic endovascular stent-grafting was an effective alternative approach to treating distal aortic arch aneurysms or proximal descending aortic aneurysms. The excluded aneurysm disappeared or shrunk after successful placement of the stent-graft.
