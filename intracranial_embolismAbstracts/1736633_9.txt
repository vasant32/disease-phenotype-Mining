OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical characteristics, neuroimaging features, and outcome of five patients with post-primary varicella zoster virus infection hemiparesis and to offer a hypothesis to explain the predilection for the involvement of the cerebral vasculature in this condition. DESIGN: Patient series. SETTING: Five patients were treated during a 14-month period in a private pediatric neurology practice in a medium-size southwestern city. INTERVENTIONS: Steroids (two patients) and antiplatelet drugs (two patients). No observed effects of therapy. RESULTS: The onset of the hemiparesis occurred several weeks (mean, 5.4 weeks) following an episode of the chickenpox. Magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive than computed tomography or angiography in demonstrating the area of involvement deep in the cerebral hemispheres. The prognosis was good regardless of the therapy administered, as all patients recovered completely or nearly completely. CONCLUSIONS: Primary varicella zoster virus infection with delayed-onset hemiparesis typically occurs approximately 6 weeks after primary varicella zoster virus infection. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive neuroimaging tool in these children. The prognosis is good, with recovery of function and no recurrences in our patients. The innervation of the carotid artery and the characteristics of the varicella zoster virus itself together provide the local and systemic factors that may trigger the vasculopathy responsible for this syndrome.
