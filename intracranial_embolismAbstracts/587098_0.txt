The influence of oral contraceptive agents on neurologic diseases in not clear. Animal experiments suggest that estrogens lower the seizure threshold whereas gestagens have the opposite effect. In women with epilepsy no change in the pattern of attacks could be observed under oral contraceptives. The inducing effect of hydantions and barbiturates on drug metabolizing enzymes requires the prescription of higher doses of estrogens and gestagens. Otherwise unwanted pregnancy can result, an especially unfavourable event in regard to the teratogenicity of hydantoins and barbiturates and possibly or oral contraceptives, too. An immunosuppressive effect of oral contraceptives - found in animals with EAE--could be favourable in respect to the disturbed immune mechanism of patients with multiple sclerosis and myasthenia. The influence of oral contraceptives on migraine seems to vary. The risk of arterial cerebral thromboembolic disease is increased in women taking oral contraceptives. The correlation to the estrogen content of the drugs remains to be proved.
