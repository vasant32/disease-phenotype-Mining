Aneurysms of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) are rare and imply a variety of treatment modalities. We present a case of an incidental, nonruptured posterior cerebral artery aneurysm, which was successfully occluded by coil embolization after a bypass between the occipital artery and the distal posterior cerebral artery was created. MR imaging in a neurologically normal 26-year-old man, performed in the course of a work-up for nonrelated symptoms, incidentally revealed a partially thrombosed and calcified aneurysm of the left posterior cerebral artery (P2 segment). This was confirmed by angiography. Due to aneurysm configuration and localization in the asymptomatic patient, primary clipping or endovascular occlusion was considered to be too hazardous. Four weeks after successful microvascular connection of the left occipital artery to the distal posterior cerebral artery, the PCA was occluded at the level of the aneurysm with a detachable coil. The patient remained asymptomatic, without visual field defects. The above presented combined microvascular (bypass) and endovascular (coil embolization) treatment with excellent result should be considered as alternative in patients with nonruptured, asymptomatic P2 aneurysms, which are high risk for primary clipping or endovascular occlusion.
