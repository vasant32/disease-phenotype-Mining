The authors report an unusual case of a fat embolism following an isolated lumbar vertebra wedge fracture. A 66-year-old gentleman sustained a lumbar wedge fracture following a fall. During routine mobilisation some days later he collapsed suddenly and became unresponsive. Shortly after, he suffered a fatal cardiac arrest. A post-mortem was performed which attributed the cause of death to fat embolism. Most previously reported cases of fat embolism are associated with long bone fractures and major bony surgery. No apparent case of fatal fat embolism following an isolated vertebral fracture has previously been described.
