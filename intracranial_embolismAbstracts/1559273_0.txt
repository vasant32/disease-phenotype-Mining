The authors present a case of massive systemic air embolism with an unusual X-ray finding which developed during high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV), paradoxically when minimal inflation pressures were used. The air was detected by X-ray not only in the systemic circulation but also intracranially (in the area of the cisterna magna, cerebral sinuses and intraventricularly). They draw attention to the fact that even the application of non-conventional ventilation methods does not rule out the development of this serious complication and they recommend, when this complications is suspected, to examine by X-ray also the cranium. This is the first report in the literature where intracranial embolization developed during HFOV.
