PURPOSE: To present our experience with the use of primary stenting to treat embolic iliac artery occlusions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six patients (5 men; mean age 50.6+/-14.1 years range 37-72) underwent primary stenting for embolic occlusions lodged in the common iliac and/or external iliac arteries and were retrospectively evaluated. The probable reason for the embolism was atrial fibrillation in 4 patients and acute myocardial infarction in 2. In 5 patients, an additional embolus was demonstrated in the renal, mesenteric, popliteal, and middle cerebral arteries. Iliac emboli were treated with primary implantation of self-expanding stents followed by very low-pressure balloon dilation. In all cases, primary stenting was technically successful and provided immediate recanalization with elimination or reduction of symptoms. There was no procedure-related complication. During the mean 11-month follow-up (range 1-18), all stented iliac arteries remained patient. One patient died due to cerebral embolism at 21 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although this experience is limited, excellent midterm results suggest that primary stenting may be a valuable alternative in the treatment of embolic occlusions of the iliac arteries in selected cases.
