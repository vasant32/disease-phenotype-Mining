Whether or not mannitol can prevent infarctions in ischemic brain tissues was investigated utilizing the thalamic infarction model in dogs. Twenty dogs were divided into equal control and mannitol treatment groups. Temporary 4 vessel clipping for 60 minutes was adopted as the standard procedure for both groups. The only difference between the groups was the administration of 2 g/kg of mannitol before the arterial occlusion. In the controls, 6 of 10 dogs showed infarctions verified by histological changes at the seventh post-ischemic day. In the mannitol group only 1 dog in 10 showed infarction. The difference is statistically significant.
