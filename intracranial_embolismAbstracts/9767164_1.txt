The present study was undertaken to elucidate pathophysiological changes in noradrenaline (NA) transporter and Na+/K+-ATPase, key regulators of cation gradient across the plasma membrane, in nerve terminals of the cerebral cortex after microsphere-induced cerebral embolism in rats. The Vmax value of NA uptake, when analyzed by the Eadie-Hofstee plot, tended to decrease on the 1st day and decreased on the 3rd and 7th days after the embolism without any change in the Km value. The NA content in cerebrocortical synaptosomes did not alter on the 1st day, but decreased on the 3rd and 7th days after the embolism. Ouabain (1 mM) inhibited NA uptake on the 1st day, but did not alter the uptake on the 3rd and 7th days after the embolism. The activity of Na+/K+-ATPase of cerebrocortical synaptosomes increased on the 1st day and gradually decreased up to the 7th day after the embolim. These results suggest that NA uptake in nerve terminals of the cerebral cortex decreased after microsphere embolism, which may be due to a reduction in function of NA transporters. The changes in Na+/K+-ATPase following microsphere embolism may represent a compensatory action to maintain ion homeostasis in nerve terminals at an early stage of ischemic injury.
