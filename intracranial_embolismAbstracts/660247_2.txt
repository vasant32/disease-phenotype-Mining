Administration of large amounts of levodopa did not improve survival rates of rats after acute cerebral infarction induced by injection of carbon microspheres. However, when 10% glycerol was used, the number of rats that survived after cerebral infarction was significantly greater than in the control or in the levodopa-treated rats. Combination of levodopa and glycerol therapy also significantly improved the survival rate of beneficial effect. Pathological findings (gross or microscopic) indicate striking changes in brain tissue after embolization. Development of brain edema of the infarcted left hemisphere corresponded to the type of treatment and to the length of animal survival. Brain-tissue histology indicates that glycerol-treated animals developed less severe edema and had less tissue disruption than control animals. The results suggest that treatment of edema should be one of the primary steps in therapy after acute cerebral infarction.
