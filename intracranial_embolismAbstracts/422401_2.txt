A case of mucormycosis in a 45 year-old woman with uncontrolled diabetes is reported. Following dental extractions, the patient presented with total ophthalmoplegia, chemosis and complete sensory loss of the right fifth cranial nerve. Exophthalmus was not present. Although a fungal infection was suspected, administration of Amphotericin B was avoided because of renal insufficiency. After temporary clinical improvement with high doses of antibiotics, signs of right seventh and eighth cranial nerve paralysis and of thrombosis of the right ophthalmic artery developed. The patient expired after six days. Autopsy disclosed extensive mucormycosis with involvement of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, soft tissues and bones of face and orbit, cranial nerves, meninges and base of the brain, as well as mycotic thrombosis of the right cavernous sinus and the internal carotid, ophthalmic and maxillary arteries. The spread of infection is detailed, and the importance of an early diagnosis is stressed.
