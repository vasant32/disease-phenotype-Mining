 BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene A1166C polymorphisms have been inconsistently associated with ischemic stroke risk. We examined these associations by performing a meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a search of articles published from January 2000 to October 2010 using the following keywords: {(angiotensin II type 1 receptor) or (AT1R) or (AGT1R)} and {(stroke) or (cerebral infarction) or (cerebral embolism)}. Eleven studies testing the association between AT1R gene A1166C polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk were included. The analyses were performed using the Review Manger 5.0.25 software package. RESULTS: The combined data showed no association between the AT1R 1166 AC/CC and ischemic stroke risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.34, p = 0.49). In the subgroup analyses, the association was also not significant among the White populations (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.88-1.38, p = 0.39) or the Asian populations (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.56-1.77, p = 0.98). LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity and publication bias existed in this meta-analysis, which might have affected the analysis result. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggests that the AT1R gene A1166C polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to ischemic stroke.
