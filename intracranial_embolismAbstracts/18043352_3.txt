This case study demonstrates the feasibility and diagnostic value of the oblique-plane arterial spin labeling method to visualize individual perfusion territories in a patient with embolic stroke. The perfusion territories obtained with this technique differed significantly from the standard anatomical situation. Imaging findings suggested that all acute embolic lesions in both hemispheres had arisen from one symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis.
