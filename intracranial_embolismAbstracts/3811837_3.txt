Fifty-seven well-defined acute stroke patients were investigated for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of zinc (Zn), total protein, and albumin, as well as 6 patients with old infarctions. Significantly increased concentrations were found in patients with acute non-embolic and embolic infarctions and haemorrhage compared with patients having old infarctions or with the controls. The CSF-Zn concentrations in acute infarctions correlated significantly with the total protein and albumin concentrations of CSF. There was no significant difference in the CSF concentrations between the first and second lumbar puncture. The size of the infarctions on CT scan did not correlate with the CSF parameters. High CSF concentrations of Zn, total protein and albumin in acute infarctions related to a poor short-term prognosis. This study shows that CSF-Zn determinations in acute cerebrovascular diseases may be of diagnostic and prognostic value.
