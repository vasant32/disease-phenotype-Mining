An animal model of acute cerebrovascular thromboembolism was developed to evaluate the feasibility of selective fibrinolysis. In 20 Flemish Giant rabbits, autologous clot was deposited via selected catheterization of the distal end of the common carotid artery. The rates of clot lysis with streptokinase were compared in eight control rabbits and after three different dosage regimens in four rabbits each. Group A received selective infusion of 5000 U/hr; group B received 4000 U/min for 1 hr, 3000 U/min for 2 hr, and 5000 U/hr for 2 hr; and group C was treated similar to group B plus receiving an initial 20,000 U bolus of streptokinase. Lysis was evaluated by serial angiograms obtained hourly for up to 6 hr after the clot was deposited. Five proximal vessels arising from the common carotid artery were chosen for the angiographic grading system. The control group showed beginning lysis after 5-6 hr. Group A appeared to show a slight improvement about 4 hr after clotting. Group B demonstrated an early and greater improvement at 2 hr that appeared to be sustained throughout the experiment. Group C showed no difference compared with the control group. The Dunnet t procedure and the Kruskel-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance were used for comparing the angiograms of the treatment groups with those of the control group at corresponding study times. The results of these animal experiments do not indicate a definite benefit of streptokinase treatment alone over no treatment. Further controlled studies are needed before the value of streptokinase in routine clinical practice can be determined.
