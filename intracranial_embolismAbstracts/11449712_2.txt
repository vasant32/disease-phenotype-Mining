A 71-year-old female was admitted with the complaints of dysarthria and right hemiparesis. CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left cerebral sulcus. The first angiography was performed 3 days after the onset and left carotid angiography revealed a small aneurysm arising from the left middle cerebral artery. After 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy, the second angiography showed the aneurysm to be clearly enlarged, so it was resected. The patient complained of marked dysarthria a day after the operation and CT scan revealed a new infarction in the right frontal lobe. The third angiography showed an aneurysm arising from the right middle cerebral artery and the fact that two peripheral arteries of the aneurysm had disappeared 3 weeks after the first operation. The second operation was performed and a bacterial aneurysm was resected. The patient left the hospital without any neurological deficits. Septic embolism is the most important complication of infective endocarditis and it is usually presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage caused by ruptured bacterial aneurysms. In this case the septic embolism occurred two times. At each time cerebral ischemic attacks were presented. The reason why this case presented with ischemic symptoms was suspected to be that embolisms occurred at the trifurcation of the distal middle cerebral arteries. We were able to detect a bacterial aneurysm angiographically 3 days after the ischemic attack and we suspected that a bacterial aneurysm had been able to develop within 3 days after the septic embolism.
