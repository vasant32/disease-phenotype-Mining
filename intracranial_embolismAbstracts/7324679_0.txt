A 56-year-old male patient showed numerous episodes of transitory disturbances of the cerebral circulation for  a period of 12 years. The disturbances were localized in the left hemisphere. At operation a large and partially thrombosed aneurysm was discovered in the cervical division of the internal carotid artery. The aneurysm was discovered in the cervical division of the internal carotid artery. The aneurym was excised, and the artery ligated. For 10 years after the operation the patient has been showing no cerebral circulation disturbances. This observation shows that the transitory cerebral circulation disturbances may be caused by periodic embolism of the median cerebral artery by thrombotic aggregates getting from an aneurysm in the cervical division of the internal carotid artery.
