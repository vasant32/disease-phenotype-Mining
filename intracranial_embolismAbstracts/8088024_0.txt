To investigate risk factors for embolization in patients with echocardiographically detected left atrial thrombi and to evaluate thrombus development, we examined 29 patients with transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography at two points during a follow-up of 18 months. We compared patients with a history of possible arterial embolization (n = 13) with those without (n = 16) in regard to age, gender, left atrial dilatation, localization of the thrombus in the left atrial cavity, spontaneous echo contrast, and atrial fibrillation. Eight patients were treated with aspirin, 20 with phenprocoumon. Only left atrial spontaneous contrast was associated with thromboembolism (10/15 patients with spontaneous contrast experienced arterial embolism; p = 0.038). In six patients arterial embolism occurred after thrombus detection (14% per patient per year). Four of these patients were treated with phenprocoumon, two with aspirin. At reexamination, one thrombus was detected in the patient without anticoagulant treatment and one thrombus was detected in the 8 patients treated with aspirin (13%), compared with ten thrombi detected in the 20 patients (50%) treated with phenprocoumon (p = NS). In 17 patients no thrombus was seen at reexamination. Since only 2 patients had undergone thrombectomy and 3 experienced arterial embolism during follow-up, thrombi disappeared under medical therapy in 12 patients. Patients with left atrial thrombi have a high risk of arterial embolization despite proper anticoagulative or antiplatelet treatment. Embolization occurs significantly more often if spontaneous echo contrast can be visualized. Left atrial thrombi can be reduced in size by the administration of antiplatelet and anticoagulative agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
