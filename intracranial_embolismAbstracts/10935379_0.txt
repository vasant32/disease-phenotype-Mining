During recent 8 years, combined procedures of valve surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were performed in fifty-five patients at Omiya Medical Center. AVR (31 cases), MVR (12 cases), MVP (8 cases), DVR (1 case), TVR (1 case), TAP (2 cases) were performed with the average of 2.0 bypass graftings in this series. Five patients died due to organ ischemia (3 cases), cerebral embolism and heart failure. Organ ischemia occurred in dialysis patients and the results of combined surgery in dialysis patients were unsatisfactory (3/5 cases, mortality rate is 60%). On the other hand, the results of combined surgery in non-dialysis patient is reasonable (2/50 cases, mortality rate is 4%). Before the combined surgery in dialysis patient, careful analysis of surgical risk including organ ischemia is needed and avoiding the prolonged perfusion time is important to achieve a successful surgical result.
