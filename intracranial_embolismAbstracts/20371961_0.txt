The clinical symptoms of Takayasu's arteritis (TA), which mainly affects the aorta and major aortic branches, vary widely depending on the site and degree of arterial lesions. We present herein the case of a young man whose initial symptom was pulmonary artery occlusion and who manifested TA 6 years later as cerebral embolism. Angiography confirmed bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and a well-developed collateral circulation. The stump of the occluded CCA has both proximal and distal ends. The possibility of emboli from the occluded CCA (distal stump) seems to be the most probable explanation, as turbulent flow was detected at distal stump on color Doppler sonography. The carotid stump can be a potential source of emboli in TA as well as in atherosclerosis.
