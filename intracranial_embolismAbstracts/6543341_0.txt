Causes of the death of four animals from the total of eight were technical failures (diaphragm perforations, disconnection of the quick-connector, and a failure of the supply of electric current which could not be prevented). Causes of the death of the remaining four animals were embolisation in the brain stem, embolisation in the superior mesenteric artery leading to diffuse peritonitis, ruptures of aorta and hemocoagulation disorder causing fatal gastrointestinal bleeding.
