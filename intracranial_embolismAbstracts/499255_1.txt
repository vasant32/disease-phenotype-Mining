The case of a 2 1/2-year-old girl with a well-nigh asymptomatic neuroblastoma of the left adrenal is described. In the final stage it gave rise to unusual clinical signs. The tumor had grown into the inferior vena cava via the left suprarenal and renal veins. Dissolution of the soft tumor mass in the vena cava caused fatal massive embolism of lungs and brain.
