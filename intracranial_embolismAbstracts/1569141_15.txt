The purpose of this study was the development of a model of embolic stroke with high reproducibility concerning infarct volume. In 37 male Sprague-Dawley rats, the internal carotid artery was embolized with in vitro preformed suspensions of autologous microemboli resembling arterial thrombi. With a method of continuous flow through the carotid arterial catheter, reflux of blood with uncontrolled clotting and embolization was avoided, thereby providing control animals free of ischemic damage. The embolized animals had arterial occlusions on angiograms immediately after embolization and no spontaneous recanalization on angiograms 2 h later. The cerebral blood flow measured by the intra-arterial 133Xe injection method decreased to 21-37% of baseline values. All embolized animals developed hemiparesis with spontaneous circling behavior, embolization with more than 150 microliters clot suspension resulted in hemispherical infarcts. There was a strong statistically significant correlation between amount of emboli, rate of vascular occlusion, and volume of infarcted tissue. This is the first model presented utilizing autologous in vitro microemboli imitating "white" arterial thrombi. The animals developed infarction, resembling human stroke.
