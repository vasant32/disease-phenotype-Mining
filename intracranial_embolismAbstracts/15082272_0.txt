OBJECTIVES: Although endovascular stent-grafting is available for atherosclerotic thoracic aneurysms, it is unknown whether the excluded thrombosed aneurysms shrink. We evaluated serial changes in distal aortic arch or proximal descending aortic aneurysms excluded space after transaortic stent-grafting. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with true distal aortic arch or proximal descending thoracic aortic aneurysms were treated by stent-grafts introduced via proximal arch aortic incisions. Follow-up included computed tomographs (CT) every 6 months in 31 patients. The maximum dimensions for excluded space and aneurysmal diameters were measured and evaluated to determine whether the aneurysmal space had decreased or shrunken following this alternative procedure. RESULTS: Two hospital deaths (5.9%) were caused by a cerebral embolism and a peri-operative myocardial infarction. Another case died from pneumonia a year after surgery. Thirty-one cases (91%) survived during follow-up, but one case suffered from paraplegia (2.9%). The follow-up period ranged from 10 to 72 months (average 39.3+/-27.2 months). There were no aneurysmal ruptures during follow-up. Post-operative serial CTs showed a disappearance or a significant shrinkage of the excluded aneurysmal space in 30 of the 31 cases (97%); one case suffered endoluminal leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Transaortic endovascular stent-grafting is feasible for distal aortic arch or proximal descending aortic aneurysms. The excluded aneurysmal space disappears or shrinks after successful stent-graft placement.
