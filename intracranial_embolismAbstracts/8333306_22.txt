Twelve patients with severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) underwent intraventricular thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). External ventricular drainage was performed in all patients within 24 hours of haemorrhage. Fibrinolytic therapy was started within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms in ten cases, and in two further cases after 48 hours and 5 days, respectively. Two to 5 mg of rtPA were injected via the ventricular catheter into one or both lateral ventricles. The injection was repeated at intervals ranging from 6 to 24 hours until CT scans demonstrated a substantial reduction of intraventricular blood. The total rtPA doses per patient ranged from 3 to 31 mg. CT scans showed a marked reduction of intraventricular blood and normalization of ventricular size within 24 to 48 hours from the beginning of the fibrinolytic therapy. Rapid reduction of elevated intracranial pressure by continuous diversion of cerebrospinal fluid could be achieved in all patients, because the ventricular catheters never became obstructed by clotted blood during the fibrinolytic therapy. During the period of treatment, the level of consciousness, as classified according to the Glasgow Coma Scale, improved from a mean value of 7 to 12. One fatal case of meningitis most probably due to the ventriculostomy was the only complication related to the treatment. This method of treatment might improve the prognosis in patients in whom a large intraventricular haematoma volume, ventricular dilatation, and impaired cerebrospinal fluid circulation are major determinants for the outcome.
