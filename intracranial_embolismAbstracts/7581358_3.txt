Watershed infarction has previously been described after cerebral trauma, when it is due to raised intracranial pressure or systemic hypotension. A case is reported, so far as is known for the first time, of bilateral watershed infarction following blunt systemic trauma, without injury to the head or neck. The importance of resuscitation in preventing secondary brain injury caused by systemic hypotension is highlighted. The advantages of HMPAO-SPET in detecting cerebral perfusion defects are discussed.
