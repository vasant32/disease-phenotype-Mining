Embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate (IBCA) is an alternative to surgical treatment when dealing with large AVMs with multiple arterial feeders. The deposition of IBCA in the nidus of the AVM may produce an active and progressive thrombosis that may lead to complete occlusion of the nidus and/or to progressive thrombosis of the draining veins. Four clinical examples of progressive thrombosis after IBCA embolization are demonstrated, including two cases in which late follow-up angiography showed complete obliteration of a partly embolized AVM.
