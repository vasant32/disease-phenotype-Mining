Advances in imageology have improved the diagnostic yield of cerebral venous/sinus thrombosis (CVT). However, its management remains a challenge. The present study was carried out to study the role of heparin in CVT. Therapeutic outcome of 150 patients of puerperal CVT manifesting within one month of delivery or abortion, was analyzed. The diagnosis was supported by cranial computed tomography and/or angiography whenever required. Seventy three patients, 46 with non-haemorrhagic infarction and 27 with haemorrhagic infarction, received 2500 units of subcutaneous heparin, three times a day within 24 hours of hospitalization till 30th post partum day or symptomatic relief. Seventy seven patients during the same period, 50 with non-haemorrhagic infarction and 27 with haemorrhagic infarction, who did not receive heparin formed the control group. Repeat CT scans were done when indicated. Among the heparin group, 34 patients made full recovery. There were eight deaths, all among the patients with haemorrhagic lesion. In control group, only 14 patients recovered completely (P=<0.001) and 18 died (P=<0.001). There were no adverse effects of heparin. Low dose heparin is safe and efficacious in puerperal CVT, even in patients with haemorrhagic infarction.
