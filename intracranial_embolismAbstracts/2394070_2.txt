We report a patient who presented acutely to a neurosurgical unit with a mild left hemiparesis following mild trauma and an episode of hypotension. Computed tomography of the brain showed fresh partial thrombosis of a right parietal arteriovenous malformation. Subsequent angiography confirmed partial obliteration of an arteriovenous malformation. The malformation had completely thrombosed on follow up computed tomography, and disappeared angiographically.
