Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is a disease of unknown origin. It was first described by Davies in Uganda in 1948. The clinical enchocardiographic, and hemodynamic findings in 18 patients are presented. Six patients had right-sided involvement, four had left-sided involvement and eight had biventricular involvement. The presence of a small ventricle with obliteration of the apex and a large atrium, diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography, is highly suggestive of endomyocardial fibrosis. Ventricular angiography was diagnostic in 17 out of 18 cases. Endomyocardial biopsy yielded positive findings in three out of seven patients and is not essential for diagnosis. Two patients suffered a cerebral embolism. Six patients underwent surgery with good results in three patients.
