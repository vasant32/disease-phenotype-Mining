Endocardial lesions are caused not only by inflammatory processes but also by myocardial ischemia, resulting in endocardial thrombosis and cerebral embolism. We deviced a method for direct visualization of endocardial damages by a novel dye image cardioscopy with Evans blue and examined its feasibility in patients with heart disease. The dye was injected into the left ventricle before and after endomyocardial biopsy. Endocardial surface was stained in dark blue in 63% of patients with angina pectoris before biopsy. After biopsy, the biopsied portions were stained in blue in all. The results indicate that endocardium is damaged even in apparently intact LV in patients with ischemic heart disease and that endomyocardial biopsy causes severe endocardial damages.
