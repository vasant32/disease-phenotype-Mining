A case of air embolism to the brain occurred via a disconnected central venous catheter. Computed tomography disclosed a number of small air bubbles in the right hemisphere. If the clinician suspects air embolism a CT scan should be obtained immediately to verify the presence of intracerebral air. On later CT scans only secondary effects like in any embolism will be seen.
