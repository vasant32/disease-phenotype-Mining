During the last two years oral contraceptives containing gestodene were suspected to cause cerebrovascular disorders. 52 cases with adverse neurological side effects were registered up to October 31, 1990. Anonymous protocols received from the Companies Schering AG and Wyeth Pharma were analyzed from a clinical point of view. There are different arterial and venous, thrombotic and embolic disorders caused by different pathogenetic principles. Only one third of the cases was documented by neuro-imaging to render possible actual diagnostic reliability. Suspected cases represent a great number of different cerebrovascular disorders usually observed in neurological and neurosurgical series, concerning both men and women, OC-users and non users.
