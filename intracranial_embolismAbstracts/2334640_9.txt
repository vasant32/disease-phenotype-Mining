Previously described platelet-aggregating antibodies associated with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia required heparin for their in vivo and in vitro expression. We have observed a patient with thrombosis who became thrombocytopenic during heparin treatment, but who suffered further thrombotic events and continued thrombocytopenia for 3 months after heparin withdrawal. The patient's plasma contained a potent platelet aggregating factor reactive with both his own and normal platelets in the absence of heparin. It also caused [14C]serotonin secretion from labelled platelets from normal donors and patients with either Glanzmann's thrombasthenia or Bernard-Soulier syndrome. This factor was an IgG and was neutralized by antibody specific for IgG lambda light chains. While the patient was thrombocytopenic an IgG paraprotein with lambda light chains was detected by isoelectrofocussing. After corticosteroid treatment it disappeared and the patient recovered. The active, but not the recovery serum contained IgG which immunoprecipitated a glycoprotein with characteristics of Glycoprotein IV from platelets labelled with Na[3H]BH4/periodate. Thus platelet-aggregating IgG antibodies with direct specificity for platelet surface glycoproteins may be associated with thrombosis/thrombocytopenia.
