Papillary fibroelastoma is one of the commonest benign tumor in the heart. In almost all of cases, symptoms never develop and the tumors are usually discovered coincidentally. Even though papillary fibroelastoma is a benign tumor, surgical extirpation is usually indicated for reason of productive serious complications. The tumors may cause left ventricular outflow obstruction, cerebral embolic infarction, myocardial infarction and even sudden death. The case we reported here is unusual case, because the patient developed symptoms and complaints such as palpitation, feverish and general fatigue. We measured tumor markers, interleukin 6, serotonin and histamine, but none of those was elevated in the blood samples. Surgical removal of the tumor attached to the base of posterior papillary muscle was carried out without causing mitral incompetence, and the pathological findings were compatible with papillary fibroelastoma. After the operation, the both symptoms and complaints disappeared unexpectedly.
