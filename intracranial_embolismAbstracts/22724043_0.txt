Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are a rare form of benign, primary cardiac tumor. They tend to develop from the valvular endocardium, with nonvalvular locations being uncommon. They are primarily found on either the mitral or aortic valve. They account for 7% of all primary cardiac tumors. Papillary fibroelastomas are usually identified through either transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography. The latter is more likely to provide a clearer diagnosis. Management remains controversial. The benign histology notwithstanding, the prevailing consensus is toward excision of left-sided cardiac lesions due to the risk of coronary and cerebral embolization. While the diagnosis of cardiac papillary fibroelastomas is relatively rare, the likelihood of encountering a right-sided lesion with rapid growth in a 6-month period is extraordinary. We highlight a case where an 84-year-old man with coronary artery disease was found to have a right atrial mass attached to the tricuspid valve. This mass grew by more than 1 cm in a 6-month period.
