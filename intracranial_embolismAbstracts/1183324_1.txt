Between 1965 and 1974 ten patients were operared on for cardiac myxoma. There was a striking variety of signs and symptoms caused by tumour embolization, haemodynamic obstruction, and auto-immunological reactions. The diagnosis should be made early before the occurrence of irreversible complications, especially cerebral embolism. Echocardiography is a simple technique for the detection of atrial myxoma but a negative result does not exclude it, and diagnosis has to be confirmed by angiocardiography. The tumour should be removed as soon as possible after diagnosis. There is danger of tumour embolization in the course of operation. Operative mortality is low in patients with only haemodynamic complications, but in patients with previous cerebral embolism the risk is higher because of possible bleeding in the infarcted areas of the brain resulting from anticoagulation during cardio-pulmonary bypass. Nonetheless, the operation is indicated in all cases. If removal of the myxoma is complete, recurrence is rate and long-term results are good.
