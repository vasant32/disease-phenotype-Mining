BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have revealed that liposuction causes systemic fat mobilization. However, the degree of the risk it causes is not clear. In this study we investigated the risk of systemic fat mobilization and fat embolus in rats following liposuction using dry and tumescent techniques. METHODS: At the end of the procedures, the rats were sacrificed and specimens were obtained from the lungs, kidneys, liver, brain, and skin. Histological examinations of the specimens were carried out. Liposuction was not performed in the control group (n = 8), but blood and tissue specimens for histological examinations were obtained. RESULTS: We found signs of fat embolus in both blood specimens and histological examinations of tissue samples in the study groups. However, the results of the examinations were normal in the control group. Although there were no fat particles in the blood before liposuction, blood specimens obtained following the procedures and in the long-term had fat particles.
