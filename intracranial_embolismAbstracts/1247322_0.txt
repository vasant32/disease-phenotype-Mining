Dogs subjected to a thoracotomy in which a rib-spreading retractor was employed developed filling defects in the cerebral microcirculation attributable to obstruction by microemboli. These changes were not observed in control groups and could be prevented in the experimental group by pretreatment with RA233, a platelet inhibitor. It is possible that microembolic-related complications of operations and trauma, such as pulmonary insufficiency, might be ameliorated by the use of platelet inhibitors.
