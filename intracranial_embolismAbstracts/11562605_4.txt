We report a case of survival following a temporary cerebral air embolism, which occurred immediately after CT guided lung needle marking. A 24-year-old man was referred to our hospital for resection of a pulmonary nodule. To localize the tumor, lung needle marking under CT guidance was performed. Almost immediately, the patient experienced symptoms of cerebral arterial air embolism. The following day, the symptoms diminished, and a brain CT showed no abnormal lesions. A video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection was performed as scheduled, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged in relatively good condition.
