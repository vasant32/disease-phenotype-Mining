Because peripartal cardiac disease occurs infrequently, its manifestations may be unfamiliar to most physicians. We report two unusual cases of postpartum cardiac disease: one patient presented with cerebral and peripheral arterial embolization, and the second patient developed late eclamptic seizures with subsequent myocardial infarction. Both patients recovered. Nonobstetric physicians should be aware of these pregnancy-associated medical complications to allow prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapy.
