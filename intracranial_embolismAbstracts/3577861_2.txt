Traumatic aneurysms of the cerebral arteries of penetrating origin are rare but a well recognized entity and their development in military practice have not been adequately discribed. In the review of the literature we encountered only 24 cases of traumatic aneurysms after penetrating brain wounds. In view of their rarity, we are adding four new cases. The need for routine angiography in the evaluation of the vascular state in penetrating brain wounds as well as the necessity of their prompt surgical intervention is emphasized.
