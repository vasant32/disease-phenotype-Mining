BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A major concern during carotid artery stent placement is the potential for cerebral embolism. Diminishing the number of device manipulations across the lesion might reduce procedural stroke risk. For this purpose, we report our initial experience with carotid stent placement without the use of either balloon angioplasty or distal protection devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients with 100 carotid stenoses compose this series. Ninety four of the 100 hundred stented carotid arteries were either symptomatic (58 [58%]) or had a greater than 70% stenosis (36 [36%]). Six percent of them were asymptomatic and had stenosis between 50% and 70%. Patients underwent neurologic evaluation before the procedure and during follow-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter. Carotid sonography and plain films of the neck were performed immediately after the procedure and then at the same time intervals. RESULTS: Primary stent placement was successful in 98 of 100 case subjects. In 2 case subjects, predilation was necessary before stent deployment. Neurologic periprocedural complications included 1 nondisabling and 1 disabling stroke and 5 transient ischemic attacks. The mean duration of follow-up was 23 months (range: 10-36 months). During the follow-up period, there were 5 deaths, all unrelated to the carotid disease, and no major stroke. The degree of stenosis decreased from a mean of 78.85% before the procedure to a mean of 21.23% immediately after. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, carotid stent placement without the use of either balloon angioplasty or distal protection devices was safe and effective with a low incidence of periprocedural complications.
