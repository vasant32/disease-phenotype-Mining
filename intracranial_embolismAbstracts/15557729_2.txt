We report the case of a 61-year-old man with a stroke secondary to cerebral embolism resulting from inadvertent malposition of a permanent transvenous pacemaker lead in the left ventricle. An electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were suggestive of a left-sided positioned lead which was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography. Because this malposition was complicated with a cerebrovascular event, transcatheter lead extraction was planned, however, the patient chose lifelong anticoagulation therapy.
