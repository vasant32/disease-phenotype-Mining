BACKGROUND: There are many options for proximal anastomosis during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the efficacies of these procedures have not been well clarified. Therefore, we examined the clinical impact of our strategy to modify the proximal anastomosis procedure for aortic atherosclerosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 535 consecutive patients undergoing off-pump CABG between 2004 and 2007. The patients were divided into three groups depending upon the type of proximal anastomosis procedure: 241 patients with normal or mild atherosclerosis underwent partial clamping (clamp group), 81 patients with moderate atherosclerosis underwent the procedure with Heartstring (Guidant Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA), 28 patients underwent with Enclose II (Novare Surgical Systems, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) (device group), and 185 patients underwent the procedure without clamping, including six with severe atherosclerosis (no-touch group). RESULTS: There were seven in-hospital mortalities (1.3%) and five strokes (0.9%). There was no difference in the mortality rate (clamp, 1.2%; device, 1.8%; no-touch, 1.1%; p = 0.42) or stroke rate (clamp, 0.8%; device, 2.8%; no-touch, 0.5%; p = 0.09) among the three groups. Graft patency was similar regardless of the method (clamp, 94.7%; Heartstring, 96.7%; Enclosed II, 96.0%; p = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Our strategy to modify the proximal anastomosis procedure resulted in a low stroke rate. Aortic clamping could be performed safely in patients with normal or mild atherosclerotic aorta. In patients with moderate atherosclerosis, the result of an anastomotic device may need a further investigation.
