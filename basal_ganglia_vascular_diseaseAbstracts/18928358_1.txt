OBJECT: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is used as a hemostatic agent in many neurosurgery centers. The authors used a 3% H2O2 solution for final hemostasis after removal of a left insular tumor. Immediately afterward, air bubbles were observed within the lumen of the polar temporal artery. Postoperative MR imaging revealed punctate areas of infarction in the lenticulostriate artery territory. The authors designed an experimental study to elucidate the mechanism of remote O2 emboli and reactive O2 species-related vasoactive responses and thrombus formation. METHODS: In this study, H2O2 irrigation was used in mice with either an intact pial layer or after the pia mater was removed through a corticotomy. Normal saline irrigation was used in the corresponding control groups. Vessels were examined for intravascular O2 emboli under the microscope. Tissue sections were then obtained and stained with H & E and the 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) antibody to evaluate intravascular thrombus formation and peroxynitrite reaction, respectively. RESULTS: Multiple bubbles were observed within the lumen of the vessels after exposure to H2O2 regardless of whether the pial layer was destroyed or intact. Immunofluorescent staining for 3-NT showed an abundant positive reaction in the vessel walls of all animals exposed to H2O2 as well as vascular occlusion with acute thrombus formation. Samples taken from the animals that received saline showed no positive staining for 3-NT and no vascular occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to H2O2 may cause serious ischemic complications. The formation of peroxynitrite may cause vasoactive responses to H2O2 and platelet aggregation/thrombus formation, and the free diffusion of H2O2 through the vessel walls and its conversion to water and O2 leads to O2 bubbles within the closed vessel lumen. If used intradurally, H2O2 may have deleterious ischemic effects, and it can only be used carefully in open extradural spaces.
