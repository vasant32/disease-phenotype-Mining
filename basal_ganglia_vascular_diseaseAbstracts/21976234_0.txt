Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), basal ganglia hematoma (BGH) and ischemic stroke are common diseases with diverging therapies. The simultaneous occurrence of these diseases is rare and complicates the therapy. We report the case of a 30-year-old man with a ruptured lenticulostriate artery after traumatic brain injury that caused the combination of SAH, BGH and ischemic stroke and subsequent cerebral vasospasm. This rupture mimicked the pathophysiology and imaging appearance of aneurysmal SAH. The site of rupture was not secured by any treatment; however, hyperdynamic therapy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were feasible in this setting to prevent additional delayed neurological deficit.
