PURPOSE: To investigate, through an immunohistochemical method, whether there is deposition of plasma proteins in the wall of lenticulostriate, cortical and leptomeningeal arteries of hypertensive patients, with and without lipohyalinosis. METHOD: Forty patients with essential hypertension were selected at random, 20 with lipohyalinosis in the lenticulostriate arteries (HH group) and 20 without lipohyalinosis (H group), matched with 20 normotensive controls (C group). RESULTS: Plasma protein deposits were identified in eight patients (40%) in the C group, in 15 patients (75%) in the H group, and in all 20 patients (100%) in the HH group, the difference being significant for the H group and highly significant for the HH group, as compared with the C group. In all groups, the distribution of plasma protein deposits, subendothelial in normal arteries, and diffuse, irregular in the wall of arteries with lipohyalinosis, was more frequent in the lenticulostriate arteries of the putamen. CONCLUSION: Deposition of plasma proteins in the lenticulostriate arteries seems to be relatively frequent in normotensive individuals, starting in middle age. Such process appears to be intensified by hypertension, especially in individuals with lipohyalinosis.
