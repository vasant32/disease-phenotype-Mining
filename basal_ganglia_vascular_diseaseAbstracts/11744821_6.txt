Few studies have assessed the frequency of familial clustering in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Of 144 patients with ICH prospectively assessed, 14 (9.8%) had a positive family history of ICH (FH+). Four pedigrees had more than two affected family members. Comparisons between FH+ and FH- probands demonstrated no significant differences in race, age, sex, ICH type or location. An underlying genetic etiology may account for familial clustering in some ICH patients.
