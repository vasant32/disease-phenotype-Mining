BACKGROUND: Advances in diagnostic testing and surgical techniques have resulted in reduced mortality in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) and a major concern for neurological morbidity in the presence of preoperative neurological injury. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and nature of preoperative cerebral ultrasound abnormalities in neonates with major CHD and to examine the relationship between cerebral abnormalities and the type of CHD. METHODS: Retrospective study; inclusion criteria: (1) neonates with major CHD admitted to the NICU over a 3-y period, (2) gestational age >35 wk, (3) documented preoperative cranial ultrasound available; exclusion criteria: (1) small for gestational age, (2) other congenital anomalies and/or chromosomal abnormalities, (3) a 5-min Apgar score <7, (4) congenital infection. Cranial ultrasounds (CUS) were reviewed without knowledge of the cardiac defect. CHDs were categorized. RESULTS: Fifty of 108 neonates with CHD met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one patients (42%) had abnormalities on CUS. Thirteen of these (26%) had widened ventricular and/or subarachnoid spaces, three (6%) lenticulostriate vasculopathy, one (2%) calcification in the basal nuclei, and four (8%) had acute ischaemic changes. Cerebral abnormalities occurred more frequently in patients with coarctation or hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) than transposition of the great arteries (TGA) (63% vs 14%; n.s.). CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of preoperative cerebral ultrasound abnormalities in this group of neonates with major CHD.
