Four patients with a stroke developed micrographia. In two patients, the condition was pure and in the two other patients it was associated with signs of writer's cramp. We conclude that infarct of the left lenticular nucleus could either mimic pure micrographia similar to that of Parkinson's disease or micrographia associated with dystonia.
