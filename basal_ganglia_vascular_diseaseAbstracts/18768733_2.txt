We report a case of diffuse arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in basal ganglia and an internal capsule associated with venous aneurysms. The patient was treated by embolization guided by CT angiography to target the basal ganglionic portion of the AVM while sparing the internal capsule. Our case demonstrates that it is possible to obtain good quality intranidal angiograms by using CT angiography, which can be useful for exact localization of the catheterized part of the nidus.
