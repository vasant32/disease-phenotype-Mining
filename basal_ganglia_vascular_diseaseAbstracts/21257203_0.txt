Aneurysms arising from the lenticulostriate artery (LSA) are rare. So far, only 23 cases have been reported in the literature (Ahn et al. 2007 [1], Gandhi et al. 2008 [2], Harreld et al. 2010 [3]). Early detection and treatment of these aneurysms is difficult because of their small size, deep location and complex surrounding vasculature. The majority of reported cases were treated surgically, and only two were treated with endovascular embolization (Harreld et al. 2010 [3], Larrazabal et al. 2001 [4]). We present here a case of an LSA aneurysm that was successfully embolized with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) with no recurrence after 1 year of follow-up.
