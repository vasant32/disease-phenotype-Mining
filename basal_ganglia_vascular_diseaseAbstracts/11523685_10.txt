OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Hemorrhage associated with central neurocytoma has been described previously, but never in association with an aneurysm originating from a feeding artery. We present the first reported case of a central neurocytoma in a patient with intraventricular hemorrhage caused by rupture of an aneurysm on a lenticulostriate artery that supplied the tumor. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old man who presented with an intraventricular hemorrhage underwent magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography that disclosed a right lateral intraventricular mass and a 7-mm fusiform aneurysm from a lateral lenticulostriate branch of the right middle cerebral artery. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent a contralateral transcallosal exploration and resection of the tumor, with excision of the adjacent lenticulostriate artery aneurysm. Pathological review demonstrated that the tumor was a neurocytoma. The aneurysm was discrete from the tumor but occurred on a vessel that supplied the tumor. CONCLUSION: Previous reports have demonstrated that intraventricular neurocytoma may present with tumor hemorrhage. In this case, an aneurysm separate and distinct from the tumor was the bleeding culprit, and the aneurysm was on an artery that fed into the tumor. Any such aneurysm must be identified and treated appropriately for therapy to be complete.
