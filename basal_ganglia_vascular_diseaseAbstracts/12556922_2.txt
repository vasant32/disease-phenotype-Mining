OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, possible etiologies, and neurodevelopmental outcome of premature infants (<35 weeks) with isolated lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV). STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective case-control design, we reviewed the medical records of all premature infants who were admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit between 1996 and 2000. RESULTS: The prevalence of LSV was 4.6% (21 of 453). Patients with late LSV (detected after 10 days of age) had less exposure than controls to prenatal steroids [42.8% (6 of 14) vs. 92.8% (13 of 14), respectively; p<0.01], and prenatal antibiotics [42.8% (6 of 14) vs. 85.7% (12 of 14), respectively; p=0.01]. Fifty-seven percent (8 of 14) of patients with late LSV had a low Apgar score vs. 14.2% (2 of 14) of the control group (p=0.01). Patients with LSV also had more muscle tone abnormalities than controls at 6 months of age [33.3% (5 of 15) vs. 5.2% (1 of 19), respectively; p=0.03]. CONCLUSION: Patients with late LSV have less exposure to antenatal steroids and antibiotics, lower Apgar scores, and abnormal muscle tone at 6 months of age.
