Current consensus on the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in the form of exposure and response prevention (ERP). However, the generalizability of these methods to elderly populations remains largely undocumented. This clinical case study examines the effectiveness of medications and intensive, inpatient ERP in an elderly patient with onset of OCD following basal ganglia infarcts. There was a dramatic reduction from baseline to follow-up in both obsessions and compulsions with Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [YBOCS; Goodman et al., 1989] total scores decreasing by over 20 points. These gains were maintained up to 1 year post-treatment. Age-specific issues and the application of standard therapeutic methods to elderly clients are discussed.
