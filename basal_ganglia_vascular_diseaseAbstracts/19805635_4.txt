Hypertension, a major risk factor for stroke, is associated with altered arterial anatomy and function; however, the limited resolution of current imaging techniques has restricted the in vivo study of microvascular changes in the brain. In this report, we quantitatively examined the lenticulostriate arteries in hypertensive patients using ultrahigh-field 7T MRI. We compared the number of stems and branches, curvature, and tortuosity of the lenticulostriate arteries by 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography among 20 hypertensive patients (mean age: 46.6+/-9.1 years) and 20 age-matched healthy subjects (mean age: 47.7+/-8.1 years). The average numbers of stems and branches in hypertensive patients were significantly less than those of healthy subjects (P<0.002). However, this difference was abolished in older volunteers (>45 years old), whereas the difference between young hypertensive patients (< or = 45 years old) and age-matched healthy controls was augmented by 55% for stems and 91% for branches (P=0.001). In comparison, there were no differences in the average curvature and tortuosity of the lenticulostriate arteries and no significant difference when corrected for smoking (P=0.064). In conclusion, our results showed that there was a substantial difference in the lenticulostriate arteries of hypertensive patients compared with healthy individuals when observed in vivo by ultrahigh-resolution 7T magnetic resonance angiography, and the difference was considerable in young subjects.
