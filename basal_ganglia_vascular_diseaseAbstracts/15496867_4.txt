OBJECTIVE: To determine the antenatal risk factors associated with neonatal lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV). STUDY DESIGN: Women in preterm labor were randomized to magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), other tocolytic, or saline control. The surviving babies underwent head ultrasounds (HUS) (weeks of life 1, 2, and 4) and periodic developmental examinations (months 4, 8, 12, and 18). RESULTS: Of 140 infants, 17.1% (24) had neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and 10.0% (14) had LSV (half of the latter (7 of 14) had both IVH and LSV). In a regression model in which other risk factors were controlled for, the association between antenatal exposures to tocolytic MgSO4 >or=50 g and LSV were significant (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 8.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5 to 45.0; p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Based on our data and their analyses, we infer that antenatal exposure to high-dosage, tocolytic MgSO4 may be associated with LSV.
