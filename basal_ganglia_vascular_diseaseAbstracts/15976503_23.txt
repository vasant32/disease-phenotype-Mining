BACKGROUND: Cell transplantation is safe in animal models and enhances recovery from stroke in rats. METHODS: We studied the safety and feasibility of fetal porcine transplantation in 5 patients with basal ganglia infarcts and stable neurological deficits. To prevent rejection, cells were pretreated with an anti-MHC1 antibody and no immunosuppressive drugs were given to the patients. RESULTS: The first 3 patients had no adverse cell, procedure, or imaging-defined effects. The fourth patient had temporary worsening of motor deficits 3 weeks after transplantation, and the fifth patient developed seizures 1 week after transplantation. MRI in both patients demonstrated areas of enhancement remote from the transplant site, which resolved on subsequent imaging. Two patients showed improvement in speech, language, and/or motor impairments over several months and persisted at 4 years. The study was terminated by the FDA after the inclusion of 5 patients. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the transplantation of nontumor cells in ischemic stroke patients.
