We report the first instance of restless legs syndrome (RLS) associated with periodic limb movements (PLM) and disruption of sleep architecture occurring in a patient following ischemic infarction in the right lenticulostriate region. Recently, a role for the basal ganglia-brainstem system in the control of motor behaviors and in the regulation of awake-sleep states has been proposed. The purported roles of these structures may be relevant in explaining the occurrence of the RLS in our patient. The discrete brain localization observed in this patient may be a clue to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of RLS and PLM.
