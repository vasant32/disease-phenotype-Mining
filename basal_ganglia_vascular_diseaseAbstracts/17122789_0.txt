Intracranial pathology is a common and important complication in extremely low birth weight babies. Lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV) is an abnormal finding on cranial ultrasounds of sick babies and has been associated with congenital infection, chromosomal aberration and twin-to-twin transfusion. We describe a previously unreported situation of LSV being detected in both donor and recipient twin. This pair of monochorionic, diamniotic twins was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at 28 weeks of gestation. The mother underwent an emergency caesarean section because ultrasound and Doppler studies showed stage III twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The first twin weighed 998 g and second twin weighed 600 g. The first twin had an uneventful stay, whereas the second twin needed prolonged continuous positive airway pressure and indomethacin for patent ductus arteriosus. Both of them developed LSV. The clinical significance of this condition on the neuro-developmental outcome of a neonate has not yet been fully determined.
