We present the case of an 11-year-old male who had a dissection of his left internal carotid artery following a rather innocuous mechanism of injury. Although this phenomenon is documented in the medical literature, it remains a relatively rare event following blunt injury to the head and neck (0.3% occurrence rate in 1 study spanning 7 years). (Despite its rarity, it remains an important cause of cerebrovascular accidents in children. 2) Children presenting with gross neurologic abnormalities following blunt trauma to the head or neck should be considered to have sustained injury to the carotid arteries until proven otherwise.
