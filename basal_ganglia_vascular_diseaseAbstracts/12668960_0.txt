Cerebral blood flow (ml/min/100g) (CBF) was detected by two methods, static xenon inhalation dynamic CT (Xe-CT) and perfusion CT, and a comparison of these two methods (Xe-CBF and perfusion CBF) was carried out in the same cases. Xe CT used 30% static xenon, 4 min wash-in, and 5 min wash-out, while perfusion CT was done by injecting 30 ml of non-ionic contrast medium at a rate of 9 ml/sec. Forty-eight patients underwent these examinations (30 serious cases and 18 mild). The correlation coefficients in the hemispheric area were r=0.713 (p<0.01) with Xe-CBF and perfusion CBF in mild cases and r=0.567 (p<0.01) in serious cases. The two CBF values were especially disparate in serious cases. The value for perfusion CBF was almost double that of Xe-CBF in these cases. Perfusion CT was a useful examination for the detection of CBF, but in serious cases, CBF needs to be determined by Xe-CT as well.
