Emotional facial palsy (EFP) is a rare condition in which facial paresis is only apparent during reflex movements of the hemiface, such as smiling and laughter. We report the case of a 32-year-old man presenting with EFP as the main symptom of a small striatocapsular infarction. Our case strongly suggests that the anterior arm of the internal capsule is part of the corticonuclear tract that is involved in emotional facial motility.
