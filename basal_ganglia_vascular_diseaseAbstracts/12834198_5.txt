BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The association between hypertension, diabetes, and worse cognitive function has been reported to be stronger in groups with low levels of education. Using data from a cross-sectional community survey of Korean elders, we sought to investigate this within a sample with relative cognitive impairment. METHODS: The sample consisted of 341 participants with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Korean version) scores of 24/30 or below. Previous diagnoses were ascertained and participants were examined for resting blood pressure and nonfasting blood glucose and cholesterol. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, occupation, physical dependence, and cholesterol levels, worse cognitive function (MMSE score <21) within the sample was associated with raised systolic blood pressure, raised glucose levels, and a previous diagnosis of diabetes. These associations were significant only in participants with no formal education. In this group the adjusted odds ratios for worse cognitive function were 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.34) for each 10 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and 3.47 (1.14-10.6) for a previous diagnosis of diabetes. Odds ratios for the group with previous education were 0.99 (0.81-1.21) and 1.82 (0.48-6.92), respectively. CONCLUSION: The association between risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment appears to be particularly strong in people with lower educational attainment.
