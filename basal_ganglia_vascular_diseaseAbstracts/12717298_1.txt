The authors report four cases of aneurysm of the lenticulostriate arteries, three idiopathic and one with underlying MoyaMoya disease. This unusual pathology, which often affects young patients, is revealed by a meningeal syndrome and sometimes focal neurological signs. The bleeding is highlighted by a CT scan without contrast injection, even by MRI, these examinations making it possible to evaluate its repercussion. Arteriography or MRA show the aneurysm and eliminate vascular malformation. According to literature (15 cases published) and our experience, considering the difficulty of a surgical or endovascular approach, morbidity and the frequency of spontaneous thromboses, it seems that a conservative management is justified after a negative etiologic check-up and under radio-clinical monitoring.
