Matrix metalloproteinases may play a role in tissue remodelling and destruction associated with inflammation. We investigated activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases in a rat model of colitis and tested the therapeutic potential of a synthetic inhibitor (CGS-27023-A). Colitis was induced by dextran sulphate sodium (at 5% in drinking water for 5 days) in a group of eight rats, whereas a matched control group received plain water. Activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases were measured in colonic tissue homogenates using zymography and Western blot on days 3 and 5 after induction of colitis. In another set of experiments, two groups of colitic rats (20 per group) were treated with CGS-27023-A (20 mg/kg) or vehicle, respectively. On days 5 and 14, colonic mucosal lesions were blindly scored by microscopic examination. Induction of colitis led to a significant upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 protein and its activity, but no change in matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity was observed. Treatment with CGS-27023-A significantly decreased the extent and severity of epithelial injury but did not influence mucosal repair. We conclude that increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases may contribute to epithelial damage in this model of colitis.
