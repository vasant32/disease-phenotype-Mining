<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients who were treated at the ENT University Hospital Graz between 2005 and 2010 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 11.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were experiencing symptoms for 9.8 days on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, neck stiffness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, otalgia, postauricular pain, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sixth nerve palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The otoscopic findings were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography with contrast enhancement was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was possible to detect the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with computed tomographic scans after contrast administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An additional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient was treated completely conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients underwent surgical treatment consisting of mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional thrombectomy was performed in 3 patients, and ligation of the internal jugular vein was performed in 2 of these 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were administered intravenous antibiotics and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no complications related to the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were treated without thrombectomy or ligation of the internal jugular vein and in the patient with complete conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Otogenic sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a rare complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Early treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics combined with simple mastoidectomy is the standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">Anticoagulants</z:chebi> represent a safe treatment option if they are administered correctly </plain></SENT>
