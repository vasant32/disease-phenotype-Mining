<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the preoperative diagnosis of venous invasion is important, as it will alter the surgical approach to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive means of visualizing the cerebral venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preoperative diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> can, however, be difficult and confusing with conventional spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging because of variable appearances produced by blood clot degradation products as well as flowing blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phase magnetic resonance imaging is a simple method that can be acquired simultaneously with conventional spin-echo sequences, and is based primarily on whether protons are stationary or moving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the context of venous sinus occlusion, phase imaging can demonstrate the presence or absence of blood flow more easily than spin-echo imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three cases of dural-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are presented that demonstrate the utility of phase imaging in diagnosing tumoral occlusion of the venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
