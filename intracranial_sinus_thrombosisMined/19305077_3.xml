<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the usefulness of D-dimer in the diagnosis of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 26 patients with CVST were subjected to a detailed medical history and neurological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cranial MRI was carried out on a 1.5T scanner using T1, T2, and DWI sequences and two-dimensional time of flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>D-dimer was estimated using a rapid latex agglutination slide test using monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of patients ranged between 16 and 70 years old (median 31 years old); 8 were males and were examined after a mean duration of 22 days of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was attributed to puerperium in 4 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 5 patients, and pregnancy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>, insect bite, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in 1 patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Superior sagittal sinus was involved in 15 patients, transverse sinus in 16 patients, straight sinus in 3 patients, sigmoid sinus in 7 patients, and cavernous and deep system in 1 patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 patients had more than one sinus involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>D-dimer was positive in 20 patients and correlated with the duration of symptoms but not with the extent of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: D-dimer is useful in patients suspected of CVST and patients with positive test results should be urgently sent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
