<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a patient who had a superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in addition to his PDPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signs and symptoms of intracranial pathology in patients with dural puncture <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, in addition to their postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old man with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He developed postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> after a diagnostic lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed superior sagittal sinus (SSS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and meningeal enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An epidural blood patch was performed and enoxaparin was prescribed for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He has remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PDPH have classic postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of additional signs and symptoms should alert the clinician to the presence of intracranial pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had treatment with L-asparaginase and steroid are predisposed to the development of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and may have this syndrome in addition to a dural puncture <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
