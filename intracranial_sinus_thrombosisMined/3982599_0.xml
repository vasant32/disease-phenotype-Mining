<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the right parietal region, which had lower density than usual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and was associated with irregular perifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms revealed narrowed cortical vein with irregular wall in the right parietal region, where delayed local blood flow into the deep cerebral veins through collateral vessels was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of cortical vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To reduce intracranial pressure, evacuation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> which existed 1cm under the right parietal cortex was about 20g in weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She remarkably improved soon after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequency of sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has been reported to be about 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral ischemic diseases, however, localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is rare among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is because it is not always symptomatic and it is difficult to make accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six cases of localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were reviewed, in which accurate diagnosis were established by cerebral angiograms, CT scan and/or autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiological features of this case were presented </plain></SENT>
