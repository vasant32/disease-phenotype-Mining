<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were randomized into three groups, namely control (n=6), embolism (n=26) and sham-operated (n=26) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the embolism group, a self-made plastic graft was inserted in the superior sagittal sinus of each rat during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each plastic graft had a total length of 0.4 cm, its conical anterior segment had the largest diameter of 0.12 cm and its posterior segment became gradually thin and flat with a width of 0.2 cm and length of 0.1cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both the embolism and the sham-operation groups, the rat brains were resected at 6h, 1, 3, and 5 days post-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gross observation and water content of samples were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for caspase 3, Bcl-2 and Bax were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the embolism group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> reached a peak level at 6h after surgery and then gradually recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant elevated positive rates of caspase 3, Bcl-2 and Bax after embolism operation were observed, reaching peaks at 1 day time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Yet, Bcl-2/Bax decrease significantly during the follow-up, indicating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction in embolism operation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The new rat CVST model made by inserting a solid graft into the superior sagittal sinus is reproducible and reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> plays a crucial role during the development of CVST pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
