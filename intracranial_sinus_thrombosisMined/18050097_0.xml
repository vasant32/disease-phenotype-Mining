<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVSTs) constitutes an infrequent location of the venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by diverse factors, although up to 35% of the CVSTs can remain without aetiologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Coagulation disorders</z:e> have been involved in up to 75% of the CVSTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To describe the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> in a consecutive series of CVSTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective revision of the clinical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CVST admitted in our service between January, 1st 1995 and December, 31st 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The thrombophilic study was carried out a posteriori in whatever individual who lacked it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied twenty-one cases (7 men and 14 women), within an age range of 16-69 years old (corresponding to an average of 35,4 +/- 14,4 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The thrombophilic study was carried out in eighteen patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five (27,7%) presented some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary coagulation disorder</z:e>; in four of them, a hormonal cause coexisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recent advances in the diagnostic procedures for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> and hereditary prothrombotic mutations have enabled the specialists to be more precise in the aetiologic diagnosis of suspected CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even so, the apparent cause for a high percentage of patients with CVST has not been found yet </plain></SENT>
