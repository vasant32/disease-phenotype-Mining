<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 35-year-old woman using oral contraception was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> epidural infiltration for L5 radiculalgia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following day a postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> developed and accidental dural puncture was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four days later, she presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and consciousness impairment requiring mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was observed three weeks later and the patient fully recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> showed a moderate decrease in the C protein level (chronometric activity 44%, N = 65-130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CVT has been reported after spinal anaesthesia or peridural anaesthesia with accidental puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After dural puncture the decrease of cerebrospinal fluid pressure induces a rostrocaudal sagging effect with traumatic damage to the fragile venous endothelial wall, and may trigger a venous vasodilatation with resultant stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CVT has also been described in patients after lumbar puncture and oral corticoid treatment for multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> intrathecal infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> can be considered as a potential additional procoagulant stimuli </plain></SENT>
