<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no literature on the long-term neuropsychological and emotional sequelae and implications for quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 17 children who had CVST after the neonatal period, aged between 1 month and 16 years at the time of CVST (mean age at CVST was 6 years, median 4 years 8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five children died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was related to CVST in one child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve children participated in a clinical follow-up assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 2 years 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One child had physical sequelae with impairment of skilled movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had average or high intelligence scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two children with CVST due to an uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>: one child had difficulty with written language; the other had diminished cognitive efficiency with concentration and attention problems associated with decreased psychosocial functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreased physical well-being was reported in three of 12 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that children who had survived CVST had a fair prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive and physical development, although mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> or decreased physical and psychosocial well-being can occur </plain></SENT>
