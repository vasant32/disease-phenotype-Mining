<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LST may appear in children as a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo>, but nowadays it is more frequently encountered in adults with long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the pediatric patients with LST between 1982 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen cases of LST were diagnosed and treated by our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six cases, LST was due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> and in the remaining cases it was due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, aural discharge and mastoid tenderness were the most frequent findings in these patients and four patients were initially diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the majority of the patients, LST was accompanied with other intracranial complications, such as perisinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0750960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multiple brain abscesses</z:e>, unresponsive to several drainage procedures, died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other patients recovered and have since been followed-up as out-patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LST may be difficult to diagnose due to previous antibiotic treatment and to the overlap of clinical findings with other entities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite the value of modern imaging techniques in the investigation of the disease, a high index of suspicion based on the clinical picture is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with those of other recent studies, who found that mortality of LST has dropped below 10% </plain></SENT>
