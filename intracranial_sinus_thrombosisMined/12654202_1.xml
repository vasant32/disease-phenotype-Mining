<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To summarize the experience of treating the obliteration of the cerebral venous sinus in 17 patients by using direct thrombolysis and stent angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and stenosis of the venous sinus were confirmed by digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 3 patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a single sinus and 14 had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in multiple sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The circulating time was prolonged for over 13 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The micro-catheter was preserved in the sinus for 5 days, followed by infusion of urokinase 1.5 million units and oral <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> 3-5 mg each day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stent angioplasty was done for 4 patients with obvious stenosis of the venous sinus detected by DSA after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After contact <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and stent angioplasty in sinuses of the 17 patients, remarkable recanalization of obliterated sinuses was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> pressure (ICP) returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 7 patients, and 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> relapsed in different degree after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation was prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients showed the ICP above 280 mm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No obvious relapse was found in 15 patients during the follow-up for 3-60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that successive thrombolysis and stent angioplasty for occlusion and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the venous sinus are effective in promoting drainage of cerebral venous blood and rapidly decreasing ICP </plain></SENT>
