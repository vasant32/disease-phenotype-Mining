<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A few cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) were reported after a lumbar puncture (LP), suggesting a causal association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to document that LP might predispose to CVT by decreasing blood flow velocities (BFV) in veins or dural sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a transcranial Doppler ultrasound study to register the mean BFV of the straight sinus (SS) before, during and after LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LP induced a decrease of 47% of mean BFV in the SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean decrease of BFV was significant immediately at the end (p = 0.003), 30 min after (p = 0.015) and more than 6 h after LP (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LP induced a sustained decrease of mean BFV in the SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease of venous blood flow is a possible mechanism contributing to the occurrence of CVT </plain></SENT>
