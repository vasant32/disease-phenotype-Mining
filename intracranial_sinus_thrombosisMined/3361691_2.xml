<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out to ascertain the effects caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the coronary venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The coronary sinus (CS) of 21 adult mongrel dogs was abruptly obstructed to produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These dogs were then tested for serial changes of ECG, coronary arterial blood flow (CBF), left ventricular pressure (LVP), serum enzymes originating from the injured myocardium and histological changes of myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the clinical application of a new coronary venography procedure was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained in these experiments were as follows; (1) When the CS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was produced by the abrupt obstruction of the sinus, ECG patterns and serum enzymes originating from the myocardium showed changes similar to those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) The histological examinations showed that the changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were characteristically similar to those of hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) Despite the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> of the coronary-venous system by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or obstruction was not observed on the coronary-arterial side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is probably due to the recirculation of blood flow through the Thebesian vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(4) The experiment confirmed that the clear coronary venograms were easily obtained, without any risk, by the fixation of a balloon-tipped catheter inside the CS </plain></SENT>
