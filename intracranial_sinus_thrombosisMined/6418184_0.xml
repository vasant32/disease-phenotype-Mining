<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cured case of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 26-year-old man, also displayed severe complications such as hemorrhagic infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although his prognosis was considered to be extremely poor, conservative treatment, with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, steroid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi>, etc. was effective, and he was discharged without any neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report discusses the clinical course, CT findings, angiographical findings and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At first, CT showed no abnormal findings, but hemorrhagic infarction was detected on the 3rd day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT showed subcortical low density area, hemorrhagic infarction with perifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, midline shift etc; the focus of hemorrhagic infarction was almost absorbed 2.5 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiogram showed not only the obstruction of the superior sagittal sinus but also that of cortical veins of cerebral convexity at first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiogram showed the development of collateral circulations such as deep cerebral, ophthalmic and emissary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On CBF study, low rCBF at the bilateral parasagittal region was observed, but marked increase of rCBF was measured in the parasagittal region, especially at the site of hemorrhagic infarction after the administration of 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, consider <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> as an effective agent for the treatment of cerebral sino-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
