<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When "conventional" therapy including <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and neuro-intensive care failed to reverse the progressive neurological deterioration or to control the ICP, the condition was approached surgically and thrombotic material was removed from the dural sinuses without much difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect on the ICP was dramatic, although short-lived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second operation, combined with local infusion of streptokinase in the sagittal sinus, had a permanent effect as judged from the ICP measurements, radiological findings, and clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of direct operative removal of thrombotic material and local infusion of a thrombolytic agent (streptokinase) proved to be an effective treatment of severe dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in this patient </plain></SENT>
