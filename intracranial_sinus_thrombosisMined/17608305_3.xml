<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the accuracy of these codes for identifying childhood sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective search of admissions records for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, Indiana, from January 1999 to June 2005 using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes 325 (cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, excluding nonpyogenic cases and cases associated with pregnancy and the puerperium), 437.6 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of nonpyogenic origin), and 671.5 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in pregnancy or the puerperium) in any position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this period, there were 47042 admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 325 identified 61 admissions on 56 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 13% were of pyogenic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two (92.9%) had "possible, probable, or definite" sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but only 76.9% of those had "probable or definite" sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Uncertainty in diagnoses stemmed from limitations in imaging and disagreement over interpretation of imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 325 in the primary position identified 7 children; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had possible (n = 1), probable (n = 1), or definite (n = 5) sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 437.6 identified a single admission on a single case of probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>; it was unclear whether this case was "nonpyogenic." <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 671.5 did not identify any children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 325 is useful for identifying children likely to have sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but it is not useful for differentiating pyogenic and nonpyogenic cases, and uncertainty in clinical diagnosis makes it difficult to gauge the true accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is important to search for the code in any position as limiting searches to the primary position misses most cases </plain></SENT>
