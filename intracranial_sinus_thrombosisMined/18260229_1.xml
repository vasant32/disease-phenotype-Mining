<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of antibiotics has lead to decrease in the complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> as well as the mortality of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to review our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrospective clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a retrospective study of 70 children with extracranial and intracranial complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> who were treated in the period from 1968 to 2006 at Department of Otolaryngology, Medical University of Gdansk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their treatment has been documented with long period of otologic follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extracranial complications occurred in 41 (30.4%) of treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> cases, and subperiostal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> was the commonest one in 37 (90.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial complications occurred in 29 (21.4%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> cases and facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> was the commonest one in 14 (40.0%) cases, followed by sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and perisinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ear cultures grew in patients with otogenic complications, the most often Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy with myringotomy resolved the disease in 46 (65.7%) children, only myringotomy in 6 (8.6%) and canal wall down mastoidectomy in 18 (25.7%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete resolution was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The persistent othorrea, otalgia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, prolonged high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, neurological signs were the most common symptoms associated with the development of intracranial complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and MRI are necessary tools for diagnosis and surgery planning in every case of latent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> does not prevent otogenic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Extracranial or intracranial complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> need surgical treatment and prolonged antibiotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The present study found evidence for decreased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> and their suppurative complications during last years </plain></SENT>
