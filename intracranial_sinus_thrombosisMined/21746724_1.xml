<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Newborns frequently incur positional occipital bone compression of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that SSS compression is associated with neonatal CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our retrospective case-control study recruited neonates with CSVT (SickKids Children's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program, January 1992-December 2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were neonates without CSVT undergoing magnetic resonance or computed tomography venography (institutional imaging database, 2002-2005) who were matched 2 per each case patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blinded neuroimaging review by 2 experts quantified SSS compression and head position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effect of SSS compression on the primary outcome of CSVT was determined (logistic regression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary analyses included the relationship of head position to SSS compression (t test) and group comparisons (cases versus controls, cases with and without compression) for demographic, clinical, and CSVT factors (χ² and Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Case (n = 55) and control (n = 90) patients had similar ages and delivery modes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SSS compression was common (cases: 43%; controls: 41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Controlling for gender and head position, SSS compression was associated with CSVT (odds ratio: 2.5 [95% confidence interval: 1.07-5.67]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compression was associated with greater mean (SD) angle toward head flexion (101.2 [15.0] vs 111.5 [9.7]; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among CSVT cases, neonates with and without compression had comparable gestational age, delivery mode, risk factors, anticoagulation treatment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> location, propagation, infarction, recanalization, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Many idiopathic cases had SSS compression (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interrater reliability of compression measurements was high (κ = 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal SSS compression is common, quantifiable, and associated with CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Optimizing head position and/or developing devices to alleviate mechanical SSS compression may represent a novel means to improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
