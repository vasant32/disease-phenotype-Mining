<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the representative appearance of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on diffusion-weighted MRI has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at determining whether cytotoxic or vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is more predominant in the affected cerebral parenchyma and assessing the time courses and prognosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies on sixteen patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> who underwent diffusion-weighted MRI were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography in 11 patients and magnetic resonance angiography in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted images with echo-planar imaging were obtained using two or three b values, with the highest b value of up to 1,000 s/mm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A region of interest was placed on an area of abnormal signal intensity to calculate apparent diffusion coefficients (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 16 patients had lesions with an increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, whereas, three of these nine patients also had lesions with a decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 11 patients who underwent initial MRI within 7 days of their last episode, eight had lesions with an increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, of whom three had lesions mixed with both decreased and increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies of these three patients revealed the development of hemorrhagic infarction in two and subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> develops more predominantly and earlier in dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, though cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was also associated with the pathological changes in the early phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decrease of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value is presumed to reflect severe pathological conditions and indicate possible future development of infarction or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
