<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occasionally present with a malignant clinical course marked by parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> accompanied by either a severe neurological deficit or a persistent deterioration on therapeutic levels of antithrombotic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This scenario precludes traditional revascularization strategies with direct fibrinolytic infusion because of the risk of exacerbating the preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current series, we describe our experience using the AngioJet (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, MN), a rheolytic mechanical thrombectomy device, in conjunction with systemic heparinization to achieve rapid sinus revascularization without fibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database identified four patients ranging in age from 28 to 67 years (three women, one man) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and rapidly deteriorating levels of consciousness who underwent transfemoral intravenous rheolytic thrombectomy using the AngioJet XMI and/or Xpeedior catheters (Possis Medical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The imaging features, treatment specifications, and disease outcome were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients underwent successful mechanical thrombectomy as indicated by restoration of blood flow through the affected sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the four patients demonstrated normalization of angiographic transit time after thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these three patients, rapid neurological improvement ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient died during the periprocedural period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No procedural complications were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Systemic heparinization with adjunctive rheolytic thrombectomy (without fibrinolytic therapy) is a safe and effective treatment strategy for selected patients with dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
