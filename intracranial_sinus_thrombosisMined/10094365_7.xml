<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six patients, ages 3 days to 17 years, were examined with CTCVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were scanned with 1-mm collimation and 2:1 pitch 30 seconds after the initiation of a hand injection of 2 mL/kg nonionic contrast material (320 mg/dL <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>) with a maximum dose that did not exceed 80 mL (minimum volume, 5 mL in a 2.5-kg infant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reconstructions were done using maximum intensity projection and integral rendering algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients had CTCVI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and DSA (42 vessels studied) and nine patients had CTCVI and DSA (136 vessels studied) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scores of 1 (not present) to 3 (present in continuity to the first bifurcation) were assigned independently by two radiologists to 32 vessels in each correlated case for each available technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no technical failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTCVI depicted 18 thrombosed dural sinuses, three vascular malformations, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo>, and four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent of the vessels seen with DSA were also seen with CTCVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CTCVI identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vessels seen on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Helical CTCVI is an effective technique for assessing the intracranial circulation in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this initial comparison, CTCVI showed more vascular detail than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and had fewer technical limitations </plain></SENT>
