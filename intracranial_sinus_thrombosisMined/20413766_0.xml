<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of trauma-related dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (DVST) in high-risk patients with blunt head trauma who are examined with multidetector computed tomographic (CT) venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval, HIPAA compliance, and waived informed consent, the authors retrospectively studied the findings in 195 consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> blunt head trauma and were examined with multidetector CT venography because they were considered to be at high risk for DVST owing to the presence of a fracture near a dural venous sinus or jugular bulb or a high index of clinical suspicion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonenhanced CT images and CT venograms were reviewed for the presence of skull fractures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and traumatic DVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance and nonenhanced CT images subsequently obtained in patients with traumatic DVST were assessed for hemorrhagic venous infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed by using Student t and Pearson chi(2) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multidetector CT venography depicted <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of 98 dural sinuses or jugular bulbs in 57 (40.7%) of the 140 patients with skull fractures extending to a dural sinus or jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four (55%) of the 98 sinuses or bulbs had occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DVST was seen in only those patients with skull fractures extending to a dural sinus or jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the skull fractures extending to the transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, or jugular bulb, those of the petrous temporal bone had a higher risk (50%, 36 of 72 fractures) of traumatic DVST than did those of the occipital bone (34% risk [32 of 93 fractures]) (P = .044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, among the skull fractures extending to the superior sagittal sinus, those of the occipital bone had a higher risk (67% [eight of 12 fractures]) of traumatic DVST than did those of the parietal (39% risk [11 of 28 fractures]) and frontal (24% risk [four of 17 fractures]) bones (P = .065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four (7%) patients with traumatic DVST had associated hemorrhagic venous infarctions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> secondary to occlusive DVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with blunt head trauma, multidetector CT venographic evaluation should be performed only if there is a fracture extending to a dural venous sinus or jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
