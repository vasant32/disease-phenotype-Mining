<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, seven boys and three girls died, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> before July 1972 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> was the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One child died of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one died as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877147" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiorespiratory failure</z:e> following salt-poor albumin infusion, and another died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000097'>focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> not apparent on initial biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the remaining child was uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis according to histopathologic subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">minimal change disease</z:e> showed no statistically significant differences in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001966'>mesangial abnormalities</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000092'>tubular atrophy</z:hpo> were associated with higher mortality than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nil disease</z:e> or focal glomerular obsolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of the ten children who died had either failed to respond to initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> therapy (initial nonresponders, n = 5), or responded but relapsed during the initial 8 weeks of treatment (early relapser, n = 4), even though only one quarter of the total sample were nonresponders or early relapsers (P less than .0005) </plain></SENT>
