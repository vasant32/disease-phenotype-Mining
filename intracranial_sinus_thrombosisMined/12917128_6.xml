<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We attempted to identify the cause of abnormal venous flow seen during arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in the inferior petrosal sinus by use of in three female patients (aged 51, 48, and 70 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Arterial 3D time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was performed with a tilted optimized nonsaturating excitation pulse sequence (TR/TE, 31/7; flip angle, 20 degrees; section thickness, 65 mm; effective thickness, 1 mm; number of sections, 1 to 2); no magnetization transfer pulse sequence was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography of the neck was performed with a 3D fast low-angle shot pulse sequence (TR/TE, 4.6/1.8; flip angle, 40 to 45 degrees; section thickness, 80 mm; intersection gap, 1.5 mm; acquisition matrix, 180 x 256; acquisition time, 27 s) on a system with a whole-body coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients, 3D time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography revealed abnormal vascular signal originating from the left cavernous sinus, continuing through the inferior petrosal sinus, and ending in the proximal internal jugular vein at the jugular bulb level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal vascular signal at the jugular bulb, sluggish flow and flow-related enhancement in the left internal jugular vein, and signal void in the contralateral jugular vein were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced delayed-phase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography showed stenosis in the left brachiocephalic vein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High signal intensity noted at the inferior petrosal sinus resulted from retrograde flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retrograde flow was due to blood stealing from the internal jugular vein toward the cavernous sinus because of venous stenosis in the brachiocephalic vein </plain></SENT>
