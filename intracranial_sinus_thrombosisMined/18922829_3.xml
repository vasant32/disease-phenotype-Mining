<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 29, 2006, for use in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) who have received at least one prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FDA approved lenalidomide with a restricted distribution program, RevAssist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In two randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies, the combination of lenalidomide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (LD) was compared with placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) in patients with MM who had received at least one prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following a prespecified interim analysis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, an independent data-monitoring committee advised the sponsor to halt the two studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For both studies, the interim analysis for efficacy revealed a statistically significant longer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> with LD than with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most clinically relevant grade 3 and 4 adverse events that occurred more frequently in the LD arm were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and intracranial venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were reported more frequently in patients treated with LD than with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FDA approved lenalidomide based on interim results from two multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized trials comparing the combination of LD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> that revealed a longer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> with LD than with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The major toxicity observed during these trials was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The serious toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide is only available under the RevAssist Program </plain></SENT>
