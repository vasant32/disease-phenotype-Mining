<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The causes of cerebral sinus and vein occlusion and the accompanying parenchymal changes remain largely unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical variability and low incidence of the disease complicate systematic clinical investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal studies are indispensable; however, existing animal models of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> do not allow for long-term follow-up studies and are not suitable for pharmacological recanalization because sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is induced by ligation and injection of thrombogenic substances and does not resemble sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) by careful topical application of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> onto the SSS of rats, leading to highly reproducible occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was performed immediately after initiation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and on postoperative Days 1, 2, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion- and T2-weighted images allowed for calculation of the apparent diffusion coefficient and T2 relaxation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular status was assessed by venous magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were assessed with the rotarod test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven days after induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, partial recanalization (50.7% of the SSS remaining occluded) was accompanied by a resolution of early generalized changes of the apparent diffusion coefficient and of T2 relaxation time, indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of the entire brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with sham-treated animals, clinical skills in the experimental group improved over time, which was statistically independent from the degree of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histopathological analysis revealed no signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first animal model of SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that offers the possibility to investigate pathophysiological aspects of the disease as well as the influence of therapy on the nature of disease progression </plain></SENT>
