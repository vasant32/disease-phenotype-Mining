<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To characterize the spontaneous clinical course of isolated sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> based on planar skull radiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis we evaluated a total of 155 radiographs of 55 children 2 weeks to 9 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sagittal, coronal and lambdoid sutures were evaluated on the basis of pairs of ap and lateral radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sutures were examined with respect to their boundary, activity, and conspicuity to be visualized (based on a 3-grade score system) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six selected points on the skull X-ray defined eight measured distances, three angles, and a width-length index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To document changes over time, the measurements were correlated to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a correlation between suture activity and selected parameters was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sagittal suture could be continuously or partially depicted in more then half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> radiographs taken during the first year of life, The measured distances and angles were concordant with results from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With increasing age, the width-length index deviated from standard values while other parameters approximated the norm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the case of children younger than twelve months, the sagittal suture appears radiologically open in many cases despite clear-cut <z:hpo ids='HP_0000268'>scaphocephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Definite signs of progressive plurisutural fusion were not found in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dolichocephalic deformity remained unchanged while some signs of scaphocephalic appearance actually improved </plain></SENT>
