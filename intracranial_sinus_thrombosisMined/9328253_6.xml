<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Dural puncture is regarded a safe procedure when contraindications are carefully excluded and has so far not been recognised as a risk factor for cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients are described with CVST after dural puncture in the presence of additional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In four out of five patients complete investigations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> were performed at least one month after withdrawal of oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In three out of four patients tested, activated protein C (APC) resistance due to heterozygous coagulation factor V R506Q mutation (factor V Leiden) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient was using oral contraceptives as a circumstantial risk factor and three had had spinal anaesthesia for surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family history of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retrospective evaluation of 66 patients with CVST disclosed that dural puncture was the fourth most common risk factor (8%) possibly contributing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dural puncture may constitute an additional risk factor for CVST especially in patients with APC resistance or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In such patients a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screen is indicated </plain></SENT>
