<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients with angiographically verified superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were examined by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography (TCCS) after intravenous application of a pulmonary stable ultrasound contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 10 patients without venous pathology had contrast-enhanced TCCS; in addition, 30 healthy adults had plain TCCS to determine the identification rate for deep and superficial venous segments and to define <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of venous blood flow velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The straight sinus was identified in 22 of 30 healthy subjects by plain TCCS, and in 9 of 10 patients by contrast-enhanced TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean peak and angle-corrected blood flow velocity was 19.1 +/- 7.1 cm/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The superior and inferior sagittal sinuses were identified by contrast-enhanced TCCS in 2 and 1 subjects, respectively; they were never seen on plain TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 2 patients with sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> a distinct increase of blood flow velocity was recorded from the straight sinus (83 and 92 cm/sec), most likely reflecting collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These preliminary data indicate that TCCS and particularly contrast-enhanced TCCS permit identification and blood flow measurements within the deep and occasionally, the superficial venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCCS may contribute to an assessment of hemodynamic repercussions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and may indicate the risk of venous infarction and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
