<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, and poor oral intake are common after hematopoietic cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpesvirus infections</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334228" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) were the most common causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 76 patients with 78 episodes of these symptoms to discern the causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were based on histology of skin and intestinal biopsy specimens, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> cultures, and responses to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean day of study entry was day 57+/-31.3 posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD was the most common cause of symptoms, affecting 63 patients (81%) as the sole cause of symptoms and an additional 4 patients (5%) who had other concurrent causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with GVHD had marrow donors who were unrelated or HLA-mismatched in 27/63 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>, and apoptotic epithelial cells were the most useful findings for the diagnosis of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> therapy (1-2 mg/kg/day) was effective in 58 of 63 patients (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus, cytomegalovirus, or Candida was found in six patients, three of whom had concurrent GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other causes of symptoms were medications (one patients), parenteral nutrition (one patient), and sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD is now the dominant cause of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> in marrow transplant patients who are beyond day 20 posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis can be made clinically in most cases and confirmed by endoscopic biopsy of gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e>, medications, and rare cases of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease are much less common </plain></SENT>
