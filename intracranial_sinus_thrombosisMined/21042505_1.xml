<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, altered consciousness, focal neurological deficit, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> developing during or immediately after treatment with L-asparaginase should alert the treating physician to the possibility of CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediate imaging of the brain should be done using CT and MRI and the veins should be visualized noninvasively by CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report two children on induction therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and altered consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were seen on CT in one patient and the empty delta sign was seen after contrast injection; however, the early changes were missed by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI detected dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> relatively earlier in another patient, while the CT findings were equivocal; in this patient, contrast-enhanced MRI showed the empty delta sign and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography confirmed absent flow in the superior sagittal sinus, which was diagnostic of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rapid anticoagulation was started with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and maintained with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The child with a unilateral small nonhemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> made a complete recovery while the other, with bilateral hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, did not survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We stress the importance of early diagnosis of CSVT using CT and MRI in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> being treated with L-asparaginase; this will permit timely treatment </plain></SENT>
