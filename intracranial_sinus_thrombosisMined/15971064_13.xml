<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Only 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhages</z:hpo> (SAHs) are not of aneurysmal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among those, circumscribed SAHs along the cortical convexity are rare and have only been described in singular case reports so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a collection of 12 cases of SAH along the convexity, of non-traumatic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 10 years, 12 cases of circumscribed SAH along the convexity were identified at our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentations, neuroradiological SAH characteristics, further diagnostic work-up to identify the underlying aetiologies, the therapy and clinical outcome were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' chief complaints were unspecific cephalgia, focal or generalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and focal neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Typical signs of basal SAH, such as nuchal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>, thunderclap-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or alteration of consciousness, were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed different aetiologies, namely postpartal posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (three), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005318'>cerebral vasculitis</z:hpo> (two), dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (two), cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (one), intracerebral abscesses (one) and cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases remained unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the underlying disease and symptomatic medication led to good clinical outcome in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, we demonstrate that the clinical presentation, localisation and aetiology of cortical SAH differ clearly from other SAHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic work-up with MRI and eventually DSA is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mostly, the causative disease can be identified, and specific treatment allows a favourable outcome </plain></SENT>
