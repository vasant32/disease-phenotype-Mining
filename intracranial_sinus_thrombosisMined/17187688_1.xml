<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Benign Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) may be caused, at least in part, by intracranial sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> is normally due to derangements in blood coagulation cascade which may predispose to <z:mp ids='MP_0002551'>abnormal clotting</z:mp> activation or deficiency in natural inhibitors' control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to examine the strength of the association between risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of prothrombotic abnormalities among a randomly investigated cohort of 17 patients with BIH, was compared with 51 healthy subjects matched for sex, age, body mass index, height and social background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> was significantly higher in patients than in controls (3 vs 1, p &lt; .001; Fisher Exact Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate to high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies (beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> type I) were found in 8 out of 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2, fibrinopeptide A (FPA), and PAI-1 were demonstrated in patients group (5.7 +/- 1.15 nM vs 0.45 +/- 0.35 nM; 8.7 +/- 2.5 ng/mL vs 2.2 +/- 1.25 ng/mL; 45.7 +/- 12.5 ng/mL vs 8.5 +/- 6.7 ng/mL, respectively; p &lt; .001; Fisher Exact Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene polymorphisms for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, prothrombin mutation 20210 A/G, MTHFR 677 C/T, PAI-1 4G/5G, ACE I/D were detected in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In agreement with other authors our data suggest a state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> in BIH associated with gene polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings also showed that mutations in cardiovascular genes significantly discriminate subjects with a BIH history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association between coagulation and gene derangements, usually regarded to as cryptogenic, may suggest a possible pathogenetic mechanism in BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>So, a prothrombotic tendency may exist that would, at least in part, explain some cases of BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although based on a small population, these findings raise the exciting possibility of using these haemostatic factors as markers for selecting high-risk subjects in BIH disease </plain></SENT>
