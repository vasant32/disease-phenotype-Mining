<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the head revealed multiple calvarial and skull base fractures, <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusions</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Air was noted within the superior sagittal sinus, indicating a fracture involving the sinus and suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
