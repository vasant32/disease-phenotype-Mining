<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The computed tomographic (CT) appearances of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are variable, but include visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> within the sinus on post-contrast images (the 'empty triangle' or 'empty delta' sign) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review of 104 consecutive examinations was undertaken to assess the incidence of the empty delta sign in a paediatric group undergoing CT examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of examinations in which a sagittal sinus filling defect was seen in three or more images, was unexpectedly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An overall incidence of 18% was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Defects due to bone artifact and defects seen on only one or two slices were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age distribution of abnormal scans was markedly skewed towards young infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of 27 examinations (33%) in infants less than 1 month of age, were positive for filling defects, compared with six of 21 (29%) aged between 1 and 12 months, and four of 56 (7%) aged over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review suggests that the finding of a filling defect or empty delta sign in the sagittal sinus is not pathognomonic for sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that results in clinically apparent manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Second, a filling defect apparent on CT may resolve spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of non-occlusive sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may be significantly higher than previously recognized, particularly in young infants where predisposing conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> coexist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that the sensitivity of the empty delta sign is approximately 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study implies that either the empty sign has limited specificity in the paediatric population, or that unrecognized non-occlusive sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is much more frequent than previously described </plain></SENT>
