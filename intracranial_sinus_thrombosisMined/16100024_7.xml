<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a multicenter prospective observational study, we compared clinical and imaging features, risk factors, and outcome of adult patients aged &lt;65 (young and middle-aged patients) and &gt; or =65 years (elderly patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 624 adult patients with CVT were registered and followed-up for a median of 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one (8.2%) were aged &gt; or =65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presentation as an isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome was less frequent in elderly patients (4/51 versus 139/573, P=0.008), whereas depressed consciousness (17 versus 97, P=0.005), and mental status changes (22 versus 115, P=0.001) were more frequent in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of elderly patients was considerably worse than that of younger patients, as only 49% of elderly patients made a complete recovery (versus 82% in younger patients), whereas 27% died and 22% were dependent at the end of follow-up (versus 7 and 2% respectively in younger patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinoma</z:mp> (5 cases) was more frequent as a risk factor for CVT in elderly patients (P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, elderly patients were more likely to experience thrombotic events (HR=4.8, 95% CI=1.9 to 11.9) and were less likely to experience severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (HR=0.2, 95% CI=0.02, 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with CVT have a distinctive clinical presentation: isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is uncommon, whereas mental status and alertness disturbances are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of CVT is worse in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
