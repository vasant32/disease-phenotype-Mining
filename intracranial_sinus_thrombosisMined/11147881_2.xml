<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distension and enlargement of the cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) and cavum vergae (CV), along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, was detected during the course of the disease and was observed to regress together with resolution of the venous occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> caused by sinus occlusion was thought to be responsible for the disturbed resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the CSP and CV in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case is unique because it is the first one to support the hypothesis of resorption of CSF in the cava by a pressure gradient involving the septal capillaries and veins </plain></SENT>
