<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the frequency and determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients with intracranial DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients with intracranial DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with pure hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or without available brain imaging for clarifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DAVF was diagnosed by cerebral catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognard classification and location of DAVFs were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics, outcome, and radiographic findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the patients with DAVFs were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients (4.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (mean age: 53.8 ± 13.4 years) and 128 patients were free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (mean age: 55.4 ± 15.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Men accounted for 83% in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> group and 34% in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chemosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> were more frequent in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and mental decline were more frequent in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DAVF was associated with highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> at locations other than the cavernous sinus or large sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> also correlated with types of DAVF involving cortical venous drainage, including type IIb (18%), III (15%), and IV (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No patient with DAVF type I and IIa had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients with concomitant DAVF and cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was higher than in DAVF patients without cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was the major subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in five DAVF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy was the most common choice in both groups, and fewer patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> group did not receive any treatment for DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Location and type of DAVF were two important factors related to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in DAVF patients </plain></SENT>
