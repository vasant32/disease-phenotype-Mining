<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is an important diagnostic tool in many interventions, particularly coronary and carotid artery angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, its application in the management of diseases of the cerebral venous system remains an unexplored territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report three patients in whom IVUS was used during angiography for the evaluation of venous flow obstruction secondary to venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, venous sinus stenosis, and a transverse sinus mass lesion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we review current literature to summarize previous experience, focusing on the advantages and limitations of IVUS technology in interventional cardiology, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, IVUS was used without any complications and provided critical information that guided further management of these distinct diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IVUS helped diagnose the presence of intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, severe stenosis, and a mass lesion in the transverse sinuses and also helped assess the response to angioplasty of the stenotic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IVUS is a promising tool that has potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and to guide the management of several diseases of the cerebral venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cases we describe suggest that IVUS can be successfully used when performing endovascular interventions in patients with obstruction of venous outflow secondary to venous sinus stenosis, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or mass lesions </plain></SENT>
