<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The management of intracranial dural sinuses <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is still controversial and uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report the cases of 7 patients with non-traumatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the dural sinuses and describe the most important radiographic findings, the indication, effectiveness of antithrombotic therapy, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 7 cases of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> admitted, between 1994 and 1996, to our division </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent full anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was administered, using a dose of 25,000 units/day for two weeks; <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was given using a dose of 5 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment course was followed by maintenance treatment with a single administration of 5 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were submitted to close titration and coagulation profile monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 4 cases Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Angiography (Angio-MRI) was performed for following up the recanalization of the sinuses, resulting a persistent no patency of the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT scan, demonstrated an "empty delta sign" in the sagittal sinus, confirming no recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, six patients had have a good quality recovery, and one patient a moderate disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is an uncommon cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and may be mistaken, unless specifically sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The natural history of the disease is highly variable, with a mortality rates range from 10% to 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At present, in our opinion, the venous phase of Angio-MRI is the definitive examination, and a gold standard for diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our cases, antithrombotic therapy has been found to be a safe and effective treatment, despite contrast-CT scans and Angio-MRI showed no recanalization of the sinuses, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
