<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 2 cases of CVST who were successfully treated by means of loco-regional thrombolysis with urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first case we chose this treatment instead of i.v. <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> because clinical conditions of the patient appeared critical for life on hospital admission; in the second case loco-regional thrombolysis was performed because a full-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment over 8 days failed to improve the clinical picture of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the literature, there are no established criteria for the use of loco-regional thrombolysis in CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our own experience and few previous reports on the matter, we suggest that loco-regional thrombolysis should be considered an appropriate treatment for CVST when patients are at life risk, when an involvement of deep cerebral veins is present or when, after full heparinization, patients are doing poorly clinically </plain></SENT>
