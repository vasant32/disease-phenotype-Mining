<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Misdiagnosed and untreated can be dangerous for health and life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They should be always kept in mind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AiM: We discuss patients in whom defects of skull base were observed during operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These defects can lead to serious intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyse patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> operated in our department between 2004-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>250 operations on ears were performed in that period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss patients with intracranial otogenic complications and patients in whom defects of skull base were noticed by chance during operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Defects of skull base were observed in 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial complications were in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>1 patiens died because of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> of cerebellum, others were treated with good distant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Used methods of reconstruction were effective, we observed no discharge of cerebro-spinal fluid and no other intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It exists group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> that have asymptomastic defects of cranial fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These defects can be responsible for intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MRI and TC are very important in preoperative diagnostics </plain></SENT>
