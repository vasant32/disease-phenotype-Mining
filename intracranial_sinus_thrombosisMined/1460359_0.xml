<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As recent findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> with multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005244'>gastrointestinal infarctions</z:hpo> secondary to an imbalance of the cellular hemostatic pathway, extradigestive thrombotic complications might be mediated by the same vascular immune reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report an unusual case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBD1">regional enteritis</z:e>, the main point of interest being two-fold: first, this case provides a morphological evidence for an angiitic process as the cause of extradigestive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; second, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> remained subclinical for more than four years although the patient developed major venous thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
