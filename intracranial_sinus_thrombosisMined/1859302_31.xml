<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a series of eight cases that show a close resemblance to, but are not identical with, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) as normally defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of these cases are characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They include two cases of cranial venous outflow obstruction in which clinical or radiologic abnormalities precluded the diagnosis of PTC proper (cases 1 and 2); one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in which an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition precluded the diagnosis of PTC (case 3); two cases without either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> or a measured increase of CSF pressure, which in other respects, particularly in response to treatment, resembled PTC (cases 4 and 5); and three cases of what is thought to represent an infantile form of PTC (cases 6 through 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the analysis of these cases is twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, it is argued that these cases throw light on the mechanism of PTC itself, supporting a concept of a disturbance of CSF circulation in this condition, and that they are themselves illuminated by considerations of typical PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, the cases are used to frame a proposed classification of the pseudotumor syndrome aimed at broadening the diagnostic criteria applied currently to PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the pseudotumor syndrome has a single underlying mechanism (disturbed CSF circulation) and that recognition of this mechanism not only clarifies the pathophysiologic processes of PTC but also has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
