<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present the technique of endovascular transvenous manual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy (MAT) in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Present an alternative technique for endovascular transvenous thrombectomy in a series of CVST patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the records of six patients with medically refractory CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transvenous access via the femoral vein was used to advance an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> catheter of varying internal diameter (0.044, 0.054, 0.057, 0.070, 0.072) up to and through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue plasminogen activator was administered in select cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Manual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> with a 20 ml syringe applied to the catheter hub was applied as the catheter was slowly retracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presentation, technique, and outcome were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical presentation included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>, mental status changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On imaging, four of the six patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and mass effect present before treatment, while two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients demonstrated continued deterioration despite early and aggressive medical anticoagulation therapy, warranting aggressive intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> of the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinuses, straight sinus, sigmoid sinus, and internal jugular vein were performed in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Revascularization was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A modified Rankin Scale score of 1-3 was attained in 5/6 patients, while one patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series, transvenous MAT was a safe, simple, and effective revascularization technique to treat patients with CVST who remained refractory to medical management </plain></SENT>
