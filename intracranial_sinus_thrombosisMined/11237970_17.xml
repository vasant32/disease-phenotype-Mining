<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is often difficult because of its variable and nonspecific clinical presentation and the overlapping signal intensities of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and venous flow on conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared 3D contrast-enhanced magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequences with 2D time-of-flight (TOF) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and conventional spin-echo (SE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for the assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a phantom study, a plastic tube with pulsating flow was used to simulate the intracranial dural sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With 3D MP-RAGE, a variety of flow velocities, contrast material concentrations, and angulations between the phantom flow tube and the plane of acquisition were tested to measure their relationship to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a clinical study, 35 patients, including 18 with suspected dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, were studied with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed in a blinded fashion using DSA as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the phantom, the SNR of flow increased with increasing contrast concentration, but was not affected by the angle between the tube and scan slab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between SNR and velocity when the contrast concentration was 1.0 mmol/L or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the clinical study, dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as well as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the dural sinuses were seen better with 3D contrast-enhanced MP-RAGE than with 2D-TOF <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MP-RAGE showed the highest diagnostic confidence on ROC curves in the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MP-RAGE is superior to 2D-TOF <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and conventional SE <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in the depiction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venous structures and the diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and is a potential alternative to DSA </plain></SENT>
