<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of brain plasticity occurring in patients with NCC during and after the inflammatory process related to the parasite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, degeneration, and calcification within the host brain might be an independent factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with NCC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to assess this possibility cognitive performance of patients with mesial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tle">temporal lobe epilepsy</z:e> related to hippocampal <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MTLE-HS) with and without NCC was investigated through structured neuropsychological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cognitive performance of long term MTLE-HS patients with (HS-NCC group, n = 32) and without NCC (HS only, n = 48) was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imbalances between the two groups with respect to clinical, demographic, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological variables were adjusted by linear multiple regression analysis and Bonferroni correction for multiple tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There were no cognitive performance differences between HS-NCC and HS only patients, leading to the conclusion that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> calcified NCC per se does not aggravate the cognitive performance of patients with long term MTLE-HS </plain></SENT>
