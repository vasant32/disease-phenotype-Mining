<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether smoking, a major risk factor for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, is a risk factor also for CST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This work explored the association between smoking and CST in a hospital-based, multicentric, case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to avoid the confounding effect of the different risk factors for CST, we analysed the homogeneous subgroup of oral contraceptive users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of smoking in a group of 43 young women with CST (cases), whose oral contraceptive use was the only known risk factor, with a sample of 255 healthy contraceptive users of similar age (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of smoking in cases and controls was similar (26% vs. 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age and geographic area-adjusted odds ratio was 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-1.8; p=0.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smoking in oral contraceptive users does not appear to be associated with CST </plain></SENT>
