<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The imaging appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, partially recanalized dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has been incompletely described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to more fully characterize the imaging findings of this entity on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography (TOF-MRV), and elliptic centric-ordered contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography (CE-MRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and METHODS: From a data base of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, 10 patients were identified with imaging and clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, partially recanalized, dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain without and with contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent MRV, and 6 had both CE-MRV and TOF-MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four venous segments were thrombosed and were assessed in detail for multiple imaging features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most thrombosed segments were isointense to gray matter on T1-weighted images (85%), and hyperintense to gray matter on T2-weighted images (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visible serpiginous intrathrombus flow voids were visible in 23 segments (8/10 patients) corresponding with areas of flow signal intensity on TOF-MRV and enhancing channels on contrast MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four percent of thrombosed segments enhanced equal to or greater than venographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TOF-MRV and CE-MRV were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and CE-MRV more completely characterized the thrombosed segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The imaging appearance did not change in those patients with follow-up imaging (average 13.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo>, partially recanalized, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> has a characteristic appearance on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CE-MRV was abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, despite the intense enhancement of the thrombosed segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because of the highly selected nature of the cases reported, further study is required to determine whether these findings are present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of this condition </plain></SENT>
