<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study surveyed an 11-year period (February, 1980 to May, 1991); of 268 children receiving ECMO therapy for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopulmonary failure</z:e>, 94 patients died, 70 of whom were autopsied and permission for brain examination was granted in only 44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of ischemic neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (50%), focal cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (50%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> (52%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacia</z:hpo> (41%) was higher in this group of ECMO-treated patients than that observed in the general autopsy population from which the study patients were selected </plain></SENT>
