<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe a case of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the puerperal period and the difficulties encountered in the diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A 29-yr-old multiparous woman presented with a postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> four weeks after a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy and vigorous delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial presentation suggested spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (SIH) since there was no history of epidural or spinal anesthesia, or trauma or surgery to her back or neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conservative therapy was initially offered and then a lumbar epidural blood patch (LEBP) was performed, although it failed to relieve the postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A dural leak could not be demonstrated but an MRV (magnetic resonance venography) revealed a superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (SSST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was immediately initiated, the neurologist remained convinced that the postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was secondary to SIH, and, consequently, a second epidural blood patch was requested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was reluctant to perform an LEBP at this point and suggested continuing anticoagulation until a subsequent MRV demonstrated recannalization of the SSST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This advice was followed and the postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> resolved spontaneously with intravenous anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present case illustrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the management of this rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complication of pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case also highlights the importance of reviewing the differential diagnosis when considering treatment of a postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in the puerperium </plain></SENT>
