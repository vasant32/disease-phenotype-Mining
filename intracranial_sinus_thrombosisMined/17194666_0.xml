<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a term newborn with severe type 3 VWD who suffered a large <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> presumably subsequent to sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case is remarkable in two aspects: i) with respect to the low risk of perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> even in neonates with VWD type 3 and ii) since VWD type 3 with factor VIII:C levels &lt; 5 IU/dl does not seem to protect from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275,C0019069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophilia</z:e> advise atraumatic delivery of neonates with known or suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> disorders, however primary caesarean section in the absence of complications is not obligatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To answer the question whether the presented case could have an impact on the recommended management we carried out a worldwide survey including 24 participating specialized centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except a single case from Sweden of a female neonate with VWD type 3 who also had an inhibitor against VWF no further cases were reported to us </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in term neonates with severe VWD type 3 is a rare event that requires additional risk factors for manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the amendment of current guidelines does not seem to be mandatory </plain></SENT>
