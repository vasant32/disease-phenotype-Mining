<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient showed inertia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive behavior</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> two weeks after the operation and hyperlogia and hypergraphia four weeks later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which disappeared within six weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>General intelligence, language and memory were consistently preserved, though the scores of the performance IQ and the visual memory were relatively decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A few months after the operation emotional and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000751'>personality change</z:hpo> such as impatience and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> became evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the right lateral prefrontal area is concerned with personality and behavior and that the widespread resection holds general intelligence, language and memory within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range but relatively decreases non-verbal cognitive function that requires manual responses </plain></SENT>
