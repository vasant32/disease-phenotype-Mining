<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze the diagnostic effectiveness and application of computed tomographic (CT) angiography by using a new algorithm (hybrid CT angiography) in dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (AVFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for retrospectively postprocessing the raw data from CT angiography by using hybrid CT, which is a mixture of a bone subtraction and masking method for bone removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 22 patients with 24 dural AVFs and 14 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The grades in patients with dural AVF determined with hybrid CT angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were compared, and hybrid CT angiography was applied as a tool for planning endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adjusted Wald method was used to estimate confidence intervals (CIs), and the Cohen kappa statistic was used to assess interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hybrid CT angiography in the 24 dural AVFs revealed asymmetric sinus enhancement in 22 lesions (92%), engorged arteries in 19 (79%), transosseous enhanced vessels in 19 (79%), engorged extracranial veins in 13 (54%), engorged cortical veins in seven (29%), and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in four (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 lesions, at least two of six imaging signs for diagnosis of dural AVFs were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kappa test analysis revealed a high level of interobserver agreement (kappa, 0.56-1.00) in reading the diagnostic imaging signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed agreement between DSA and readers was 100% in the cavernous sinus region and in hypoglossal and clival lesions and 78%-89% in the transverse sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.97), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.00), 0.97 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.99), and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.98), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hybrid CT angiography is a promising tool for the diagnosis of dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It can provide key information necessary for treatment planning </plain></SENT>
