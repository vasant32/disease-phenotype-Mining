<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: Dural sinus occlusion is an infrequent but potentially devastating cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological course of events underlying it is, as yet incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cat model, regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured during control and 2, and 24 hours after superior sagittal sinus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Around 48 hours after superior sagittal sinus occlusion, experimental settings were terminated by perfusion fixation with 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> solution, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CBF was significantly reduced over the time-period of measurement (p &lt; 0.05) covering about 45% of the brain in planes that were affected by occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> venous infarction could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the newly-developed model of microsurgical ligation of the superior sagittal sinus in cats, we present for the first time an animal model for cerebral venous infarction that leads to a histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> venous infarction with a good reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The further advantage of this model is the fact that it mimics the clinical situation as far as possible by its inter- and intra-individual variance of extension of the venous infarction and by the slow reduction of CBF over 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequential PET imaging is a favourable, non-invasive method to gain further insight into the pathophysiological characteristics of experimental cerebral venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the new-developed cat-model as demonstrated in this study will be of great value for further and more detailed investigations of cerebral-venous infarctions, and for the experimental evaluation of therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
