<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI does not require ionizing radiation and can be done easily and safely in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is equal or superior to computed cranial tomographic (CT) scans in demonstrating most types of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI is often superior to CT scans in demonstrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumors</z:e>, although both studies are usually abnormal in highly <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No clear advantage was shown with either MRI or CT scans for fluid-filled intracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions of the brain stem and upper cervical region, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, are well delineated by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased signal from the paranasal sinuses was frequently evident by MRI, but, in most instances, there was no clinical indication of sinus disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large arteries can be visualized as an area of diminished signal, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased anatomic detail pictured by MRI allows the diagnosis of congenital defects, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001274'>agenesis of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> or septum pellucidum, that are not always apparent with CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although our experience with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100561'>spinal cord lesions</z:hpo> was not extensive, fluid-filled lesions within the cord can be reliably demonstrated </plain></SENT>
