<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Although conventional superselective chemical thrombolysis is frequently successful for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the technique has limitations and risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to develop a supplemental technique for achieving more rapid recanalization, using coronary microballoon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a successful application of this technique and technology that has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: After several days of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, a 29-year-old woman presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> neurological deficits secondary to complete occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and right transverse/sigmoid sinus complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Owing to her rapid neurological decline, she was referred for emergency endovascular intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: Initially, superselective chemical thrombolysis of the SSS was performed using urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, because of the extensive nature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and lack of initial therapeutic response, we elected to attempt mechanical thrombolysis with various coronary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty microballoon catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was accomplished by initial coaxial positioning of the device into an occluded segment, followed by gentle inflation and retraction of the device along the course of the right transverse sinus and/or SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These maneuvers were repeated with balloons of increasingly large diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Near-complete restoration of venous outflow was obtained within the SSS with preferential runoff into the left transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The right transverse sinus was only partially recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the patient's rapid neurological decline on presentation, she experienced a dramatic clinical recovery with near-complete reversal of neurological deficits within 24 hours of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report shows the feasibility of performing safe and effective mechanical thrombolysis with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty coronary balloon microcatheters within the major dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique can probably accelerate clot disruption and thrombolysis, possibly resulting in a more rapid restoration of venous flow </plain></SENT>
