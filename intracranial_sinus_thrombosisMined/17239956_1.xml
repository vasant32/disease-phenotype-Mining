<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After anesthesia, a 1.5 mm x 10 mm cranial window was made to expose superior sagittal sinus (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A filter paper strip soaked in 40% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> topically applied for 5 min to induce SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of these rats underwent autopsy at 24 h after rota rod study, other 9 rats underwent MRI after 24 h followed by autopsy at 36-48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On MRI, T2 hyperintense lesions were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 rats of study group but none in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On autopsy, TTC staining revealed changes in 7 out of 14 experimental rats but in none of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rota rod study results revealed an insignificant difference in the experimental and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in experimental or control group during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present experimental model is simple, easy to carry out and results in TTC staining changes in 50% and T2 hyperintensity on MRI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> which could be due to SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
