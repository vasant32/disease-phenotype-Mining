<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the reliability of single-slice phase-contrast angiography (SSPCA) as a rapid technique for the investigation of suspected dural venous sinus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Images were obtained on 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers to document the accuracy of SSPCA in the demonstration of slow flow states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> volunteers were imaged using sagittal and coronal SSPCA (slice thickness 13 cm, matrix 256 x 256, TR 14 ms, TE 7 ms, flip angle 20 degrees, peak velocity encoding rate 30 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sinus patency and flow rate were confirmed by measurement of flow in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses using quantified single-slice phase difference images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed in 50 patients undergoing routine brain scans in order to determine the optimal slice orientation for clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with suspected dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were also investigated with SSPCA and the diagnosis confirmed by one or more alternative imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imaging time was 29 s per acquisition and image quality was good in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variations in dural sinus patency and flow in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers were accurately predicted by SSPCA (kappa = 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of a single angulated slice (130 mm thick, para-sagittal image angled 30 degrees towards coronal and 30 degrees towards transverse) provided sufficient separation of right- and left-sided venous structures to allow use of a single projection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence and extent of sinus occlusions in 14 patients and the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 7 were accurately identified by SSPCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity in this limited study were both 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The SSPCA technique takes less than 30 s and provides a reliable and rapid technique for the diagnosis of dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
