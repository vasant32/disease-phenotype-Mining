<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) are interesting lesions, which can present as diagnostic and therapeutic challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were initially described as located solely in the dural venous sinuses, but during the last decade researchers have discovered them in other locations such as the tentorium and foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is understandable that they can develop in other locations because numerous arteriovenous shunts normally occur <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early reports emphasize that they are congenital; however, some investigators have proposed that they are acquired lesions arising after sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also have variable clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From 1975 to 2000 we treated 400 <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, of which 46 were dural </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 46 dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, 18 could be classified as skull base <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We restricted the designation of skull base <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> to those <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> located in the tentorium or adjacent to bones of the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of these <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> actually had their vascular nidus located in the bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The common dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were excluded from this category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presenting clinical features of these skull base <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> ranged from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They were treated by a combination of endovascular and microsurgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Skull base dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> are an interesting clinical entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Their clinical course, treatment and final outcome are variable depending on their location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They should be managed by a multidisciplinary approach </plain></SENT>
