<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify the common presentation(s) and the clinical and operative finding(s) in patients with cholesteatomatous and long-term noncholesteatomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> suppurative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> and to adapt a surgical management best suited to ensure long-term safety in these Papua New Guinean patients for whom postoperative follow-up is minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Port Moresby General Hospital, the tertiary referral center for otolaryngologic services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Eighty-one patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups who received a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> suppurative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo>, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo>, with or without its associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Canal-down (modified radical) mastoidectomy with wide meatoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE AND RESULTS: Adults were more commonly affected than adolescent or pediatric cases, and there was a male preponderance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 24 years (range, 13 months to 73 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Otorrhea remained the most common presentation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postauricular abscesses and fistulae were seen frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>Cholesteatoma</z:hpo> and granulation with polypoidal mucosa were frequent operative findings; a high incidence involved both the attic space and the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five (6%) patients had preoperative facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>; in addition, postoperative facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> developed in three (4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative "wet ear" was high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>Meningitis</z:hpo> was the most common intracranial complication, followed by lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were seven (9%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> altogether, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred as a direct result of otogenic intracranial complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lack of health consciousness, poor socioeconomic status, and lack of health care delivery system resulted in late presentations and poor postoperative follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hence, the canal-wall-down technique with wide meatoplasty is recommended to ensure a best possible one-time treatment in Papua New Guinean patients with cholesteatomatous or long-term "dangerous" <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> suppurative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> with or without complications </plain></SENT>
