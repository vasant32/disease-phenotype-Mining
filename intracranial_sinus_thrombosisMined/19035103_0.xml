<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences in etiology, symptoms, treatment, and prognosis between the patients with cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) before December 31 2000 and those after that date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The etiology, symptom, treatment, and prognosis of the 35 CVST patients admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMC) from January 1 1991 to December 31 2000 (Group A, n = 16) and those admitted from January 1 2000 to May 31 2007 (Group B, n = 19) were analyzed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The first two common causes were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> in Group A, while the first two common causes were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) The common symptoms and signs and positive rates were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (86%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (34%), focal neurological deficits (40%), vision deficits (43%), altered consciousness (31%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> (60%) without significant differences between these 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rates of the common symptoms and signs during discharge were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (77%), altered consciousness (73%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (67%), focal neurological deficits (57%), vision deficits (43%), and altered consciousness (31%) without significant differences between these 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) 38% of the patients in Group A (n = 6) received anticoagulation therapy, a rate significantly lower than that of Group B (79% , n = 19) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients in Group B received thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The etiological constituents of CVST patients admitted in PUMC has changed, the weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> has declined and that of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disease</z:e> has risen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of signs remains unchanged; however, the rate of anticoagulation has ascended </plain></SENT>
