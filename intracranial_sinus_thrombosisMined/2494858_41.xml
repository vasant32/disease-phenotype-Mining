<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent preoperative embolization of the external supply followed by direct surgical exposure of the sinus: liquid adhesives were used in four patients and coils in the remaining three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients had complete obliteration of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> and there was 95% reduction in the remaining three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had transvenous placement of coils from a transfemoral approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three, the ipsilateral sigmoid sinus was thrombosed and a contralateral approach across the torcular herophili was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coils were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients; one patient also had liquid adhesives placed within the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete cure was achieved in one patient, 95% reduction in another, and 50% and 40%, reductions in the remaining two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two transient complications occurred, one related to venous occlusion secondary to liquid adhesives and another related to transient occlusion of the vestibular aqueduct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Obliteration of dural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> involving the transverse and sigmoid sinuses can be achieved by placement of embolic material within the involved sinus from a transvenous approach; both coils and liquid adhesives can achieve this goal </plain></SENT>
