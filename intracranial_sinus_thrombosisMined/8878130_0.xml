<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen consecutive patients aged 14-50 years (mean = 29 years) without previous drug treatment for PTC underwent 99Tcm-HMPAO SPET, cranial CT and MRI studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No patient had evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial mass</z:e> lesions on the CT or MRI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analysis of the 99Tcm-HMPAO SPET studies revealed impaired rCBF in nine (53%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CT and MRI studies revealed an empty sella in two patients, dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in one and a slit ventricle in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 13 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT and MRI results had rCBF abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, three patients with CT and MRI abnormalities had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 99Tcm-HMPAO scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that patients with PTC have functional abnormalities that are revealed by 99Tcm-HMPAO brain SPET </plain></SENT>
