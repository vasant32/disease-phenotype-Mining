<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date successful repair of isolated penetrating injury to the torcular herophili has not been reported without significant associated morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a gunshot wound injury to the occipital region with retained bullet fragment in the confluence of the sinuses causing traumatic sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Occipital and suboccipital craniotomy for removal of bullet in the torcula, repair of sinus defect, and repair of depressed skull bone fragments was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure resulted in restoration of proximal and distal flow across the dural sinus system and preservation of torcular sinus patency with excellent neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Technical considerations in the repair of penetrating torcular injuries are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gunshot wounds with retained bullet fragments in the torcula can be successfully repaired with preservation of neurological function after retrieval of metallic foreign body and restoration of venous sinus patency </plain></SENT>
