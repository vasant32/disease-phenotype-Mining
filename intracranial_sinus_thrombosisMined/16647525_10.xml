<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Ten-year retrospective review at a tertiary children's hospital identified 21 cases of intracranial complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen males and eight females with mean age of 13.3 years were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall 18 of 21 (81%) exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation, most commonly epidural </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of 21 (14%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 4 patients were managed surgically, requiring craniotomy in 13 of 21 (61.9%) and endoscopic sinus surgery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>) in 10 of 21 (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (33%) required multiple operations during admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (90%) had a total of 30 organisms cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral flora was observed in 12 of 21 (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Polymicrobial infections</z:e>, seen in 9 of 21 (43%), were significantly associated with the need for craniotomy (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean hospital stay was 15 days, and mean length of IV antibiotic was 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial complications of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> often require craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Oral flora and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymicrobial infections</z:e> were prominent in this series </plain></SENT>
