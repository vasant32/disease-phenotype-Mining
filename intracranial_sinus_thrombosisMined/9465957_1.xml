<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To show the frequency of visualisation of the dural sinuses and cerebral veins with CT-angiography (CTA) with special reference to anatomical variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 34 CTA (1 mm slice thickness, 120 ml nonionic KM, 2 ml/s flow, 40 s prescanning delay) were performed in 30 patients to examine the cerebral venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an anatomic study of cadavers (n = 10) without known disease of the cerebral veins the great sinuses were opened and examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The superior sagittal, the transverse, the sigmoid and the straight sinus could be evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cortical and deep cerebral veins as well as the small sinuses were visualised in 12-97% of the examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was diagnosed in 4 of the 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric superior sagittal sinus bifurcation (12/30), a hypoplastic sinus transversus (2/30) and a persistent sinus occipitalis (4/30) were found as anatomical variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 10 of the 30 patients we discovered 17 dural sinus filling defects produced by large arachnoid granulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar findings could be demonstrated in the pathologico-anatomic examination series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT angiography is suitable for detailed evaluation of the cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anatomic variants, arachnoid granulations, as well as fibrous bands and septa, which may lead to misinterpretation in conventional CT, can be clearly demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of CT in diagnosis of sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were increased thereby </plain></SENT>
