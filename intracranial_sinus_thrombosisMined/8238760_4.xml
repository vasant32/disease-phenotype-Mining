<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report was prepared to increase the awareness among otolaryngologists of the diagnosis and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e>, and to encourage expert consultation when indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One patient with dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> complicating an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo>, one patient with a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0003001'>glomus jugulare tumor</z:hpo>, and one patient with a sudden <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> were treated by the otolaryngology service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Suspicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were evaluated by the hematology service, and appropriate anticoagulative therapy was recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient with an inherited hypercoagulopathy and two patients with acquired hypercoagulopathies were treated for otologic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients were stabilized and discharged on life-long anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third patient, in spite of intensive medical and surgical support, eventually succumbed to complications to which an acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> made a significant contribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expert consultants made the hematologic diagnoses and treatment recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Otolaryngologists should be aware that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> may now be more accurately diagnosed and characterized, and that thorough investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> may affect treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
