<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pediatric patients with LST seen in our department between 1999 and 2007 were included; there were 9 cases involving 6 boys and 3 girls whose ages ranged from 8 to 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> been treated with antibiotics elsewhere prior to admission, and the duration of symptoms before admission ranged from 5 to 18 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting symptoms were ear discharge, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, otalgia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiologic evaluation included computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent radical mastoidectomy with incision of the lateral sinus and removal of its content </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pseudomonas and Proteus spp were the most commonly identified organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Otogenic LST still poses a serious threat that warrants immediate attention and care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is often associated with other intracranial complications, such as cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging play an important role in the management of this disease </plain></SENT>
