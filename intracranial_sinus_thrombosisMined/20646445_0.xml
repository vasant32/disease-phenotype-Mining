<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 24 cases of pregnant women with CVT among 15 625 deliveries in Xuanwu Hospital from January 2002 to October 2009, including 7 cases happened during pregnancy and 17 during puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology, clinical presentations, imaging examination results, other relevant examinations, and pregnant outcomes of these patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Incidence and etiology: the incidence of CVT during pregnancy and puerperium was 0.15% (24/15 652) and 29% (7/24) of the patients fell ill during pregnancy and 71% (17/24) during puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five were complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e>, while another 5 complicated with hyperemesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One woman was complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CVT was identified after spontaneous delivery in 9 cases and 8 after cesarean section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) Clinical presentations: Among the 24 CVT cases, 22 (92%) suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 16 (67%) reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, 15(63%) experienced hyperspasmia and 6 (25%) complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On admission, 8 (33%) patients were unconscious, 3 (13%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, and 8 (33%) were febrile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) Imaging and laboratory examinations: twelve patients underwent digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) and were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifteen women showed superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in MRI and magnetic resonance intravenous angiograph (MRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Examination of the fundus found <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> cerebral sinus fluid and laboratory routine tests were reported in 13 cases, but 6 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, 7 cases of abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 5 cases of abnormal international normalized ratio (INR), 3 cases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated platelet count</z:e>, 4 cases of positive D-dipolymer, 1 cases of low hemoglobulin level (&lt;10 g/L), 4 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0002596'>abnormal hematocrit</z:mp>, and 10 cases of elevated fibrinogen (&gt;4 g/L) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(4) Management and pregnancy outcomes: among the 7 cases happened during pregnancy, 2 were complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e> and delivered through cesarean section immediately and discharged after proper management including depressurization, spasmolysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five of the 7 cases presented with CVT during early pregnancy, among which 1 was discharged after dilation and curettage followed by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, 2 received endovascular thrombolysis after which one was discharged and the other one left with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and 2 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among the 17 patients presented with CVT during puerperium, 10 received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy after which 4 were fully recovered, 5 left with functional disturbance (3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, 1 with incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo>) and one died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Among the rest 7 cases who underwent endovascular thrombolysis, 3 were fully recovered, 3 left with functional impairment (1 with blind and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>), and one died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Altogether, there were 14 patients underwent systemic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy after which 7 were fully recovered, 5 left with dysfunction and 2 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 cases received endovascular thrombolysis, 4 were fully recovered, 4 remained some dysfunction and 2 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CVT, mostly presented as superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, are more common in puerperium than during pregnancy and DSA is the golden standard for the diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and endovascular thrombolysis are effective in the treatment of CVT, but may left the patients with functional disturbance or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Prompt diagnosis and treatment ensure a better outcome for pregnant women complicated with CVT </plain></SENT>
