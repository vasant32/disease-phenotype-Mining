<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (DAVF) can be separated into two types: DAVF which drains through an affected sinus (sinus type) and DAVF with direct reflux to the cortical vein (non-sinus type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present report attempted to clarify the mechanism of formation and development of DAVF focusing on the emissary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e>) hypothesis.First, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> occurs at the penetrating point of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> on the dura due to idiopathic or secondary causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local inflammatory reactions induce vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and neovascularization, and subsequently create arteriovenous (AV) connections on the arteriole level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> communicating with dural arteries might play a role as draining routes at first, they start to degrade due to compression of enlarged emissary arteries or to a hemodynamic shift to the drainage pathway of least resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the occlusion of drainage pathway through <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> into the sinus or cortical veins may form, resulting in clinically detectable DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AV shunt then expands to the surrounding dura associated with recruitment of feeders from distant sites induced by expression of angiogenetic factors and a shift in the hemodynamic balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In sinus type DAVF, the sinus is progressively compartmentalized and finally occludes due to thrombogenesis with activated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> or to hemodynamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the sinus wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This progression results in the mature, aggressive DAVF with drainage impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous mechanistic hypotheses focusing on sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinus thromboses</z:e> cannot explain the pathogenesis of non-sinus type of DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of DAVF may be concerned by the thrombo-occlusive change of sinus, the unique theory presented in this report may enable an understanding of the common etiology of both types of DAVF </plain></SENT>
