<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to compare the various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences when they are used to visualize and evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were retrospectively analyzed using computed tomography, MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> sequence included T1-weighted spin echo (SE) imaging, obtained before and after administration of contrast medium, T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2*-weighted conventional gradient-echo (GRE), as well as three-dimensional (3D) venous time-of-flight MRA and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our patients, the venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinus thromboses</z:e> were most successfully detected during the T2*-weighted GRE sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was well visualized with the T1-weighted SE sequence in three of four patients in whom it was in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T2*-weighted GRE sequence was superior to the T2-weighted TSE, T1-weighted SE, and FLAIR sequences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography showed the thrombosed segment of the venous sinus and well correlated with the conventional angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The T2*-weighted conventional GRE sequences may be the best method for detecting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it would seem to be beneficial to integrate a T2*-weighted conventional GRE sequence into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> protocol to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
