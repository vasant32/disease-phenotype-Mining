<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report about 6 children who had intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after 3 to 8 doses of L-asp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial symptoms of the cerebral events were similar--<z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by cerebral computerized tomography (CT) or/and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and two a hemorrhagic infarction with typical findings in the cerebral CT or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two other patients were interpreted as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002641'>peripheral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They showed nontypical hypodense cortical and subcortical areas without any contrast medium enhancement in CT and hyperintense areas in T2-weighted MRI scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered from neurological symptoms, and showed obvious regression of CT and MRI findings which correlate with the good prognosis of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both CT and MRI are useful in diagnosis and follow-up of cerebrovascular complications of L-asp therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CT and MRI findings of the reported cases seem to reflect different appearances of the same entity, i.e. <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of venous vessels of different size with or without congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic complication </plain></SENT>
