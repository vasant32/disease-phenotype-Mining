<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed bilateral frontal SAH and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the right temporo-parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His condition deteriorated despite conservative treatment and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> became enlarged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angiographic diagnosis was extensive sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from the superior sagittal sinus to the bilateral transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mechanical clot disruption was performed under systemic anticoagulation using <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> balloons catheter and a rheolytic catheter via the right internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excellent angiographic results were obtained, and the patient recovered gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six months after treatment, the patient had only upper quadrant hemianopsia and no other neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that mechanical clot disruption with systemic anticoagulation as a safe effective treatment for cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, especially in patient whom had large intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
