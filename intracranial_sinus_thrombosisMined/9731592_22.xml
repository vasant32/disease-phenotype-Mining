<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been recently reported that a G--&gt;A transition at nucleotide position 20210 in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is associated with elevated plasma prothrombin levels and an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, it is unknown whether this polymorphism also represents a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Venous blood samples were collected from 45 patients with CVT and from 354 healthy blood donors as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second control group consisted of 131 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplification of DNA was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The G--&gt;A transition at nucleotide position 20210 of the prothrombin gene was detected by allele-specific restriction digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The G20210--&gt;A transition in the prothrombin gene was found in a heterozygous form in 4 of 45 patients with CVT (8.9%) and in 8 of 354 healthy control subjects (2.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically significant (P=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The G20210--&gt;A transition increased the relative risk for CVT approximately 5-fold (age-adjusted odds ratio 5.7; 95% CI 1.5 to 21.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, only 3 of 131 subjects (2.3%) were heterozygous for the G20210--&gt;A transition, which corresponded to the prevalence in the group of healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The recently described G20210--&gt;A transition in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is an inherited risk factor for CVT but obviously not for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
