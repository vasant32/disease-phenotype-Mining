<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 50 patients: 24 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> NBD, 12 multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> other than <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and 9 patients had BD without neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI studies were performed according to a standard protocol with a 0.2 T imager </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists, blinded to the diagnosis, age and sex of the subjects, reviewed the films independently, twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separate assessments were made for a set of items: dural sinus pathology, widening of ventricles and sulci, brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, lesions of the cerebral cortex, discrete lesions of deep white matter, basal ganglia, brain stem and cerebellum and the presence of smooth periventricular high-signal foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver agreement was substantial or better, and interobserver agreement moderate to substantial for most items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> NBD we found low sensitivity on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assessed items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dural sinus pathology or brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were highly specific, but parenchymal lesions in different sites had uniformly low specificity </plain></SENT>
