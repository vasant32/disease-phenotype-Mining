<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An uncommon form of presentation is characterized by unilateral lobar haemorrhage associated with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and parenchymal distortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> presentation, this might resemble haemorrhage into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In delayed presentations, the haematoma, being iso- or hypodense and showing peripheral ring-like enhancement, can mimic aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> or infective processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As this is an uncommon condition, misdiagnosis is common with the potential for mismanagement and adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present five such consecutive cases that were initially misdiagnosed as other entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each of these cases on closer inspection show features observed on CT and MRI that should have suggested a diagnosis of dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these cases progressed to not only extensively involve the superficial sinuses but also the deep veins, with a significant adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The imaging features of this interesting variant of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The haemodynamic basis for haemorrhage and anatomical basis for the lateralization of the lesions are discussed </plain></SENT>
