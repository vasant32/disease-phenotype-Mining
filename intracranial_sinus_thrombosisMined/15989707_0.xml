<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a 66-year-old man who presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of undetermined origin, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and an <z:mp ids='MP_0002944'>elevated lactate dehydrogenase level</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of ILBCL was established by a bone marrow biopsy that showed CD20+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells confined within the lumina of sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A karyotypic analysis obtained from the bone marrow aspirate showed a hypotetraploid clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple high-signal areas in the periventricular white matter above the tentorium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal dural enhancement (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pachymeningitis</z:e>) close to the medium third of the superior sagittal sinus was also observed and was related to a partial superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as confirmed by venous magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 8 courses of a CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) plus rituximab regimen, normalization of the superior sagittal sinus and of the bone marrow was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a follow-up of 15 months, the patient is still considered in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation highlights an unusual vascular aspect of ILBCL and the efficacy of the current standard treatment for this age group (CHOP/rituximab) in this particularly aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
