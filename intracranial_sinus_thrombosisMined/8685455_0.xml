<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>January, 1989, to February, 1995, six hundred MRA examinations were performed in different vascular districts, with a 1.5-T superconductive magnet, the time-of-flight (TOF) technique and 2D and 3D acquisitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arteries, epiaortic vessels and renal arteries were studied with FISP 3D sequences; intracranial veins, thoracic vessels, vena cava and pelvic vessels were studied with FISP 2D sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pitfalls were observed in 56 of 600 MRA exams (9.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 56 pitfalls, 26 (46.4%) were in epiaortic vessels, 15 (26.7%) in intracranial vessels, 6 (10.7%) in renal arteries, 6 (10.7%) in thoracic vessels, 1 (1.7%) in the inferior vena cava and 2 (3.5%) in iliac vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stenoses were overestimated in 21 patients and underestimated in three; 16 patients were misdiagnosed and 16 were false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for cerebral vascular lesions, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 7 transverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinus thromboses</z:e> were false positives, while 3 lesions were misdiagnosed as venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As for 26 MRA exams of thoracic vessels, stenoses were overestimated in 16 patients and underestimated in 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndrome</z:e>, where the left vertebral artery was misinterpreted as occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 MRA exams of thoracic vessels, 1 patient was misdiagnosed as having an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 5 patients were misdiagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> infiltrating aorta and superior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As for renal vessels, 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal arteries were misdiagnosed as false positives and 4 stenoses were overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the inferior vena cava, a partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> was misinterpreted as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 2 MRA exams of iliac vessels, a stenosis and a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were misinterpreted as false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that MRA pitfalls are caused by the incorrect use of the various techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pitfalls we observed can be classified as caused by three types of artifacts: saturation, turbulence and paramagnetic substance artifacts </plain></SENT>
