<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatments guidelines for lower extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) could be applied to patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST), the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and survival for these two diseases were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with CVST at the Mayo Clinic between 1978 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> rates (cerebral or noncerebral) were compared with those from patients with DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival rates were also compared with white US residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four patients (age 40 +/- 19 years) were included (58% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>, prescribed in 50% of patients, was continued for an average of 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean of follow up of 36 +/- 47 months (464 patient-years), 20 patients experienced 23 recurrent venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> for an event rate of 5.0/100 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This recurrence rate was similar to patients with lower extremity DVT (3.8/100 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates were lower for CVST (2.8/100 patient-years) compared with DVT (6.2/100 patient-years; p = 0.001) patients but higher than expected for white US residents (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> were the only predictors of poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> nor survival was influenced by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is similar after cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) and lower extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with DVT, survival rates are higher following CVST but are adversely influenced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and older age </plain></SENT>
