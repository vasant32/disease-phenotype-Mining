<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single institutional pilot study of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was conducted from January 1992 to December 1996 at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive children with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, made by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI with venography, ultrasonography, nuclear brain scanning, or conventional angiography were eligible for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION: Most children underwent multiple radiographic tests for evaluation of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 32 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, CT was performed in 30, MRI with or without venography in 26, ultrasonography in 11, and nuclear brain scanning in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e> were located at the superior sagittal sinus (50%) and right lateral sinus complex (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 30 consecutive children with 32 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> during the 5-year study (2 girls had recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age was 6.2 years (age range, 3 days to 18 years), and the sex of the patients was evenly distributed (15 girls and 15 boys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary associated clinical conditions consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (n = 5), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> (n = 3), perinatal distress (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (n = 1), and neurosurgery for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (n= 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remainder were previously healthy children older than 1 month (n = 10) and newborns (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight children were ineligible for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy because of an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n = 6), a postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk after neurosurgery (n = 1), or a prolonged delay from the diagnosis to the time of referral (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten children received standard <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and 12 children received low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) (enoxaparin <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eighteen children were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> for 3 months after initial <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy, and 4 patients received LMWH for the entire course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the 12 patients treated with LMWH, but there was 1 case of clinically silent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the standard <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, in particular LMWH, is safe and may have a role in the treatment of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A randomized controlled trial is warranted </plain></SENT>
