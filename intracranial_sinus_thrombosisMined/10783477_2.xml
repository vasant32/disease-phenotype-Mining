<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments that demonstrated the arachnoid villi as the site of absorption were based on non-physiologic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF does not flow through the arachnoid villi, because villi require bulk flow and bulk flow of CSF does not exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF is transported through the choroid fissure and recycled through the tela choroidae by the choroid plexus, with reentry into the ventricular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Observed failures of the effete arachnoid villus theory can be readily explained by the cycling theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A complete cycle of CSF is suggested to pace the 90 to 100-minute ultradian rhythms found in human <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
