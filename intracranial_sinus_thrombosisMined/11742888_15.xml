<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular outcomes were analyzed and effectiveness of treatment in reducing vascular risk was evaluated by comparison of actual to predicted number of vascular events, with the use of historical controls from a landmark study of 629 untreated patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> beta-synthase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 158 patients had a mean (range) age of 29.4 (4.5 to 70) years; 57 (36%) were more than 30 years old, and 10 (6%) were older than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 2822 patient-years of treatment, with an average of 17.9 years per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were markedly reduced from pretreatment levels but usually remained moderately elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 17 vascular events in 12 patients at a mean (range) age of 42.5 (18 to 67) years: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (n=2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (n=5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n=1), sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
