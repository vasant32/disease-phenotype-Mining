<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We present the typical neuroradiological findings in three patients with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet in comparison with a review of neuroradiological and histopathological findings described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In three male patients aged 32-57 years with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and neurological symptoms cranial CT and MRI studies were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings were monitored over a period of 6-18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cerebral and renal DSA were performed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In two patients we found <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory lesions located in the brainstem and the periventricular white matter, some of which were associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory disruption of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions decreased in size under treatment, but complete resolution was not consistently noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the third patient we found a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus but no other intracranial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings agree with those described in the literature as being typical of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory lesions most commonly occur in the brain stem, followed by the basal ganglia and the cortex and white matter of both the cerebrum and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and cortical or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e>, white matter lesions have little diagnostic value, irrespective of their location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The definitive diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is made on the basis of clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
