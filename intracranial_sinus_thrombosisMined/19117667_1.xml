<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a review of our last 820 nontraumatic-SAH patients and analyzed the management and outcome of patients where the SAH origin was not a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to assess outcome 3 months after event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients had atypical causes of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients with Hunt and Hess (H&amp;H) scores from 1 to 3 without focal neurological deficit (FND), 8 perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal SAH, 4 blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e>, 1 sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and 1 unknown-origin-SAH (UOS) were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (93%) of these 15 patients were conservatively treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients with H&amp;H scores from 3 to 5 and FND, 8 tumors, 1 cavernoma, 1 sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, 1 blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e>, 2 UOS, and 3 dural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (88%) of these 17 patients were interventionally treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neurological condition 3 months later was good (GOS 4 and 5) in 12 of the 15 cases (80%) admitted with low-H&amp;H scores, as well as in 13 of the 17 cases (76%) admitted with high-H&amp;H scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients died and four developed a severe disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with atypical causes of SAH and high-H&amp;H scores at admission are likely to harbor an intracranial organic process producing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite this poor initial condition, their 3-month outcome can be similar to those of patients with low-H&amp;H scores if the origin of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is properly treated </plain></SENT>
