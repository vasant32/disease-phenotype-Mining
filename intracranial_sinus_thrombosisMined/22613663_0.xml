<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of CVST with intense and diffuse dural enhancement that resulted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pachymeningitis</z:e> in one patient and spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in another </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical data of these two patients are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with CVST, dural enhancement is not always a secondary change to CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It can be a manifestation of the underlying causes of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When diffuse and intense dural enhancement is revealed, sufficient ancillary tests are warranted to rule out other potential pathological changes of the dura mater those can result in CVST </plain></SENT>
