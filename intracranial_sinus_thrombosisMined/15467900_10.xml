<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology and pathophysiology of cerebral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CSVT) in the paediatric population is still poorly understood, and the role of thrombophilic risk factors remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our multi-center case-controlled study we studied 46 patients with CSVT diagnosed from April 1996 to December 2003, consecutively referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screen were compared to 112 healthy paediatric controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was applied according to treating physicians' decisions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were prospectively followed for a median of 4.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 46 children, 8 had CSVT diagnosed in the neonatal period and therefore were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of single <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> markers and combinations of thrombophilic risk factors were similar among cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among children with CSVT co-morbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e> was present in most patients at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven out of 8 children with idiopathic CSVT had thrombophilic risk factors as compared to 31/38 patients with co-morbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation was initiated in most patients, 11/46 patients continued therapy for a total of one year or more post event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither clinical presentation nor initial treatment decisions were affected by presence of thrombophilic risk factors in our study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> prevalence was not increased in children with CSVT as compared to controls, however <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was more frequent among children with idiopathic CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, those selected patients would benefit most from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> work-up, required for long-term therapy considerations </plain></SENT>
