<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a multinational (21 countries), multicenter (89 centers), prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up at 6 months and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependence as assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score &gt;2 at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From May 1998 to May 2001, 624 adult patients with CVT were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up (median 16 months), 356 patients (57.1%) had no symptom or signs (mRS=0), 137 (22%) had minor residual symptoms (mRS=1), and 47 (7.5%) had mild impairments (mRS=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (2.9%) were moderately impaired (mRS=3), 14 (2.2%) were severely handicapped (mRS=4 or 5), and 52 (8.3%) had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependence were age &gt;37 years (hazard ratio [HR]=2.0), male sex (HR=1.6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (HR=2.7), mental status disorder (HR=2.0), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on admission CT scan (HR=1.9), <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep cerebral venous system (HR=2.9), central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (HR=3.3), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (HR=2.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (2.2%) had a recurrent sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 27 (4.3%) had other thrombotic events, and 66 (10.6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of CVT is better than reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A subgroup (13%) of clinically identifiable CVT patients is at increased risk of bad outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive therapeutic interventions, to be studied in randomized clinical trials </plain></SENT>
