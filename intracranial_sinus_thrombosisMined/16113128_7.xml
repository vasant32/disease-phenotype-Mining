<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children presenting to a specialist <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> clinic over seven years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> as their main complaint were assessed by clinical history, physical and neurological examination, neuroimaging where indicated, and by follow up using prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> diaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 815 children and adolescents (1.25-18.75 years of age, mean 10.8 years (SD 2.9); 432 male) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was 21.2 months (SD 21.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging (brain CT or MRI) was carried out on 142 (17.5%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of patients had idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, tension, or unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty one children (6.3%) had other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> that were unrelated to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in three children (0.37%, 95% CI 0.08% to 1.1%) was related to active intracranial pathology which was predictable on clinical findings in two children but was unexpected until a later stage in one child (0.12%, 95% CI 0.006% to 0.68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in childhood is rarely due to serious intracranial pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Careful history and thorough clinical examination will identify most patients with serious underlying brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> symptomatology or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000751'>personality change</z:hpo> should lower the threshold for imaging </plain></SENT>
