<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 29 patients with angiographically proved <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was made from January 1989 to December 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations were performed on either a 0.5- or 1.5-T superconductive scanner in multiple planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct dural sinus venography, cerebral angiography, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous sinus pressure measurements were obtained in 11 of 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified five distinct stages of brain parenchymal changes; each stage correlated with increasing intradural sinus pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pressures measured in this study ranged from 20 to 50 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain parenchymal changes were reversible up to stage III if thrombolytic treatment was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beyond stage III, there were some residual changes, even after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stage V patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> leads to distinct stages of parenchymal changes, the severity of which depends on the degree of venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, which, in turn, is closely related to intradural sinus pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As intradural sinus pressure increases, progression from mild parenchymal change to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> may occur if thrombolysis is delayed </plain></SENT>
