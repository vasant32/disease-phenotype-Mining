<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Morphologic changes in the dural sinuses and emissary veins of the posterior fossa relate closely to the development of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report characteristic findings of imaging in six patients with a rare and forgotten emissary vein called the petrosquamosal sinus (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a larger group of patients with ear abnormalities, we selected six patients from three ENT imaging centers, because they had CT features suggestive of a PPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was the criterion for inclusion in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were explored by high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography was performed in three patients to determine the presence and patency of the emissary vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PPS was bilateral in two patients and unilateral in the other four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It affected mainly the left side (left:right ratio, 5:3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had associated inner ear (n = 2) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0008609'>middle ear malformations</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of six patients had jugular vein <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, with development of emissary mastoid veins in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Petrosquamosal sinus can be identified on HRCT in a typical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is encountered more frequently in patients referred for congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002693'>abnormalities of the skull base</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This rare anatomic variant should be assessed before surgical treatment, because proper identification of these large venous channels would be of interest to the surgeon </plain></SENT>
