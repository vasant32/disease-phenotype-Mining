<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe different patterns of associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in preterm and full-term infants with cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CSVT) and to assess whether these different patterns are related to gestational age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Magnetic resonance scans of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neonates (six preterm, 24 full term) with suspected CSVT, collected over a 7-year period in two neonatal intensive care units, were evaluated to assess patterns of associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between the two gestational age groups were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSVT was confirmed on magnetic resonance venography in 26 of 30 neonates (six preterm, 20â‰¥36 weeks' gestational age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The straight (85%) and superior sagittal (65%) sinus were most often affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several sinuses were involved in 81% of infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>White matter damage affecting the entire periventricular white matter was seen in five of six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) was common in both groups (4/6 preterm, 16/20 full term) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frontal punctate white matter lesions with restricted diffusion (15/20) and thalamic haemorrhage associated with IVH (11/20) were the most frequent lesions in full-term infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Focal arterial infarction was present in four of 20 full-term infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six infants died in the neonatal period (four preterm, two full term) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRIs at 3 months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors showed evolution of the lesions with frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in 13 of 20 (12 full term) and delayed myelination in seven of 20 (six full term) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preterm and full-term neonates show different patterns of associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Extensive white matter damage is the predominant pattern of injury in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infant</z:e>, while an IVH associated with a thalamic haemorrhage and punctate white matter lesions are more common in the full-term infant </plain></SENT>
