<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVF) are rare vascular lesions of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> with potentially significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experience in the treatment of children with dAVF is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Our neurosurgical and neurointerventional pediatric database was retrospectively reviewed for patients with dAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, pial fistulae, vein of Galen malformations and extracranial fistulae were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was used to assess radiographic outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed by the pediatric Functional Status Scale (6=<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, maximal incapacity=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between July 2003 and June 2011, seven patients with dAVF were treated, with a mean age at presentation of 4.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms included facial venous prominence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e>; one patient (14%) had asymptomatic dAVF discovered on imaging follow-up after craniotomy for cavernous malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases (28%) were associated with vascular anomaly syndromes, PHACE association and PTEN associated syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was identified in four patients (57%) and was associated with a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> or trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete obliteration was achieved in six of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment was exclusively endovascular in six patients and by combined surgical/endovascular means in the remaining patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No treatment complications were experienced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Functional Status Scale scores at an average of 2 years of follow-up were 6 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment is effective in the obliteration of dAVF in children and is well tolerated, with patients having excellent prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Genetic screening and hypercoagulable workup are indicated, particularly when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other anomalies</z:e> or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> coexist </plain></SENT>
