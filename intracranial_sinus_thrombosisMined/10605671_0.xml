<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We undertook this study to determine the clinical, neuroimaging findings, etiologies and final outcome of 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> diagnosed in a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study we analyzed the clinical and neuroimaging findings of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> collected at our hospital from 1980 to 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was made by angiography and/or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Final outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin scale and patients were included in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences between groups were tested using uni and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (10 women) with a mean age of 41.9 years were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical pattern was focal cerebral signs (70.5%) followed by symptoms/signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (12%) and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was made by conventional angiography in 12 cases (70.5%) and by magnetic resonance imaging in 5 (29.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent site of venous occlusion was superior sagittal sinus (47%) followed by lateral sinus (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Etiologies were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> (29%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (23.5%), oral contraceptives (12%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (12%) and unknown in 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients (59%) had minor neurological sequelae during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A decreased level of consciousness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> were associated with a worse functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our series the most frequent clinical pattern was focal cerebral signs and the main etiology was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A relatively good prognosis was observed in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A decreased level of consciousness and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> were the factors associated with a bad prognosis in these cases </plain></SENT>
