<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mass lesion and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were ruled out by brain CT and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF pressure was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF pressure fluctuated with menstrual cycle, sometimes showing over 600 mmH2O with worsening of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
