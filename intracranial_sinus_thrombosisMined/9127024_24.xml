<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and results of direct thrombolytic therapy in intracranial dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by infusion of alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients were treated during a 2-year period for intracranial dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A microcatheter was placed directly into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the dural sinus via the transfemoral route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis was initiated with a rapid injection of 10 mg of alteplase over 10 minutes, followed in 3 hours by a continuous infusion of 50 mg, then a continuous infusion at 5 mg per hour until complete thrombolysis or a total dose of 100 mg per day had been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeat thrombolysis was tried the following day if complete recanalization did not occur at 100 mg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful recanalization with improvement of symptoms was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time required for complete thrombolysis was between 8 and 43 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total dose of alteplase ranged from 50 to 300 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications of a small intrapelvic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and oozing at a femoral puncture site occurred in separate cases, but were not related to the amount of infused alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms obtained 1 to 4 weeks after the procedure showed no evidence of reocclusion of the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Direct fibrinolytic therapy with alteplase is safe, fast, and effective in treating dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, to prevent hemorrhagic complications, further studies are required to determine its optimal dose and proper rate of administration </plain></SENT>
