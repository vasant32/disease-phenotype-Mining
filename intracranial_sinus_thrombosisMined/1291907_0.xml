<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They found shortening of latency of P2 wave potential in relation to the control by 5.5-13.3 msec, appearing after 4-6 hours following occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurement indicated an increase in pressure following SSS occlusion from the control medium value 6.8 mmHg to 12-13 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual cortex in cat (area 17) is situated along the posterior portion of SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occlusion of this vessel results in local haemostasis, which is likely to affect the physico-chemical properties of visual cortex cells, especially in the slow conducting system X (X cells can be found exclusively in area 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The partial disappearance of this system activity results in reducing the signal and noticeable shortening of latency to peak P2 wave of VEP </plain></SENT>
