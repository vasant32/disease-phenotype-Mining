<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An isolated non-specific mass in upper clivus was initially suspected to be derived from paranasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clival lesion was approached by an endonasal transsphenoidal route and diagnosed as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, progressive enlargement of an orbital mass was recognized, with eyelid <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> and swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed massive paranasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> and an intra-orbital mass, which was proved to be an orbital SPA by open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> might have been caused by primary paranasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, and the origin of orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> was suspected to be cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> based on the preoperative radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These unusual lesions should be kept in mind as one of the differential diagnoses </plain></SENT>
