<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies suggested a male predominance in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, mirroring gender differences in adults but were limited by small sample sizes or unconfirmed diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to study gender within a large international series of confirmed cases of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2003 to July 2007, the International Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study enrolled children (0 up to 19 years) with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at 30 centers in 10 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neonates were those &lt;29 days of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated the "expected" gender ratio for our study as the weighted average of population-based childhood gender ratios in enrolling countries weighted by the number of subjects enrolled in each country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>chi(2) tests were used to compare the observed gender ratios in our series with this expected ratio (51.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1187 children with confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 710 were boys (60%, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male predominance persisted after stratification by age (61% for neonates, P=0.011; 59% for later childhood, P=0.002) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype (58% for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, P=0.004; 65% for cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The greatest proportion of males occurred among children with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and a history of trauma (75%, P=0.008), although boys were also overrepresented among those with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and no trauma (57%; P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no gender differences in case fatality or deficits at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> appears to be more common in boys regardless of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, or history of trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further exploration of this gender difference could shed light on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms in both children and adults </plain></SENT>
