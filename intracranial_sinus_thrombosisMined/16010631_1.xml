<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the following study was to examine the change of symptoms as well as the change of incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/PATIENTS: The records of 113 children who received mastoid surgery due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> were retrospectively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data covered a regional group of patients during a period of 25 years (1979 - 2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Considering the drop of the birthrate from 1991 in the East German countries, there was a significant increase of the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients had a mean age of 2,5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The classical symptoms like "retroauricular swelling, tenderness and protrusion of the auricle" were only noted by 47 children (41.6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative complications appeared as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and septic lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 11 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> cultures, taken during surgery yielded in 55.7 % Streptococcus pneumoniae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The therapy contained a surgical intervention combined with antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An early surgical treatment by mastoidectomy or antrotomy supported by antibiotics represents the safest method to avoid complications </plain></SENT>
