<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CST) needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis is essential because early treatment may prevent morbidity and may even be life-saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Definite exclusion, however, needs advanced neuroradiologic diagnostics, which are not readily available in many hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because measurement of D-dimers has been demonstrated to be helpful in excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, our aim was to investigate whether D-dimers would be also sensitive enough to exclude CST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a prospective multicenter study over a 2.5-year period including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who came to the emergency departments with symptoms suggestive of CST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed either by magnetic resonance venography, spiral computed tomography scan venography, or intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>D-dimer levels were measured at admission and analyzed by the same method in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 343 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CST was diagnosed in 35 patients, of whom 34 had D-dimers above the cutoff value (&gt;500 microg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the 308 patients not having CST, D-dimers were elevated in 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of D-dimers was 97.1%, with a negative predictive value of 99.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specificity was 91.2%, with a positive predictive value of 55.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>D-dimers were positively correlated with the extent of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and negatively correlated with the duration of symptoms (Spearman rank correlation coefficients 0.76, -0.58, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer measurement is useful in patients with suspected CST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> D-dimers make the presence of CST very unlikely </plain></SENT>
