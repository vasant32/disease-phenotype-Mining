<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has rarely been associated with closed head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a unique case involving the use of endovascular thrombolysis in the treatment of traumatic dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old male patient suffered a severe closed head injury while skiing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He developed refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> requiring <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the dominant right transverse and sigmoid sinuses, with partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urokinase was administered via a microcatheter within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> as a bolus of 250,000 units and then as a continuous infusion of 60,000 to 100,000 units per hour for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was maintained in a <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and heparinized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serial angiography was performed to assess the sinus patency and efficacy of thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 48 hours of thrombolysis, angiography demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patency of the superior sagittal, right transverse, and right sigmoid sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intracranial pressure decreased after thrombolysis and was manageable with conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Within 48 hours of the completed thrombolysis, the <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> were withdrawn and the patient's neurological status rapidly improved until the time of discharge 2 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This case documents a rare instance of traumatic dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> resulting from a closed head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, endovascular thrombolysis resulted in subsequent opening of the dural sinuses and effective intracranial pressure management, despite the presence of a hemorrhagic <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was effective in maintaining sinus patency and was used safely in conjunction with urokinase in this setting of head injury </plain></SENT>
