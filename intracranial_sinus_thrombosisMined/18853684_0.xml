<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations vary, though persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is almost always reported, meaning that differential diagnosis should be performed to rule out other causes of postpartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recognized risk factors for this disease are the prothrombotic state of pregnancy (third trimester), excess weight, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> Accidental dural puncture, protein C and S deficiencies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and the use of oral contraceptives have also been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic test of choice is magnetic resonance imaging, as it is convenient and harmless, though transcranial Doppler ultrasound can also be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary angiography is the gold-standard test </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the upper longitudinal sinus associated with persistent postpartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and a history of a failed attempt at epidural puncture for <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> during labor </plain></SENT>
