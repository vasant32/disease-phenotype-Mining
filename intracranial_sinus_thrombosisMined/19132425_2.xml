<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to measure the accuracy of multidetector CT angiography (MD CTA) in the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients &lt;or=40 years with spontaneous intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (IPH) presenting to the emergency department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After institutional review board approval, a retrospective study was performed of 43 consecutive patients &lt;or=40 years, who presented to our emergency department with IPH and that were evaluated with MD CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MD CTA images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist to determine IPH location, presence of a vascular abnormality, and associated extraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy was measured comparing it to the available reference standards, which included conventional catheter angiogram (CCA), surgical macroscopic findings, and pathology results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for risk factors and correlation with final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MD CTA demonstrated an accuracy of 97.7%, with a sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI 0.79-0.99) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 0.74-0.99) for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in young patients with IPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, MD CTA had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 100%, and the NPV 93.8% in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 43 patients included in the study, 28 patients (65%) had a causative vascular etiology for the IPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 28 patients with vascular etiologies for the IPH, 11 had an <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> (39.2%), nine a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (32.14%), seven dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (25%), and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (3.57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MD CTA is highly accurate in the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in the setting of IPH, which as a group represents the most frequent etiology of IPH among patients age &lt;or=40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MD CTA performed in the Emergency Department provides accurate, rapid and critical presurgical and premedical treatment information in young patients with IPH </plain></SENT>
