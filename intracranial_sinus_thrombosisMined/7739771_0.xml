<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We successfully treated a case of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by direct thrombolysis using an endovascular technique in combination with postoperative <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 19-year-old female, developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> affecting her whole head on December 13, 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was admitted to our hospital the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination upon admission revealed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo>, nor was there any abnormality in CT scan, either plain or enhanced, taken on the day of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's consciousness deteriorated in the early morning of December 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI and cerebral angiography revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> from the confluence of the sinuses to the right transverse and sigmoid sinus, with disturbed circulation through deep cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic thrombolytics, steroid and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> were started, but, on the next day, the third ventricle was compressed by bilateral swelling of the basal ganglia, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since her consciousness deteriorated further despite ventricular drainage and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy, direct thrombolytic therapy was performed on December 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A catheter was placed in the superior sagittal sinus, and 600,000 units of urokinase was locally injected, followed by postoperative <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient's condition improved rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On CT scan, the bilateral swelling of the basal ganglia disappeared along with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At about 1 month after endovascular surgery, MRI and cerebral angiography revealed recanalization of the deep cerebral veins, straight sinus and confluence of sinuses with improved opacification of the left transverse sinus, although the right transverse sinus was found to be re-occluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
