<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using a newly devised model of dural sinus occlusion, we investigated the pathophysiology of venous haemorrhage as well as venous circulatory disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and diploic veins (DV) were occluded in 16 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured for 12 hours after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment, cerebral water content was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another 8 cats additional occlusions of cortical veins were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated with Evans blue or horseradish peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SSS and DV occlusion produced a significant increase in ICP and CBV concomitant with a significant decrease in rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral water content also increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no transition of Evans blue and horseradish peroxidase through the cerebral vessels, and no haemorrhages could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the additional occlusion of cortical veins produced haemorrhagic infarctions with Evans blue extravasation in 6 out of the 8 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that dural sinus occlusion may lead to an increase in CBV and cerebral water content resulting in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and decreased rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> in this model seemed to be mainly hydrostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, and might also be contributed by cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The additional occlusion of cortical veins might be essential in the development of haemorrhage in this model, and the blood-brain barrier was also disrupted in these areas </plain></SENT>
