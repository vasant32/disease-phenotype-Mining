<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report eight cases of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) associated with a "Chiari type I malformation." In four cases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography performed in the neonatal period did not demonstrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000932'>posterior fossa anomaly</z:hpo>, which appeared on later scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the other cases the MRI was performed in infancy and the anomaly was already present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the venous phases of the posterior fossa angiograms and the MRI in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight cases, the angiograms showed a reflux in the cerebellar veins, via the petrous vein, associated with a uni- or bilateral stenosis or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the distal posterior dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in two cases the posterior fossa returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on MRI following endovascular treatment, while in three cases the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> of the cerebellar tonsils decreased after the embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> becomes irreversible when the venous outlet is incapable of taking the flow even when the VGAM has been treated adequately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In eight additional cases of VGAM for which MRI and angiogram studies were available and in which stenosis or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of posterior dural sinuses was present without tonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath>, no reflux into the cerebellar veins was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the posterior fossa hydrovenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> is a result of inadequate venous drainage and that the tonsillar descent is reversible if adequate venous drainage is reconstituted following therapeutic embolization of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> is not a consequence of mass or raised intraventricular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observation suggests that in some other conditions, the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Chiari I malformations</z:hpo>" may be secondary to early hydrovenous dysfunction of the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
