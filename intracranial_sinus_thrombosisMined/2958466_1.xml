<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with a clinical and a radiological diagnosis of cranial sino-venous occlusion (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi>) were randomly assembled and selectively studied in a retrospective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven instances were related to the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> and 12 were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> group were older and had a better prognosis than the patients in the nonmeningioma group, but angiography was still necessary in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> to diagnose <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi>, whereas computed tomography (CT) was most helpful in permitting the diagnosis in the nonmeningioma group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent CT abnormality seen in this latter group was the "delta" or empty triangle sign (75% of scans), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> (42%) and venous infarction (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recent availability of intravenous digital subtraction angiography has helped confirm the diagnosis in a faster, safer and more reliable way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Careful interpretation of CT, especially in patients with <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi> unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo>, may result in decreased morbidity and mortality as a result of earlier diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
