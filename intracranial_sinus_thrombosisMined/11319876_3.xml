<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency (RF) ablation produces transmural atrial lesions in vitro, and may provide advantages over incisions currently used in maze surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of open-heart endocardial RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen sheep (42.8 +/- 4.4 kg, age &lt; 2 years) underwent left thoracotomy with placement of pacing leads on a pulmonary vein and the left atrial dome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On cardiopulmonary bypass, lesions were made using incision and suture or a novel RF ablation device in three sites: <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> = circle excluding pulmonary veins, IAB = line across the interatrial bundle, SVC = line from the superior to the inferior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pacing across the <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> lesion was attempted to assess the completeness of each lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preselected animals (incision n = 4, RF n = 5) were recovered and pacing attempts were repeated at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After sacrifice, hearts were sectioned and measured for lesion size and completeness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RF ablation lesions took less time to create (total bypass time: RF 51.8 min vs incision 106 min, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial rupture</z:e>, or coronary sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> lesions were complete as demonstrated by the inability to pace across them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stained sections demonstrated that acutely studied incision lesions were thinner than RF lesions; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions were transmural and similar in width at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RF ablation consistently created transmural lesions more quickly than the incision and suture method and without additional complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endocardial RF ablation appears to be a simple and effective alternative to surgical incisions during open-heart atrial Maze procedures </plain></SENT>
