<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> that require surgical interventions has decreased substantially over the past few years, it is a prevailing condition for which clinicians should remain vigilant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a 3-year review [June 1998 to June 2001] in our hospital of surgical records of patients with complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> that were treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 16 patients with complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo>, of which nine [56%] were intracranial; brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were the most common intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracranial complications were present in 15 [94%] of the patients; mastoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> [40%] was the most common extracranial complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven [44%] patients had two or more concomitant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with intracranial complications recovered well with no neurological deficits after aggressive antibiotic therapy and initial surgical treatment by neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modified radical mastoidectomy was the most common surgical otological procedure that was performed in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive antibiotic therapy and combined management of cases by otologists and neurosurgeons are the key to reducing the morbidity and mortality of the serious complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
