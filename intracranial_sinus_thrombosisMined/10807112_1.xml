<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The association of these three domains was investigated using a single case multiple baseline design with two phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phase A comprised 6 weeks that coincided with an inpatient admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase B comprised 3 months spent at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A battery of visual spatial tests was completed every fortnight during the A phase and at the end of the B phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two new tests of relevant neurologic function with control data were developed and used weekly during the A phase and at the end of the B phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first test recorded the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of her walking, and the second test recorded her depth perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANT: A 35-year-old woman who suffered a venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with visual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During Phase A, she achieved significant functional gains in mobility, dressing, bathing, and domestic tasks, in the context of unchanging psychometric test scores and static relevant neurologic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During Phase B, she achieved few functional gains, despite improvements in neurologic status, demonstrated by depth perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Everyday function can progress without improvement in neurologic and cognitive status </plain></SENT>
