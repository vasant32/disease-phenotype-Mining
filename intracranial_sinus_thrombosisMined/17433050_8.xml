<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are hardly any reported data on NCSE in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospectively 210 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> admitted to neurological intensive care unit (NICU) of a tertiary care center in south India were studied for the frequency of NCSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated initially with 60-min emergent EEG (EmEEG) and subsequently by continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 210 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> admitted to NICU, the diagnosis of NCSE was established in 22 (10.5%) patients, in 12 (55%) patients with 60-min EmEEG and in 10 (45%) after cEEG monitoring for 12 to 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 22 patients with NCSE, 32% had subtle motor phenomena, these were not an initial presenting features, but were apparent during cEEG recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> medical or neurologic etiology was the risk factor in 68% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and cortical sino-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CSVT), respectively, accounted for 23% and 14% of the etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous midazolam terminated NCSE in 19 patients and valproate in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic NCSE, 4 (18%) had poor prognosis (3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The etiological risk factors in the 9 (41%) patients with excellent outcome included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (3), remote symptomatic (2), cryptogenic (1), and metabolic and drugs (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of NCSE in the current study was comparable with those in prior reports from developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011450'>CNS infections</z:hpo> accounted for about a fifth of the etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Outcome was excellent in patients with nonacute symptomatic NCSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Initial 60-min EmEEG may be performed in establishing the diagnosis of NCSE, but almost half of patients with NCSE will be missed with this approach </plain></SENT>
