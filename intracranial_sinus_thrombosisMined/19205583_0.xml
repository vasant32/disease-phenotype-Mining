<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the efficacy of deep temporalis fascia and its pedicled flap in 34 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective study method was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 34 cases, 19 males and 13 females, the age ranged between 5 and 64 years, mean of 28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical pathology included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> which was common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, others are middle ear <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> in 7, mastoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> 6, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> 4, lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity factors included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in 2, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in 3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicaemia</z:e> in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedures comprised of 18 modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) and 8 atticoantrostomy (AA) with lining of the resulting cavity and tympanoplasty using a pedicled temporalis fascia flap; and 8 cortical mastoidectomy (CM) and tympanoplasty using a graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The success rate in terms of control of otorrhoea was 55% and there was no case of postoperative wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, an improvement compared to an earlier report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition there was a reduction in terms of postoperative hospital stay to an average of 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found the technique simple to learn and needing minimal equipment, hence relevant to otolaryngologic practice in a resource--poor environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition the deep temporalis fascia is an autologous tissue with no risk of immune rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend that mastoid reconstruction with the temporalis fascia becomes a routine in mastoidectomy so as to achieve control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> discharging ear, particularly in the sub-Saharan Africa where this is still predominant </plain></SENT>
