<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To establish an experimental model of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> using a transvenous route, and thrombin and balloon occlusion, in pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The SSS was catheterized transvenously in six pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombin was injected into the pigs' SSS to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) confirmed successful SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI and MRV were also used to observe the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and accompanying brain parenchymal changes before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> induction postoperatively on Days 1, 3, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pigs were sacrificed for histological examination at the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was successfully achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On Day 1 postoperatively, MRV confirmed SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and MRI revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On Day 3, venous infarction was noted in two cases, one of which appeared to be hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, MRV showed partial recanalization of the SSS in one pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was significantly relieved in four cases while, in two other cases, the extent of venous infarction was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histological examination confirmed SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, with recanalization in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In two of the animals, bilateral parasagittal infarction was seen, including one with petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the other four animals, bilateral parasagittal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The development of an experimental model of SSS via the transvenous route is feasible in pigs using thrombin and balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This model closely resembles SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in humans, and can be applied in the clinical study of this phenomenon as well as in clinical therapeutic applications </plain></SENT>
