<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to collect data of epidemiological, clinical and prognostic features of pneumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in children treated at Szent László Hospital, Budapest, Hungary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical charts and follow-up records of patients aged 1 to 18 years admitted to our Pediatric and Pediatric Intensive Care Units due to pneumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> between 1st Jan 1998 and 30th Jun 2007 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequent clinical symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (100%), nuchal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (78%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> (71%), Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs (58%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>Otitis media</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> were present in 44%, 58%, 41%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subdural effusion, parenchymal cerebral lesion and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were documented in 5, 3 and 2 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One third of the patients received ceftriaxon, two thirds were administered ceftriaxon and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> was given to 91% of the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>70% of patients required mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>9 patients (25%) required endoscopic sinus surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 13 cases (38%) mastoidectomy, in 5 children (15%) neurosurgery was performed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>8 (23.5%) patients had mild or moderate, 1 child (3%) developed severe neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in children remains a source of substantial morbidity and mortality in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The long hospital stay, the frequent need for intensive care and severe neurologic sequelae emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, early treatment and prevention with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines </plain></SENT>
