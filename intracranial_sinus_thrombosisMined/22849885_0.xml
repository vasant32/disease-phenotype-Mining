<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They can be treated by arterial or venous embolization, by surgery or by the combination of both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transvenous approach induces venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> increasing the risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases of transvenous embolization of lateral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> treated in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our main objective is to evaluate the clinical/imaging results of this treatment and the second goal is to discuss possible advantages of the subocclusive approach in the first session of transvenous treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors present six clinical cases of DAVF with the following clinical symptoms: visual disturbances (3); ear pulsatile bruit (3); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (2); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (1); subjective hearing loss (1); optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (1); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic classification was: Cognard IIa, (3), IIab (2) e IV (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the lateral sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main afferent branches arised from: ipsilateral ECA (6); ipsilateral ICA (6); ipsilateral VA (6); contralateral ECA (5); contralateral VA (5); contralateral ICA (3); ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transarterial approach was the first approach in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with satisfactory but transient results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was always followed by transvenous embolization of the lateral sinus with GDC coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subocclusive approach was achieved in five patients with the persistence of some afferent arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography in four of them showed "spontaneous" <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the lateral sinus with clinical and angiographic cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> occurred once during the initial transvenous procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no complications or new neurological signs or symptoms in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transvenous treatment of DAVF has led to technical and clinical success without procedure complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We think that subocclusive approach of the venous sinus with coils can cause less hemodynamic changes with a slower <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate and less complications, unchanging the angiographic and clinical resolution </plain></SENT>
