<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> to document: (1) incidence of intracranial complications; (2) risk factors; and (3) identify pathologic organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of children at a tertiary care children's hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> from July, 1986 through June, 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 118 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (6.8%), ages 20 months to 14 years, had intracranial complications related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three children had a sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, two children had an epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, and two children had both complications of sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, and a sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> was present in one child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-admission oral antibiotics were administered for an average of 10 days in seven of the eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persistent otorrhea and/or otalgia were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative cultures were negative in four cases (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Organisms isolated included: Streptococcus pneumoniae (2); Proteus mirabilis (1); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1); and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multi-drug resistant organisms were documented in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a contrast enhanced CT of the temporal bones and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical management included complete mastoidectomy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and a pressure equalization tube in seven of the eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our review did not document an increase in the incidence of otitic intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Persistent otalgia or otorrhea while on oral antibiotics with associated neurologic symptoms are ominous signs suggestive of a complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Multi-drug resistant organisms are uncommon whereas negative intraoperative cultures are common </plain></SENT>
