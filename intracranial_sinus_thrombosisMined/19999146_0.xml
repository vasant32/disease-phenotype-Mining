<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old man presented with a 12-day history of severe non-throbbing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He showed no physical abnormality but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On day 12, ring-shaped low intensity lesions inside straight sinus were revealed on T2*-weighted MRI image (T2*WI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the following day (day 13), he was found unresponsive at home, and ambulated with disturbed consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FLAIR and diffusion-weighted MRI image disclosed high intensity signals in bilateral thalamus which were postulated as vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and conventional cerebral angiography showed an absence of flow in inferior sagittal sinus, vein of Galen, and straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings confirmed the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment was introduced and his consciousness level was gradually improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 43, he was discharged with no neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A delay of correct diagnosis and treatment with CVT can lead to devastating disability or even to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An early diagnosis of CVT is often dismissed owing to the nonspecific symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recent reports described high sensitivity of T2*WI for detecting CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alterations in blood flow and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> reduced products, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, in thrombosed veins often produce the magnetic susceptibility on T2*WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A detection of ring-shaped low intensity lesions within venous sinus on T2*WI were quite rare, and the signal changes of these sinus lesions were successfully visualized by chronological T2*WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our case implies that T2*WI is the powerful tool for the early detection of CVT, even before the critical symptoms might happen </plain></SENT>
