<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and recurrent aura-like episodes can occur in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA), which has been the presumed cause in the majority of reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this syndrome can occur following cSAH secondary to other conditions, and it is important for clinicians to investigate and manage such patients appropriately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We describe two patients who presented with recurrent stereotyped transient neurological symptoms in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cSAH identified on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, SAH occurred secondary to cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other, SAH was due to extension of a traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Conditions other than CAA can cause the clinicoradiological syndrome of cSAH with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-like events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gradient echo or susceptibility-weighted imaging should be included in the diagnostic work-up of patients presenting with such events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When cSAH is detected, the full differential diagnosis for this should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aetiologies other than CAA can cause this syndrome and management can vary greatly depending on the underlying cause </plain></SENT>
