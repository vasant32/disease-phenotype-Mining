<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient was a 63-year-old man who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance venography was performed and suggested dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left transverse sinus and jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was administered <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation therapy but then suffered multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A DS angiogram was requested for a possible dural sinus thrombectomy, but the DS angiogram revealed a DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent serial liquid embolization with complete obliteration of the DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second patient, an 11-year-old boy, also presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and was diagnosed with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A DS angiogram was also requested for a possible thrombectomy and revealed a DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient underwent serial liquid embolization and eventual operative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These reports emphasize that different venous flow abnormalities can appear similar on noninvasive imaging and that proper diagnosis is critical to avoid contraindicated therapies </plain></SENT>
