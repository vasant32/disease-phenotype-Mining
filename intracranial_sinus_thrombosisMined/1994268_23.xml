<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The period of continuous infusion for thrombolysis ranged between 4 and 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the clinical signs and symptoms improved with angiographic evidence of clot lysis and dural sinus recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography indicated that one patient had a partial resolution of a clot in the torcular herophili and transverse sinus but showed no clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results suggest that transjugular local infusion of thrombolytic agents can be an effective treatment for symptomatic, thrombosed dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This selective lysis avoids thrombolytic effects that could aggravate or produce systemic hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
