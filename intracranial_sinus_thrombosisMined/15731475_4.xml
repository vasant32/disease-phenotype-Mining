<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Based on a newly developed model of reversible superior sagittal sinus (SSS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the rat, we investigated the effect of thrombolytic and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment on recanalization, brain parenchymal changes, and motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the SSS was induced by topical application of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occlusion was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six hours after operation, single treatment with 10 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)/kg and 6 mg abciximab/kg or subcutaneous injection of 450 IU/kg enoxaparin twice daily was started, each group containing 10 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI with T2- and diffusion-weighted images was performed on the first, second, and seventh postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Control and enoxaparin-treated animals developed diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> without infarction or <z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>intracerebral bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was indicated by an increase of T2 relaxation time and a decrease of the apparent diffusion coefficient in the parasagittal and lateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these groups, the degree of recanalization after 7 days was comparable (48% versus 52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enoxaparin-treated animals showed significant amelioration of functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was best in the abciximab-treated group, with a residual sinus occlusion of 36% after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Highest recanalization was achieved by lysis with rtPA (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Enoxaparin treatment in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> significantly influences clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it has no effect on recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>GPIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and rtPA accelerate thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They may represent an alternative in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
