<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary TCH is diagnosed when no underlying cause is discovered; however, imaging is crucial in distinguishing secondary causes, which are wide-ranging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The radiologist should be aware of the list of potential diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is the most common cause of secondary TCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmal SAH accounts for the majority of cases, although other causes should also be considered and these include perimesencephalic haemorrhage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, and dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> as well as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditions that may present with TCH, with or without SAH include cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> and cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging features are reviewed with reference to clues gleaned from initial imaging using computed tomography, as well as characteristics that should be sought using magnetic resonance imaging or angiographic imaging </plain></SENT>
