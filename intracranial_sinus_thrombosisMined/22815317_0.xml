<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients with evidence of CVST and thirty-five controls with similar baseline characteristics were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CVST patients were further divided into two subgroups based on the presence or absence of parenchymal lesions in cranial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our analyses revealed a significant difference in MPV and PDW values between CVST patients with lesions and controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MPV and PDW values were significantly increased in CVST patients with brain parenchmal lesions, suggesting that MPV and PDW values can be used to predict the severity of CVST </plain></SENT>
