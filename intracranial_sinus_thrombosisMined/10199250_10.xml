<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 4-year period 69 patients underwent surgery in which six variations of the extreme-lateral craniocervical approach were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variations included: the transfacetal approach (TFA), performed to treat four lesions in the upper cervical spine anterior or anterolateral to the spinal cord; the retrocondylar approach, to treat five intradural lesions located anterolateral to the medulla oblongata and six vascular lesions to expose the extradural segment of the vertebral artery (VA); the partial transcondylar approach (PTCA), to treat 18 intradural lesions located anterior to the medulla oblongata; the complete transcondylar approach (CTCA), to treat 13 extradural lesions that involved the lower clivus and anterior upper cervical spine; the extreme-lateral transjugular approach, to treat 14 jugular foramen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; and the transtubercular approach with or without division of the sigmoid sinus, to treat complex VA and vertebrobasilar junction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An anatomical prosection was performed to study the surgical exposure of each of the six variations of the extreme-lateral craniocervical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total removal was achieved in 35 (69%) of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>; subtotal resection was achieved in 16 (31%) of those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 12 patients with VA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, seven underwent clipping, three underwent trapping and a vein graft bypass procedure, and two underwent trapping without the use of a bypass procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five other patients, different cystic, inflammatory, and other vascular lesions were successfully treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the patients who underwent surgery via the TFA, 83% via the of the CTCA, and 11% via the PTCA required an occipitocervical fusion procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean Karnofsky Performance Scale score was 74.7 preoperatively and 76.4 postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (nine patients), cerebrospinal fluid leakage (seven patients), worsened cranial nerve function (seven patients), vertebrobasilar vasospasm (one patient), and sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To treat lesions in the region of the foramen magnum and surrounding areas, the approach should be tailored to each specific lesion to provide the needed exposure without unnecessary operative steps </plain></SENT>
