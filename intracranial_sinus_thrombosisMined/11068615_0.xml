<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, an essential element is the unilateral nature of painful symptoms and purulent rhinorrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When symptoms are bilateral, antibiotics should not be prescribed except when the condition has not been resolved by symptomatic treatment during several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In such cases, other important discriminating factors are also examination showing pus originating from below the middle meatus or sinusal X-ray showing a liquid level or a total opacity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presently the choice of antibiotic tends toward products active on both Haemophilus producing beta-lactamase and on pneumococci with reduced sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> having only a low level of resistance </plain></SENT>
