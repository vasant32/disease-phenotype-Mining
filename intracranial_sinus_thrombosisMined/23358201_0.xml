<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experts affirm that enoxaparin has become in the drug of choice for DVT therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite this, there is a little information regarding the optimal dose schedule for enoxaparin therapy in children and the therapeutic guidelines for enoxaparin use in children are extrapolated from adult guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monitoring by antifactor Xa (anti-Xa) measurement and target concentrations between 0.5-1 U/ml at 4-6 h postdose are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to analyse our experience in paediatric-specific dosage requirements for enoxaparin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was performed with patients less than 16 years old, who were treated with enoxaparin for DVT and monitored by anti-Xa concentration, between January 2005 and March 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were analyzed: boy/girl ratio, 8/4; median age, 3.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was the most common indication for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risks factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dose increases were necessary only in patients less than 6 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Target anti-Xa concentrations were achieved in 12 (85%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Children younger than 1 year required a higher dose of enoxaparin/kg (1.5-2.7 mg/kg per 12 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complete resolutions of DVT were registered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean number of dose increases was three and a median of 11 days to achieve target anti-Xa concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that an initial higher enoxaparin dose may be necessary in neonates and infants, but other factors must be considered to improve management </plain></SENT>
