<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In trauma practice, basilar skull fracture is an extremely common finding while transverse/sigmoid venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is generally considered quite a rare complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During evaluation of cervical computed tomography (CT) angiography after trauma, we identified five patients in just three months with unexpected transverse/sigmoid venous sinus obstruction ipsilateral to a basilar skull fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This number represented a surprisingly high percentage of our neurosurgical trauma consults for the study period (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of the five patients were found to have sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>: two with right transverse/sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> experienced significant neurological deficits and prolonged hospital courses even with anti-coagulation therapy; one patient with a left transverse/sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had a good outcome with anti-coagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other two of the five patients had outflow obstruction, likely from focal epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and extrinsic compression: one patient with partial obstruction in the right transverse-sigmoid junction, due to epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, experienced a difficult recovery; one patient with a right sigmoid sinus obstruction presented and remained asymptomatic and experienced a benign hospital course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the five patients had a posterior temporal hemorrhagic area ipsilateral to the affected sinus, suggesting that this finding may have represented hemorrhagic venous infarction rather than traumatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that a basilar skull fracture in the region of temporal or occipital bone should be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of transverse/sigmoid venous sinus obstruction and may be an under-recognized and treatable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Failure to detect this complication may explain, in part, unexpected clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
