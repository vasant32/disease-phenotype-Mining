<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A positive correlation between HCT and CT attenuation of intravascular blood has long been assumed but has never been established by using substantial patient numbers and modern CT equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether apparent increased attenuation on CT in cerebral venous sinuses can be attributed to hemoconcentration alone and to assess whether sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can be differentiated from hemoconcentrated blood based on attenuation values alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured HUs in a region of interest within the confluence of dural venous sinuses in 166 unenhanced head CTs and correlated these data with HCT and HGB values in male and female patients aged 2 to 100 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then compared these data with similar measurements in 8 patients with recent venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-tailed t test and linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate HGB and HCT between groups and with measured CT attenuation of intravascular blood, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant relationship was noted between both HCT and HGB with CT attenuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of 8 patients with sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had attenuation values &gt;70, but none of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects had HUs &gt;70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemoconcentration correlates with CT attenuation in cerebral venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that comparing the ratio of HUs to HCT may be useful in gauging concern for sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
