<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two cases of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (DAVM) of the posterior fossa were presented and a histopathological examination was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After embolization of the feeding arteries, DAVMs of the posterior fossa were removed with the adjacent sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial sections of the surgical specimens showed an abnormal mass with dilated, tortuous vessels of varying diameters in the sinus wall, and partially hyalinized connective tissue around the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elastic lamina of the sinus wall was interrupted and a mass of abnormal vessels developed into the subintimal layer of the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>Fistulas</z:mpath>, about 200 microns in diameter, were formed between arterialized dural veins and dural arteries which had obvious internal elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An opening of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> of the abnormal vessel, 25 microns in diameter, to the sinus lumen was also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No stage of organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> could be seen in the sinus lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggested that physiologically existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> within the dura mater, which have been reported by Kerber et al, had developed due to many factors which increase intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They protruded into the sinus lumen in such a way that it could cause stenosis or obstruction of the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion it can be said that an obstructive lesion of dural sinus is considered of itself to be DAVM in most cases and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is the result of the DAVM </plain></SENT>
