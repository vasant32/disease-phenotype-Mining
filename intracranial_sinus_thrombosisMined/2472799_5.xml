<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were born at term with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> diagnosed in the neonatal period, were retrospectively identified and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was determined by unenhanced computed tomography which demonstrated a dense sagittal sinus with concomitant small ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had ancillary studies (i.e., cerebral angiography and nuclear flow scan) which confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 4 patients had evidence of perinatal asphyxia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients were identified as having associated conditions known to predispose them to dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients tested had an identifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were the initial presentation in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> predominantly occurred during the first week of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent examinations were available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 patients and ranged up to 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 3 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> beyond the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 12 infants with no history of perinatal asphyxia, neurodevelopmental outcomes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two of 4 infants with perinatal asphyxia had neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> represents an important and under-recognized cause of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in term infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the absence of perinatal asphyxia, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuro-developmental outcome is likely and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> recurrence is low </plain></SENT>
