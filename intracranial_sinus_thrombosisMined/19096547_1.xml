<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 66-year-old woman presented with a one month history of progressive occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography angiography and cerebral angiography showed a round filling defect at the transverse sinus which was speculated as a transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy was performed to prevent worsening of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> for 2 weeks and then a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The filling defect lesion at the transverse sinus revealed a non-enhancing granule with central linear enhancement, which was compatible with giant arachnoid granulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We checked the intrasinus pressure difference across the lesion the through the dural sinus in order to exclude the lesion as the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> venous pressure with no significant differential pressure across the lesion was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was treated with medical therapy </plain></SENT>
