<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients presented with an ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo>, which extended to involve the brain stem in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myelography and magnetic resonance imaging showed slightly dilated spinal perimedullary vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spinal angiograms were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the arterial phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was only possible after cerebral angiography, which demonstrated posterior fossa AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> fed by meningeal arteries and draining into spinal perimedullary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment alone resulted in angiographic obliteration of the lesion in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients required surgery in addition to endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died postoperatively, and in one a transient complication of embolization was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvement after treatment was good in two cases and fair in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was observed in three cases and was probably the cause of the aberrant venous drainage of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> into the spinal perimedullary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology is related to spinal cord venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These lesions were classified as Type 5 in the Djindjian and Merland classification of dural intracranial AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy is a safe effective method in the treatment of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> and should be tried first </plain></SENT>
