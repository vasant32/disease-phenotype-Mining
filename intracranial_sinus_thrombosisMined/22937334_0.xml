<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although we do not know the exact incidence and prevalence of CVST, it is an important diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, it has been diagnosed more frequently due to greater awareness and availability of noninvasive diagnostic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, routine diagnostic neuroimaging has been used to monitor the clinical progress of these patients, especially in deteriorating cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to decrease morbidity and mortality, an understanding of CVST treatment options is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of extensive intracranial venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with intrasinus infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is relatively controversial as there are no clear guidelines in regards to appropriate therapeutic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report a case of successful intrasinus thrombolysis of deep cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (DCST) resulting in rapid radiographic improvement associated with complete clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
