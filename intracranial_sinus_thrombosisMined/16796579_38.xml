<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is still frequently overlooked or delayed due to the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and the often <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or lingering <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current therapeutic measures which are used in clinical practice include the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> such as dose-adjusted intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or body weight-adjusted subcutaneous low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH), the use of thrombolysis, and symptomatic therapy including control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Library to review the strength of evidence to support these interventions and the preparation of recommendations on the therapy of CVST based on the best available evidence </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recommendations were reached by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Where there was a lack of evidence, but consensus was clear we stated our opinion as good practice points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with CVST without contraindications for anticoagulation should be treated either with body weight-adjusted subcutaneous LMWH or dose-adjusted intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (good practice point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitant intracranial haemorrhage related to CVST is not a contraindication for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Oral anticoagulation may be given for 3 months if CVST was secondary to a transient risk factor, for 6-12 months in patients with idiopathic CVST and in those with 'mild' hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Indefinite anticoagulation (AC) should be considered in patients with two or more episodes of CVST and in those with one episode of CVST and 'severe' hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (good practice point) </plain></SENT>
