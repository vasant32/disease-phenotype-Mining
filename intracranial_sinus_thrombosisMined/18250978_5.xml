<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We report the rapid treatment of CVST in six patients at high risk for poor outcomes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency) using rheolytic thrombectomy combined with locally administered low-dose recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), and review the literature on rheolytic thrombectomy for CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the procedures were technically successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced partial rethrombosis following rheolytic thrombectomy requiring a second treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preexisting hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in two patients remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of six patients experienced excellent clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two had good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from irreversible cerebral injury caused by extensive CVST that had occurred prior to the endovascular treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 24 cases of rheolytic thrombectomy for CVST that were reviewed from this series and previously published reports, the large majority of patients experienced good to excellent clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extensive CVST in high-risk patients can be rapidly fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rheolytic thrombectomy combined with locally administered, low-dose recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is a safe and effective endovascular method to rapidly recanalize the intracranial dural sinuses in high-risk patients with CVST </plain></SENT>
