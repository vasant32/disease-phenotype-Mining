<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the presentations, treatments, and outcomes of neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> and to assess infarction as a predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary pediatric hospital in Indianapolis, Ind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients Forty-two children with neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code searches from 1986 through June 2005 and review of neurology clinic records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, motor impairment, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> at last clinic visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gestational or delivery complications or risk factors and comorbid conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> were common (gestational/delivery factors in 82% [31 of 38 with available maternal data]; comorbid conditions in 62% [26 of the 42]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four (57%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five (60%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, which were hemorrhagic in 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 27 (64%) of 42 received prothrombotic evaluations; none had persistent deficiencies of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three (7%) received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other children received only supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One child died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Outcome data were available for 29 (71%) of the 41 survivors; of these, 23 (79%) had impairment(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two were known to be in early intervention, and no further information was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 27, 16 (59%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, 18 (67%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, and 11 (41%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Infarction was associated with the presence of later impairment (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> is often nonspecific, the diagnosis can be difficult to make, treatment beyond supportive care is rarely used, and outcomes can be severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to develop standardized guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
