<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a superacute change of the blood-brain barrier in a rat experimental model of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> produced by an embolic occlusion of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> thirty-seven animals received retrograde embolization, marked increments of SSS pressure were noted immediately after embolic occlusion of the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity and geographical patterns of the disruption of blood-brain barrier were then analyzed photomicrographically, visualized by the autofluorescence of the exuded Evans blue with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relationship between the degree of SSS pressure increment and the severity of the blood-brain barrier destruction was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ten out of the seventeen animals (59%), analyzed five minutes after embolization, exudation of the dye was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of SSS pressure increment in the animals with dye exudation was higher than in the animals without them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five out of the nine animals (56%), analyzed fifteen minutes after embolization, exudation of the dye was also demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of SSS pressure increments in the animals with dye exudation was statistically higher than those in the non-exuded ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Especially, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals with SSS pressure higher than 75 mmHg were associated with severe exudation of the dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The exudation of the dye was more prominent in the white matter than in the cortical gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Following pathological analysis have revealed that exudation of the dye was most prominent around the capillary and the venule in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Microvacuolation around these vessels was also noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
