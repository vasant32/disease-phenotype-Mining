<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we describe a case of CVST accompanied by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_252'>oligodendroglioma</z:mpath> and pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our patient, the following factors contributed to the formation of CVST: First, the pregnancy state, which is a known risk factor for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>; and secondly, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_252'>oligodendroglioma</z:mpath> could have changed the architecture of adjacent sinus (right lateral sinus) and provocation of the development of clot in the sinus </plain></SENT>
