<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These procedures require long examination times and processing of imaging data by computing maximum intensity projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional phase-contrast projection angiography has neither of these disadvantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the value of this technique for head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in 84 patients and 15 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined to resolve specific clinical questions such as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (20 cases), patency of carotid and vertebral arteries (35 cases), patency of the superior sagittal sinus (14 cases), patency of saphenous vein bypass grafts (11 cases), and vascularity of masses (four cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiograms were available for correlation in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional phase-contrast projection angiograms were generated by using a gradient-recalled-echo sequence sensitized to flow with the use of flow-encoding gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Projection <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms were obtained in approximately 3.5 min by combining images obtained with flow-encoding gradients applied along the axes defining the image plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms were subjectively evaluated by three observers without reference to routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images or conventional angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-quality studies were obtained in 93% of control subjects and 90% of patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings based on phase-contrast angiography were confirmed with conventional angiography in 21 of 22 patients for whom conventional angiograms were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of vascular grafts and of the patency of major cranial vessels was easily done with two-dimensional phase-contrast angiography and was useful in postoperative follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also advocate its use for superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and follow-up examinations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
