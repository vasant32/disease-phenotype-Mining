<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review clinical informations including general informations, general performances, and ocular presentations of 118 inpatients with CVST in the general hospital of chinese people's liberation army during 2005-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ocular symptoms as the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> presentations or simultaneous phenomenon among different <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the CVST patients, 21.2% (25/118) presented with ocular symptom as the initial presentation, 30.5% (36/118) presented with ocular symptom as well as the other symptoms, and 48.3% (57/118) presented with non-ocular symptoms as the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CVST patients were divided into 3 groups according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no marked statistical significance among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common major complaints were blurring and degeneration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vision, accounting for 85.9% (61/71) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormal ocular chief complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common objective sign in eyes was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e>, accounting for 48.3% (57/118) in this group of CVST patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About 22.4% (13/58) showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vision deterioration at 1-year follow-up, due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As ophthalmologists, we should master the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> characteristics and clinical manifestations of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and treatment is very important for the prevention of vision deterioration, especially for patients with ocular syndrome as the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For isolated agnogenic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, we should consider the possibility of CVST </plain></SENT>
