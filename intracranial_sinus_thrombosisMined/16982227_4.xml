<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the risk for cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) may be greater among users of the contraceptive patch than among users of oral contraceptives (OCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the PharMetrics database, we identified women aged 15-44 years who filled at least one prescription for either the contraceptive patch or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi>-containing, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi>-containing or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi>-containing OCs to assess the risk of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The person-time of current exposure to each study drug, as well as the incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of CVST, was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified over 1 million users of the four study drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were five cases of CVST among current users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi>, seven cases among current users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi>, two cases among current users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi> and none among current users of the contraceptive patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IRs per 100,000 woman-years were 2.7 [95% confidence interval (95% CI)=0.9-6.3], 1.6 (95% CI=0.7-3.3), 0.7 (95% CI=0.1-2.4) and 0.0 (95% CI=0.0-4.8), respectively, in users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi> and the contraceptive patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were two women who had CVST while not currently taking a hormonal contraceptive (IR=0.4 per 100,000 woman-years; 95% CI=0.1-1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IRRs were 4.0 (95% CI=0.7-42.4) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi>-containing versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi>-containing OCs, and 2.4 (95% CI=0.5-24.0) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi>-containing versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi>-containing OCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IRR for the patch could not be calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of an increased risk of CVST in users of the contraceptive patch compared to users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi>-containing OCs </plain></SENT>
