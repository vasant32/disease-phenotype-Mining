<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Clinical presentation and etiology of localized nontraumatic convexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (cSAH) have been described in a few patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They differ from those of aneurysmal subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> which is diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, the radiologic findings and causes of cSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected patients admitted to the neurology department of CHU of Nîmes or Montpellier, from May 2008 to May 2011, who presented with cSAH, observed in a single cortical sulcus unrelated to trauma and identified on brain MRI T2* weighted images as a hyposignal in one sulcus of the convexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collection was retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (14 men and nine women) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 69.5years (range 29-86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients had mostly sensory or sensorimotor deficits which was regressive in less than 30minutes, recurrent, and seldom accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI allowed the identification of patients with old brain <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (n=2), lobar microbleeds (n=7) and superficial cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The etiologic diagnosis was determined in 43% (n=10/23): <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (n=3), reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (n=2), primary cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> (n=1), posterior reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (n=1), cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=3, two of them associated with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed in 11 patients and gave the etiologic diagnosis (<z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp>, cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available for 16 patients (mean 12months, range 3months to 5years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Etiology was established during follow-up in two patients, both had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> diagnosed after recurrent lobar <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: cSAH has various causes, but clinical presentations appear to be relatively stereotyped with recurrent and brief episodes of sensorimotor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive assessment and monitoring would lead to an etiologic diagnosis in some patients </plain></SENT>
