<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial side occlusion leads to recurrence, while venous side occlusion leads to permanent cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vein of Galen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> embrace some features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s), namely a reticulum, and some features of dural fistulae, namely evidence of previous sinus anomaly and direct drainage into a sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are also permanently cured by venous side <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, although the dangers inherent in their reticulum demand that this be done in stages or preceded by arterial side embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A very limited experience with venous end occlusion of cerebral (and spinal) <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s suggests that they, too, can be permanently cured by venous side occlusion without excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their reticulum demands maximum, multistage, preliminary arterial side embolization together with intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> during the venous occlusion stage in order to minimize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Schematic models of both fistulae and malformations are presented, together with reasons why particulate embolization is safer than glue embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The theory is advanced that dural fistulae, vein of Galen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s are venous- rather than arterial-based lesions, which is consistent with the experience that permanent cure has been effected by venous side occlusion without excision in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that there may be a developmental link between <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> and the venous malformation, the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> being essentially a fistulized venous malformation </plain></SENT>
