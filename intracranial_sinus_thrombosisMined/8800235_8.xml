<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report our experience with transfemoral direct venous thrombolysis and angioplasty to treat central venous and dural sinus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cases presented are rare examples of internal jugular occlusion associated with sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two middle-aged, symptomatic female patients were diagnosed with sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Venography was performed from a contralateral transfemoral approach, followed immediately by urokinase infusion directly to the occlusion using an intermittent "burst-bolus" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful thrombolysis of the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein was documented in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case, a venous stenosis was treated with balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs and symptoms resolved in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Occluded dural sinuses and central veins can be treated with direct administration of thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When an underlying stenosis is identified, balloon dilation should be used to reduce the likelihood of recurrence </plain></SENT>
