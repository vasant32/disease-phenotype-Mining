<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to explore associations in a cohort of 59 neonates with sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most (66%) came to medical attention within 48 hours of birth (defined as early presentation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most (88%) had multiple comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>Respiratory distress</z:hpo> (P = 0.005), <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (P = 0.02), poor tone (P = 0.05), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> (P = 0.044), and low Apgar score (P = 0.018) were associated with early presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> was associated with late presentation (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time of presentation was not associated with radiographic severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presentation with difficult-to-control <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was marginally associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (P = 0.096) but no other measure of radiographic severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neonates with sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> often present within 48 hours, with multiple comorbidities and presenting signs, some of which are associated with time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither timing of presentation nor presence or absence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> can be used to predict findings on radiographic imaging </plain></SENT>
