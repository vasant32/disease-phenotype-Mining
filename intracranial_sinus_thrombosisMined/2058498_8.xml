<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The VIGRE sequence consists of a rapid single-slice acquisition, 50/15/2 (TR/TE/excitations), and 30 degrees flip angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At each slice position, a total of four images were reconstructed; these consisted of one magnitude image and three images sensitive to proton motion in each orthogonal direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The flow direction and flow velocity (cm/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>) were obtained from each of the phase images, and results were correlated with data obtained from a phantom experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, dural sinus velocities ranged from a mean of 9.9 to 14.4 cm/sec for the transverse and superior sagittal sinuses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients with proved dural sinus occlusion were studied with spin-echo images at 1.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was also performed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of dural sinus occlusion was determined by the lack of flow void on the spin-echo images, the absence of phase shift on the VIGRE study, and the presence of retrograde flow on the phase image in the sinus proximal to the occluded segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Time-of-flight angiography overestimated the extent of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> caused by spin saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up VIGRE studies detected the formation of collateral flow in one patient and recanalization with the establishment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antegrade sinus flow in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that phase-sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is helpful in establishing the diagnosis and extent of dural sinus occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
