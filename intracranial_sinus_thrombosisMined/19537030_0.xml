<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 168 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> underwent individualized endovascular treatment: direct thrombolysis via internal jugular vein in 26 cases, injection of urokinase via common carotid artery in 98 cases, stent angioplasty in venous sinus in 9, simple <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in 20 cases, and treating combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> simultaneously in 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was conducted for 6-168 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up showed that the effective rate was 97.6%, recurrence rate was 6.6%, complication incidence rate was 1.2%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous sinus recanalization occurred and primary drainage rebounded in most eases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lateral drainage was strengthened in some cases whose venous sinuses did not recover ideally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The symptoms of most cases were alleviated along with the decrease of intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Individualized endovascular treatment based on the characteristics of the disease is effective in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
