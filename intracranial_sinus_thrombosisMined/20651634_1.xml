<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It was recently suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is an almost universal finding after hemicraniectomy and that early cranioplasty may prevent the need for permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To conduct a study in an attempt to verify these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy for medically refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> between 2001 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, or head trauma were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>Hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was classified as internal or external and as clinically significant or asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient population consisted of 17 patients, 8 men and 9 women, with a median age of 44 years (range, 27-53 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Etiologies included malignant middle cerebral artery territory infarction in 12 patients, hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> in 2 patients, dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 2 patients, and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of craniectomy ranged from a large bone flap in 4 patients to a standard hemicraniectomy in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients died and 1 was lost to follow-up during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining 14 patients underwent cranioplasty after a median interval of 21 days (range, 3-42 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In none of these patients did clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> develop requiring cerebrospinal fluid diversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid collections developed in 2 patients that resolved spontaneously after cranioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, contrary to some beliefs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> does not frequently occur after decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
