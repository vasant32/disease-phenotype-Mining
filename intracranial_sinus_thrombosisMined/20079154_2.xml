<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to prospectively investigate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance venography (MRV) in the evaluation of the recanalization of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study prospectively evaluated the diagnostic performance of 2-dimensional time-of-flight (2D-TOF) MRV in thirty-two consecutive patients during a three- to six-month follow-up for CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both 2D-TOF MRV and digital substraction angiography (DSA) were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy of 2D-TOF MRV in the detection of recanalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was evaluated using DSA as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRV and DSA were completed without complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 2D-TOF MRV for the detection of recanalization on a segmental basis were 91% (62/68), 93% (37/40), 95% (62/65), and 86% (37/43) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 2D-TOF MRV provides high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of recanalized CVST segments </plain></SENT>
