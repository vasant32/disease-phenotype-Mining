<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: The authors searched the English literature on CVST from 1990 to 2012 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case reports or case series of mechanical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: A total of 64 patients were treated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The techniques for mechanical thrombectomy included rheolytic thrombectomy with an AngioJet device (46.9%), clot retraction with the Penumbra system (4.7%), clot retraction with a Fogarty catheter (1.6%), clot retraction with a microsnare (3.1%), balloon venoplasty without stenting (18.7%), balloon venoplasty with stenting (4.7%), and an amalgam of techniques (18.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine (16.1%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the most recent follow-up, 40 (62.5%) patients had no disability or minor disability and 7 (10.9%) patients had major disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Randomized multiinstitutional clinical trials with larger number of participants are needed to sufficiently compare the effect of intrasinus thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy to standard-of-care anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
