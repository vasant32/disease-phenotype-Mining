<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic drugs are widely used for the management of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several in vitro models have been developed to study clot lytic activity of thrombolytic drugs, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these have certain limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is need of an appropriate model to check the clot lytic efficacy of thrombolytic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, an attempt has been made to design and develop a new model system to study clot lysis in a simplified and easy way using a thrombolytic drug, streptokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Whole blood from healthy individuals (n = 20) was allowed to form clots in a pre-weighed <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> microcentrifuge tubes; serum was removed and clot was weighed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After lysis by streptokinase fluid was removed and remnants of clot were again weighed along with the tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentage of Clot lysis was calculated on the basis of the weight difference of microcentrifuge tubes obtained before and after clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant percentage of clot lysis observed when streptokinase was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand with water (negative control), minimal (2.5%) clot lysis was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between clot lysis done by streptokinase and water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study could be a rapid and effective methodology to study clot-lytic effect of newly developed drugs as well as known drugs </plain></SENT>
