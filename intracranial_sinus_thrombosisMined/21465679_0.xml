<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous authors reported the association between CCHS and central sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CSVT) and hypothesized that CCHS could be secondary to CSVT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assume that effects, secondary to CCHS, upon the central venous system may explain the etiological connection between CSVT and CCHS including dysautoregulation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
