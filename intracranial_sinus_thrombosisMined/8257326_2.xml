<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None had any prior known intracerebral pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging scans were done on a 0.5 T unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with an average age of 35 years had angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVM) found by MRI (one with biopsy confirmation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo>, three of three cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary tumour</z:e>, one case of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with haemorrhagic infarction, one of two cases of venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> were detected by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progress computed tomography scans discovered two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> and angiography found a venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> and an arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> undetected by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that MRI scanning is helpful in detecting underlying AOVM as a cause of intracerebral haemorrhage but its role in imaging haemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
