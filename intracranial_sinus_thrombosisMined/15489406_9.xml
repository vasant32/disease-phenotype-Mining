<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the characteristics of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (AVFs) with or without cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CST), and to analyse the determinants of aggressive manifestations in patients with dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 69 patients aged 51.4 (SD 15) years who were diagnosed as having dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the location of the lesion and venous drainage pattern, dural AVF was classified into three sites (cavernous sinus, large sinus, and other) and five types (by Cognard's method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aggressive manifestations of dural AVF were defined as intracranial haemorrhage, venous infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e>, and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CST was based on cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression methods were used to analyse the determinants of aggressive manifestation in patients with dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CST was found in 39% of the patients with dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was located at almost either the sinus around the dural AVF or the downstream venous flow pathways of the dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference with regard to sex, location, or type of dural AVF between patients with dural AVF with and without CST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The location "other sinuses" and the type of dural AVF "IIb/IIa+b/III/IV/V" were significantly related to aggressive manifestations of dural AVF (odds ratio 19 (p = 0.001) and 5.63 (p = 0.033), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Presence of CST in patients with dural AVF had an odds ratio of 4.25 (p = 0.12) for development of aggressive manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CST affects two fifths of patients with dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The location and type of dural AVF are major determinants of aggressive manifestations in patients with dural AVF </plain></SENT>
