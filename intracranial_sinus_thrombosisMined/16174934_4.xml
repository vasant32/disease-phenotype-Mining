<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although anticoagulation (AC) reduces the risk of a fatal outcome or severe disability in patients with cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST), prognosis of severe cases is still difficult to predict </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors studied the clinical course of patients with CVST who died despite AC therapy to look for clinical features that might explain the lethal course of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a series of 79 consecutive patients with CVST who were treated with a standard regimen of dose-adjusted iv <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case histories of patients with a fatal outcome are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors identified eight patients with a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were stuporous or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> at the start of AC, and four patients showed markedly delayed intracranial circulation times, indicating extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients improved, but deteriorated secondarily after reduction or discontinuation of AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sufficient activated partial thromboplastin time levels were reached only after a delay in three patients, and critical deterioration occurred in two of them during this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although inadequate AC may have contributed to the fatal outcome, some patients with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> who are stuporous or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> at the start of AC may carry an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, despite <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More aggressive treatment approaches, such as endovascular thrombolysis, may be needed for this subgroup of patients with CVST </plain></SENT>
