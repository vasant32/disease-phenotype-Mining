<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> commonly presents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and rarely with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These thromboses can progress to neurologic impairment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We are sharing recent clinical experiences with these thromboses as they present to the otologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the presentation, physical examination, and imaging studies of 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four women had thrombotic occlusion of the sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their only symptoms were focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients, and unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> in 2 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imaging studies had to be repeated or alternative testing performed in order to conclusively identify the problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is important to be vigilant for the possibility of sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in women who complain of unilateral head pain or unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Appropriate imaging must be performed </plain></SENT>
