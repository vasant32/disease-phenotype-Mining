<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A classification of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVFs) according to their pathogenesis has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that the different angiomorphologies of DAVFs depend on the location of the venous recipient, and that a territorial classification of spontaneous DAVFs can be created based on their acquired development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical and radiographic findings of 96 patients with DAVFs were reviewed, especially with regard to their venous characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DAVFs were subdivided into 5 groups: Type 1--DAVFs of the dural sinuses (n = 39); Type 2--DAVFs of the cavernous sinus (n = 29); Type 3--DAVFs of Galen's system (n = 10); Type 4--DAVFs of the venous plexus at the base of the skull (n = 9); Type 5--DAVFs of the parasinusal cortical veins (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The documentation of a causal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> depends on the location of the DAVF: in 72% of the cases with type 1 DAVFs there was a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at the time of the investigation, but no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could be proved in cases with type 4 DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The morphological development of DAVFs seems to depend on the flow volume of the venous recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A pronounced development of pathological AV shunts takes place at the level of the large basal dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed development</z:hpo> of pathological AV shunts with a low shunt volume occurs in a venous recipient with a low AV pressure gradient </plain></SENT>
