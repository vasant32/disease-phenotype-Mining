<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported a 46-year-old woman in whom cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> manifested itself in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> while she was on an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurological examinations revealed monoparesis of the right upper extremity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> right deep tendon reflex and disturbance of the joint sense, stereognostic sense, two-point discrimination and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin writing</z:e> sense in the right upper extremity, in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278135" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tactile extinction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain CT showed empty triangle sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed infarction near the left postcentral gyrus and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of right sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the MRA study, there was low signal intensity in the posterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus and right transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short latency SEP in upper extremity showed that the central conduction time was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while the amplitude of wave components after N20 was reduced on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both palms were given bilateral or unilateral pressure stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When event-related potentials (ERP) were evoked, using bilateral stimuli as a rare target, and left unilateral stimuli as a non-target, the P 300 latency was prolonged to 450 msec but was restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with the improvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278135" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tactile extinction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results seem to suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278135" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tactile extinction</z:e> is ascribable to a disturbance of recognition at the higher brain function level and that ERP can be a useful objective yardstick in the evaluation of extinction phenomenon </plain></SENT>
