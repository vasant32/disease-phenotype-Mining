<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of PCVT in India is 10 to 12 times more compared to western population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As yet, the etiology of this condition is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the prevalence and the role of the common genetic polymorphisms associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> such as factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T, in aseptic PCVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated 86 women with PCVT and 86 age-matched women with no post-partum complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to identify their genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the three polymorphisms in cases and controls were: factor V Leiden, 2.3% versus 1.2% (OR 0.49, 95% CI=0.02-7.12, p=1.000) and MTHFR C677T, 16.3% versus 17.4% (OR 0.92, 95% CI=0.39-2.19, p=0.838) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prothrombin G20210A variant was not detected in either patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics of the PCVT patients with the polymorphisms did not differ significantly from those without them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our series of PCVT patients, the risk associated with the established thrombophilic risk factors is insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exploration of these gene polymorphisms seems to be of limited value in the investigation of PCVT in south Indian women </plain></SENT>
