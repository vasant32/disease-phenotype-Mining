<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To carry out a retrospective analysis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and the role of cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> in patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients were identified with the clinical and imaging diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The imaging diagnosis was by magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) and/or computed tomography (CT) venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a female predominance with a female to male ratio of 1.5 to 1 (16 women, 9 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age range was from 19 to 64 years old with an average age of 37 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first 10 patients, who ranged in age from 21 to 64 years old (average 37 years), received only anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for periods ranging from 5 days to 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 15 patients ranged in age from 19 to 57 years old (average 38 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They either underwent subsequent thrombectomy after a trial of anticoagulation therapy, or went straight to thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These latter 15 patients had initial evidence of cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, either clinically by severe or worsening symptoms despite anticoagulation therapy, or on initial or subsequent CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our experience, the cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> imaging findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, a <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The thrombolytic treatment technique consisted of the advancement of a 6 Fr guiding catheter to the jugular bulb or sigmoid sinus from a transfemoral approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A microcatheter was then advanced to the proximal portion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and then either tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or urokinase was injected to prevent clot propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A balloon catheter was used to perform thrombectomy since the thrombolytic agents can be injected via the inner lumen with an inflated balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The inflated balloon helped to keep the venous flow from washing out the thrombolytic agent, thus facilitating the agent's effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first 10 patients received only anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for periods ranging from 5 days to 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eight of these were diagnosed with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> only, and had a stable hospital course without worsening of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These patients also did not have imaging evidence of cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The remaining 2 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> on the CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>One had only a small amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the right cerebellum, but the other had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the bilateral basal ganglia and thalamic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients had a stable hospitalization course and experienced a symptom-free recovery, but 1 died with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Seven of the remaining 15 patients were initially treated with anticoagulation therapy for periods ranging from 2 days to 2 months (average 11 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These 7 patients were considered to have failed anticoagulation therapy since they had worsening symptoms, and 5 of these had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on subsequent CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Five of the 7 then underwent thrombectomy with the administration of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 2, 1 underwent thrombectomy alone without the administration of tPA, and the other was given 1 million units of urokinase instead of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients had a symptom-free recovery, but 2 had residual left-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, 1 patient had a minimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo>, and another patient developed a transverse sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> 7 months after thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The remaining 8 patients did not receive anticoagulation therapy, and went straight to treatment with thrombectomy and administration of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these presented with worsening clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Six had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on their imaging studies, 1 had new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on a subsequent CT scan, and 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> along with the dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but experienced worsening clinical symptoms consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Five of these 8 patients experienced a symptom-free recovery, and 3 patients had mild residual <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, an indication for thrombectomy or thrombolytic therapy may be the development of cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> which appears to include (1) worsening or severe clinical symptoms, and/or (2) CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, a <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It appears that anticoagulation therapy alone is not adequate in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when they develop cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This may be due to a lack of sufficient collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Those patients who went straight to thrombectomy because of worsening symptoms, or the imaging findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0010023'>cerebral vascular congestion</z:mp>, survived with either a symptom-free recovery or only mild residual neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The patient with evidence of cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> died while on anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> in patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, even while on anticoagulation therapy, appears to be an indication for thrombectomy and infusion of thrombolytic agent through a balloon catheter to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that this approach appears to improve the chance of survival, with either a symptom-free recovery or a recovery with only mild residual neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
