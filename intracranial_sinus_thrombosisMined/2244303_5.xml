<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the pathophysiological changes in brain tissue that characterize damage following cerebral venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, a model of cerebral venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the rat was devised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This experimental model has the advantage of simultaneously measuring the regional changes in cerebral blood flow as well as the metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ischemic area demonstrated by the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> is confined to the cerebral cortex and becomes enlarged in proportion to the increase in venous pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This metabolic disturbance appears even in the very early period following cerebral venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These pathophysiological features are different from those observed in the case of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
