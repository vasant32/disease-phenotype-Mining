<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to test the sensitivity and specificity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> results, these were compared in 8 cases with the findings of digital subtraction angiography or conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 24 patients arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was performed; in 17 these showed anomalies or abnormalities of the intracranial vascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was performed and demonstrated the presence of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 6 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and DSA showed agreement in 7 cases; in one patient the degree of a stenosis was exaggerated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that arterial and venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is of great value as an additional study in paediatric neurovascular problems </plain></SENT>
