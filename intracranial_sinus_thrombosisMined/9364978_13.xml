<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been clearly demonstrated that the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> functions of the protein C system are important in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first mutation in the thrombomodulin gene was discovered in an American patient suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> at the age of 45 (Ohlin and Marlar 1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report a case of sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a 42-year-old Swedish woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was found to carry a heterozygous point mutation changing G127 to A, predicting an Ala25 to a Thr change in the mature thrombomodulin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mutation was also found in her 16-year-old daughter, who so far has not suffered from any thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient had no other detectable prothrombotic genetic defects associated with the coagulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case supports the hypothesis of an association between mutations in the thrombomodulin gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
