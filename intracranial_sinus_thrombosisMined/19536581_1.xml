<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deep cerebral venous system <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (DCVST) is a rare variety of cerebral vein and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST), therefore clinical information regarding presentation, course and outcome are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this two-center study including 32 patients, we tried to better define symptoms, neuroradiological findings, course, and outcome in DCVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients with DCVST admitted to our two institutions over a period of more than 10 years were identified from prospective registries on CVST and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from the registries were confirmed and complemented by retrospective analysis of patients' charts and neuroradiological imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients with an unequivocal diagnosis of DCVST confirmed by MRI and MRA were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on long-term functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS; ability to return to work) was obtained by telephone interviews performed between 2006 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation was highly variable with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (81%) and reduced consciousness (72%) as the most frequent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nine patients (28%) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was confined to the deep venous system (isolated DCVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patients other sinuses and/or cortical veins were additionally affected (non-isolated DCVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made within one to 76 days (mean = 10.0 +/- 14.1 days) but was significantly delayed in patients with isolated compared to non-isolated DCVST (19.1 +/- 23.0 vs. 6.3 +/- 6.5 days, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was the most frequent parenchymal MRI finding present in 69% of patients, bilateral in 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>D: -dimer levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 13% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients (75%) stabilized and later improved on intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or subcutaneous low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eight (25%) patients deteriorated with progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>; six of them received local endovascular therapy but two died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (range 3 months-13 years), 26 patients (81%) were functionally independent (mRS &lt;/= 2) including 24 patients (75%) with a mRS &lt;/= 1 of whom 23 (96%) returned to their previous job, activity or education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No patients were severely disabled (mRS 4-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Extension of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> beyond the deep venous system had no effect on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Due to its variable clinical presentation the diagnosis of DCVST is often difficult and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment therefore established with substantial delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>While most patients stabilize and have a good recovery, progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> associated with poor outcome is seen in a subset of patients who may thus require other treatment options, such as endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
