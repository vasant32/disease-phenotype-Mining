<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only 15 cases of spontaneous closure of DAVFs have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of spontaneous closure of a DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 60-year-old male presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective cerebral angiography revealed a left posterior DAVF fed by the left occipital artery and the middle meningeal artery, which drained into the left transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following the initial angiography, the patient exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> with transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These symptoms, along with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, disappeared by the following day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the initial angiography, a second angiography was performed that revealed the complete disappearance of the DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have described a long period of closure for DAVFs following initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms for spontaneous closure of DAVFs include the development of scar tissue or a sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that leads to occlusion of the DAVF In this case, the DAVF closure may have been due to a sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induced by sinus stenosis, since occlusion of the draining sinuses coincided with the spontaneous closure of the DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases of non-traumatic DAVF without cortical venous reflex that do not present severe symptoms, a prudent course of treatment is necessary since there is a chance of spontaneous closure of the DAVF occuring </plain></SENT>
