<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an earlier comparison1 between women with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) and the female population of the Netherlands, we found that oral contraceptives increased the risk for CVST (age-adjusted odds ratio: 13; 95 percent confidence interval 5&amp;#x2013;37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now report additional data on the risk of third-generation oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This expression is generally taken to mean combined pills containing either gestodene or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi>.We enrolled women aged 18&amp;#x2013;54 with newly diagnosed CVST in a clinical trial between 1992 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 40 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on use of oral contraceptives at the time of the initial symptoms of CVST was obtained from the patient or nearest relative, supplemented by medical sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control data were obtained from prescription information about <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women aged 15&amp;#x2013;64 years in a population of 3&amp;#xb7;2 million insured persons in 1994 in the Netherlands.2 We calculated odds ratios as approximations of relative risks, based on the percentage distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because observed odds were compared with population frequencies, we did not calculate confidence intervals, as the size of the control group would make them invariably statistically significant.Of the 40 women, 34 (85%) had been using oral contraceptives at the time of CVST, and 19 of them were on third-generation products (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control population 38% of those who were on the pill used third-generation contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This yields an odds ratio for third-generation contraceptives of two to one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the age categories 15&amp;#x2013;24, 25&amp;#x2013;44, and 45&amp;#x2013;64, the use of third-generation products in the controls was 46%, 34%, and 31%; in the patients it was 60% (6 of 10), 47% (9 of 19), and 80% (4 of 5).Our data on family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If we assume that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a genetic prothombotic abnormality had a positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and re-analyse the data without these patients, this does not change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven CVST patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormality</z:hpo>: two of them had used third-generation products, four had taken other oral contraceptives, and one had used none </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age categories: for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, use of third-generation contraceptives was higher among the patients than among controls.We conclude that the increased risk for venous thrombo-embolism in users of third-generation products, compared with other oral contraceptives, recently confirmed by a WHO expert committee,3 is also found for CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since CVST is rare (estimated annual incidence four per million) there is no need for individual women to change their contraceptive, unless additional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (such as hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorders</z:e> or a strong family history) are present </plain></SENT>
