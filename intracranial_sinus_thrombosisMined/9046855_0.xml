<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> since age of two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission temperature was 37.9 degrees C but, nuchal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> and Kernig's sign were not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no other abnormal findings on physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed consciousness disturbance, generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> gradually developed after generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data did not show any abnormalites to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A brain MRI revealed hyperintensity on T2-weighted images and slightly enhanced on T1-weighted images in the left frontal lobe, using Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increased signal was also noted in the superior sagittal sinus on T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The superior sagittal sinus was patent but the cortical vein in the left frontal lobe was not demonstrated on cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of an isolated cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was made by exploratory craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> usually co-exsists with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, an isolated cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> like this case was rather rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> localized only in the left frontal cortical vein is reported, but definitive etiology is not known </plain></SENT>
