<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> has been reported among patients with spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, but a causal relationship has not been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience with spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and we reviewed the relevant literature to evaluate the relationship between these 2 entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and imaging studies of a consecutive group of patients with spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> evaluated at a tertiary care center between 1/1/2001 and 12/31/2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main search strategy was a systemic review of journal articles in MEDLINE (1966 to January 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 141 patients with spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, 3 (2.1%) were also diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these 3 patients and the 17 reported in the literature there were 11 men and 9 women with a mean age of 39.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiographic or clinical evidence for spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was found in most patients, while there was no evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> preceding spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight (40%) of the 20 patients were found to have a change in their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> pattern believed to be due to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, eg, cerebral venous infarction, occurred in 8 patients (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is found in only about 2% of patients with spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> pattern is not a reliable predictor of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
