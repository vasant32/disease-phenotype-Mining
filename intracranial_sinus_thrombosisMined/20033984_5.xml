<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate this gender disparity, total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration was measured in children with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS; n = 72), children with cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CSVT; n = 52), and 109 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> levels above the 90th percentile for age and gender were documented in 10 children with AIS (13.9%) and 10 with CSVT (19.2%), totaling 16.7% of patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> overall, as compared with only 2 of 109 controls (1.8%; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis with adjustment for total cholesterol level, hematocrit, and pubertal status, elevated <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was independently associated with increased disease risk (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: overall = 3.98 [1.38-11.45]; AIS = 3.88 [1.13-13.35]; CSVT = 5.50 [1.65-18.32]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further adjusted analyses revealed that, for each 1nmol/l increase in <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> in boys, the odds of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were increased 1.3-fold </plain></SENT>
