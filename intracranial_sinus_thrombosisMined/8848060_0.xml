<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University Hospital Groningen, the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The medical histories of 11 patients with neuro-otological complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time interval between the first manifestation of symptoms related to the complication and the start of correct therapy was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10 of the 11 patients persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and (or) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> were manifest as early symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More severe morbidity was correlated with an increased time interval between the early symptoms and the start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doctor's delay was regarded as the most significant delaying factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of neuro-otological complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> based on the early symptoms persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> can reduce morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
