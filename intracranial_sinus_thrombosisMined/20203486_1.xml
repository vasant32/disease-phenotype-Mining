<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of nonhemorrhagic lesions is poorly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> cohort, demographic, clinical, risk factor, prognosis and imaging findings were compared between patients with parenchymal nonhemorrhagic lesions and no hemorrhagic lesions (NHL) and (1) patients with parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) and (2) patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictors of prognosis at the end of follow-up in the NHL group were analyzed by bivariate and Cox regression methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 147 patients (23.6%) with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared to patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> (n = 309), those with NHL more often presented mental status disturbances, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, decreased alertness, motor deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, occlusions of the straight sinus, deep venous system and cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with NHL had a better prognosis in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and at the end of follow-up than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, but a worse one than patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, as more NHL patients were dead or dependent (modified Rankin Scale score = 3-6) at discharge (19.7 vs. 6.5%, p &lt; 0.001) and final follow-up (14.3 vs. 7.4%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (HR = 13.7; 95% CI = 4.3-43.7) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep venous system (HR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4-8.7) were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> patients with NHL are intermediate between patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, both in initial clinical picture and prognosis </plain></SENT>
