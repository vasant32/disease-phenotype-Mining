<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a rare entity that can be difficult to manage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intrasinus thrombolysis is an increasingly applied intervention, but this modality carries an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe for the first time an option with a potentially lower incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp>, the combination of the AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy catheter with intra-arterial thrombolysis, in 2 patients with extensive dural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinus thromboses</z:e>, preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and severe progressive neurological deficits despite <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four procedures were performed in 2 patients with thromboses in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses (right in 1 patient and bilateral in 1 patient) and cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rheolytic thrombectomy was performed in the sigmoid, transverse, straight, and superior sagittal sinuses; this technique involves the use of the Bernoulli effect to create a vacuum that fragments and aspirates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For associated persistent cortical vein thromboses, low-dose intra-arterial thrombolysis was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients had excellent angiographic results with sinus reopening after rheolytic thrombectomy and cortical vein reopening after intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT showed no change in 1 patient and increased preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had a negative hypercoagulable workup, and the other patient had probable anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, both patients had excellent clinical outcome with no neurological deficits except mild short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of rheolytic thrombectomy with intra-arterial thrombolysis is a treatment modality that allows accelerated recanalization of occluded dural sinuses and cerebral veins with lower doses of thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
