<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the charts of 82 patients who had been admitted to the University of Mississippi Medical Center between Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1, 1985, and Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>31, 1999, for treatment of complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 82 patients, 43 had orbital complications and 39 had intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, we describe our findings in those patients who had intracranial complications (our findings in patients with orbital complications will be reported in a future article) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common intracranial complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>; others were epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, subdural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, intracerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472513" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pott's puffy tumor</z:e>, and superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> were treated with drug therapy only; patients with abscesses were generally treated with intravenous antibiotics and drainage of the affected sinus and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Advancements in antibiotic therapy, endoscopic surgery, imaging studies, and computer-assisted surgery have helped improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Management of these patients should be undertaken immediately and is best achieved via a multidisciplinary approach, involving the otolaryngologist, neurosurgeon, radiologist, anesthesiologist, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> disease specialist, pediatrician, internist, and others </plain></SENT>
