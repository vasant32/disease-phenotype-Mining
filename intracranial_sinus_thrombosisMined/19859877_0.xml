<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a rare condition that is generally associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> processes, one of the most important being <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associated prothrombotic disorders can be detected in approximately half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, regardless of the aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients usually present clinical symptoms like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> and diminished level of awareness, this latter factor being linked to a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: We report the cases of two paediatric patients with a clinical picture of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> within a context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> as a complication of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear infection</z:e>, in whom cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients were treated with lumbar punctures to evacuate cerebrospinal fluid and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was added in the case of the second patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, because of the persistence of the symptoms of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt had to be performed in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The preferred diagnostic method is magnetic resonance imaging with venography, although in an emergency computerised tomography can help reach a diagnosis in a third of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to treating the symptoms, anticoagulation is also accepted (degree of evidence 1B) to prevent further progression </plain></SENT>
