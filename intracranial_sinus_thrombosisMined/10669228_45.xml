<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography is often used to examine the intracranial venous system, particularly in the evaluation of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in the depiction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and its variants, to assess its potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and to compare the findings with those of conventional catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms obtained in 100 persons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies were reviewed to determine the presence or absence of the dural sinuses and major intracranial veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Systematic review of the 100 cases revealed transverse sinus flow gaps in 31% of the cases, with 90% of these occurring in the nondominant transverse sinus and 10% in the codominant transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No flow gaps occurred in the dominant transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The superior sagittal and straight sinuses were seen in every venogram; the occipital sinus was seen in only 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vein of Galen and internal cerebral veins were also seen in every case; the basal veins of Rosenthal were present in 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transverse sinus flow gaps can be observed in as many as 31% of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings; these gaps should not be mistaken for dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
