<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Trufill n-BCA) versus <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi> vinyl alcohol <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> (ONYX) for the embolization of cranial dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients with cranial dural AVF were treated with liquid embolic agents from November, 2003 to November, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These 53 patients had 56 lesions treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial embolization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients embolized to completion underwent follow-up angiography at 3 months to assess for durable occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one lesions were treated with n-BCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients treated with n-BCA had initial angiographic occlusion of their DAVF, which were durable at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients had adjunctive treatment with coils and/or polyvinyl alcohol particles, but none of these were occluded by endovascular treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients underwent post-embolization surgery for closure of their DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five lesions were treated with ONYX in 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients treated with ONYX had initial angiographic occlusion of their DAVF by embolization alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had recurrence at 3 months and was re-treated out of 27 total follow-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent post-embolization surgical obliteration of their lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initial angiographic occlusion (p=0.0004) and durable angiographic occlusion (p=0.0018) rates for embolization of cranial DAVF show a statistically significant higher efficacy with ONYX compared with n-BCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients embolized with ONYX underwent surgery less frequently compared with those treated with n-BCA (p=0.0015) </plain></SENT>
