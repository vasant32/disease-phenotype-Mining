<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This report details experience with local intraarterial or intradural sinus thrombolytic therapy for cerebrovascular thromboembolic occlusions in 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1991 and April 1995, intracranial local thrombolytic therapy with urokinase was used to treat 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery, middle cerebral artery, basilar artery, or combined internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had embolic complications related to cerebral vascular embolization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients were undergoing intracranial angioplasty procedures for occlusive atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local intraarterial thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboembolic <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> resulted in excellent restoration of perfusion in 18 patients, partial restoration of flow in four patients, and no effect in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of these patients had excellent clinical outcomes, seven made moderate improvements, and six died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the two patients with central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>, no angiographic or clinical response to thrombolytic therapy could be ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no angiographic improvement response from thrombolytic therapy in five patients with primary intracranial atheromatous stenosis, and one patient may have had an embolic complication related to this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of six patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had clearing of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and an excellent clinical result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining three with extensive dural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> did not have clearing of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>; one patient became blind, and two patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the 40 patients treated, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred after therapy in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Local thrombolytic therapy for thromboembolic occlusive cerebrovascular disease is useful in restoring perfusion of acutely occluded vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further experience is needed to fully identify the most appropriate patients for therapy, dose of thrombolytic agent, timing and length of therapy, and risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
