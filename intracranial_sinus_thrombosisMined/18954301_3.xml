<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the nature and incidence of neurologic complications in patients undergoing a renal transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2007, 132 adults (35 women, 97 men; mean age, 34.32 -/+ 0.90 years) underwent a renal transplant at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associated comorbid medical conditions, presenting neurologic symptoms, and type of immunosuppression were obtained from patients' medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major indications for renal transplant were hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (14.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000076'>vesicoureteral reflux</z:hpo> (11.4%), and idiopathic causes (21.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 17.26 -/+ 0.89 months (range, 2 weeks to 40 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty neurologic complications were found in 18 patients (6 women, 12 men; mean age, 33.83 -/+ 2.37 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome, 1 (5.6%); cephalgia, 10 (55.6%); cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, 2 (11.1%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, 3 (16.7%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, 2 (11.1%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, 1 (5.6%); and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 1 (5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">Immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> were the primary cause of 16 of the 20 neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness and complications of cyclosporinewere screened for a total of 1858.50 months, tacrolimus for 853.50 months, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> for 620 months; 50.2% of the neurologic complications appeared during the first 3 months after transplant; the blood level of immunosuppressive medications did not need to be higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and tacrolimus, we suggest (for the first time) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> as a cause of neurocomplications after renal transplant </plain></SENT>
