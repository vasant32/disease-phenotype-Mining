<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For patients with limited venous access secondary to sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or for patients where parent sinus occlusion would not be tolerated, transvenous embolization may not be possible and other treatment methods must be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 69-year-old female patient with a two-year history of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002317'>unsteady gait</z:hpo> underwent cerebral angiography that revealed three separate DAVFs with congested cortical venous drainage overlying both frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an application of a transarterial wedged-catheter, flow-arrest technique, N-butyl cyanoacrylate was deposited across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three pathologic arteriovenous connections providing a definitive cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transarterial NBCA embolization may provide curative treatment of DAVFs, and is of particular utility in situations where access to the draining venous structures is limited </plain></SENT>
