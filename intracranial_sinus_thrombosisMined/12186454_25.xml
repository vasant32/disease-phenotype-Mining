<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Transvenous embolization is effective in the treatment of an intracranial dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (DAVF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Access to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> via the internal jugular vein (IJV) may be limited by associated dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; a transcranial approach has been developed for venous embolization in such a situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report their experiences with the use of a transcranial approach for venous embolization of DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with DAVFs underwent craniectomy and embolization procedures in which direct sinus puncture was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DAVFs were located inside the dura mater that constituted the walls of the transverse sinus in five cases, the superior sagittal sinus in four cases, and the superior petrosal sinus in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DAVFs drained directly into a sinus with secondary reflux into leptomeningeal veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> could not be accessed from the IJVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Craniectomy was performed in an operating room and, in seven cases, subsequent enlargement of the craniectomy was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sinus catheterization was performed after the patient had been transferred to the angiography room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DAVFs were embolized using coils only in five patients, glue only in two patients, and both coils and glue in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographic confirmation that embolization of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was successful was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A transient complication occurred during the first case after sinus catheterization was attempted in the operating room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The transcranial approach allows straightforward access to DAVFs located on superficial dural sinuses that are inaccessible from the IJVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of this approach is similar to that of the standard retrograde venous approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The correct location and adequate extent of the craniectomy are essential for success to be achieved using this technique </plain></SENT>
