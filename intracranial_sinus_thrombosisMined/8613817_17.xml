<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> in two patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>neurinoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003001'>glomus jugulare tumor</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_381'>ameloblastoma</z:mpath> in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The involved sigmoid sinus was resected along with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and ligated at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> edge; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> that remained of the sigmoid sinus was a small stump on the retrosigmoid portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial angiography performed before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> surgery revealed no abnormal arteriovenous communications or dural AVF in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although many reports have suggested that sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of dural AVFs, this has been difficult to verify because of the small number of cases in which serial angiography was performed before the development of a dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases presented in this article, surgical resection of a dural AVF and histological examination were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subintimal fibrous thickening was marked, and the sinus wall was found to contain many dural vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Organized <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with neovascularization was seen in only two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases demonstrate that subintimal fibrous thickening a hypertrophied sinus wall secondary to increased intrasinus pressure or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurring after sinus occlusion can provoke the development of a dural AVF within the course of a lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of intrasinus blood flow may be very important to prevent this late postoperative complication </plain></SENT>
