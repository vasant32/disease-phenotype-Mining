<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of middle ear floor reconstruction in management of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> due to high jugular bulb with dehiscent middle ear floor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of seven patients with high dehiscent jugular bulb, presenting with incapacitating pulsatile roaring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> that was abolished by digital compression of the ipsilateral jugular vein, from January 2002 to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by CT scan of the temporal bone (bone window, coronal views) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The seven patients were surgically explored, five under local anesthesia (to monitor the results with possible intraoperative revision) and two under general endotracheal anesthesia, for middle ear floor reconstruction that was done using bone dust, perichondrium, and tragal cartilage (mean follow-up 28 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the seven patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> disappeared in four (57%) and decreased in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall improvement was five of seven (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The preliminary results suggest that surgical reconstruction of the middle ear floor under local anesthesia offers valuable treatment for patients with incapacitating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> due to dehiscent middle ear floor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first trial of multilayer reconstruction of the middle ear floor dehiscence to manage high jugular bulb causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
