<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A case of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> following a mild closed head injury due to an uncommon cause is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 7-year-old child presented with GCS 15 after a road traffic accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT revealed an occipital fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten days later the child developed signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venogram at this time revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the transverse sinus with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the contralateral transverse and sigmoid sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's anitiphospholipid antibody titres were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The role of inherited and acquired procoagulant factors in the aetiology of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is increasingly being recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When a patient presents with sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after a closed mild head injury, it is necessary to investigate for the presence of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> as it has implications for the long-term management of the patient </plain></SENT>
