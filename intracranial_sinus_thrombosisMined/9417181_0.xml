<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Orbital or endocranial complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> are rare clinical syndromes in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively examined the complications that occurred and the role of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the complications were caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the ethmoid or sphenoid cells with direct extension through dehiscent areas (flat bone) or neurovascular foramina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRT had the highest sensitivity in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early elimination of the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by FESS prevents spread of the complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Advantages of FESS included better orientation and surgical access to the paranasal system of infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The orbital complications were treated by surgical exploration of the communication pathways by a new endoscopic speculum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory foci by FESS prevents spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in complications of paranasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> in infancy </plain></SENT>
