<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To produce cerebral venograms with thin-section helical computed tomography (CT) and to assess their diagnostic utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six CT venograms were obtained in 33 patients after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had suspected dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> adjacent to a major venous structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent CT venography during CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Superior sagittal, transverse, and straight sinuses were identified on every CT venogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other veins were seen with high frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was diagnosed in seven patients, with magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) venographic correlation in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT venograms were easier to interpret and had fewer artifacts than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relationships of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to adjacent cerebral venous structures were well shown on CT venograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT venography yields detailed images of the intracranial venous circulation with consistently high quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is a rapid, useful method for diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and for preoperative mapping of venous structures in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
