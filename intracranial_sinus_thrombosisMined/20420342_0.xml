<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The displacements recorded in TCCS are evoked either by the acoustic stapedius reflex or spontaneous movements generated by intracranial cardiovascular or by respiratory pressure waves transmitted through the inner ear to the stapes and thence to the tympanic membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the amplitude and direction of these displacements has enabled neurosurgeons and neurologists to estimate cerebrospinal fluid pressures in patients evaluated by TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procedure allows for applications in neurootology, particularly in those patients who present with symptoms of pulsating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, dizziness and imbalance, or hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study describes the application of TCCS tests in a series of patients whose diagnoses included perilymphatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and a variety of neurological conditions such as idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and cerebrovascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> and abnormal intracranial pressure waves are associated with common neurootological symptoms, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, dizziness, and hearing dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TCCS is a valuable addition to neurootologists' test batteries </plain></SENT>
