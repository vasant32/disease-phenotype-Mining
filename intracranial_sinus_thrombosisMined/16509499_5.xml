<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical and angiography results in 10 patients with transverse-sigmoid dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVFs) treated using sinus angioplasty and dural sinus stent insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2001 and 2003, 10 consecutive patients (six men and four women, age range 54-79 years) who had presented with transverse and/or sigmoid sinus DAVFs with or without sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> underwent self-expanding stent placement and balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> involved the transverse sinus, three the sigmoid sinus, and one the torcular and occipital sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the Djindjian-Merland grading system, there were two Type I, five Type Ila, one Type Ilb, and two Type IV DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean clinical follow-up period was 21.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the last follow-up examination, seven patients were asymptomatic and three were dramatically improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean angiography follow-up period was 7.5 months for the available population: four patients had complete DAVF occlusion, four had significant flow reduction, and two who experienced clinical improvement refused conventional angiography control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed computerized tomography angiography scans were obtained to evaluate stent permeability in nine of the 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stent permeability was demonstrated in eight of the nine patients with available control studies at a mean follow up of 20.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two transient neurological deficits but no severe and permanent complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series, sinus stent insertion resulted in a cure or significant clinical improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients harboring a DAVF, with no severe or permanent complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stent placement for transverse and/or sigmoid sinus DAVFs is a promising technique whose viability should be confirmed in larger series with longer follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
