<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many children do well, as there is significant mortality as well as morbidity for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in addition to a high risk for recurrence, making a diagnosis in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venography and arteriography (including the neck vessels if the intracranial vessels are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) are usually indicated despite the problems i.e. contrast CT requires a high dose of radiation while emergency <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> usually requires anaesthesia and conventional arteriography carries a small risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is unusual for children with anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to be triaged quickly enough (&lt;4.5 h) for thrombolysis but this may occasionally be appropriate in posterior circulation occlusion associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, where the time window is longer (&lt;12 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation carries relatively low risk and may be of benefit for children with venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (acutely and when at risk subsequently) or extracranial dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspirin to attempt to reduce the recurrence risk is appropriate in the medium term for the majority of patients with arterial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
