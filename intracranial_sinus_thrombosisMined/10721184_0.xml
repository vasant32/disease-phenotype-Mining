<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral sinus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in puerperium can be hidden behind unspecific symptoms like strong <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Literature reorts varying mortality between 5 and 30% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Blood coagulation disorders</z:e> such as lack of Antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S, have been identified as a particularly important origin of the cerebral sinus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is subject to discussion whether the patient should be advised against any further pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From a medical point of view, a subsequent pregnancy seems acceptable because the risk of another <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which is a rare event anyway, can be significantly reduced by providing anticoagulation substances </plain></SENT>
