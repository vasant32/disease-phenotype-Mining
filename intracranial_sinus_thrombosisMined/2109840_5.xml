<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several thrombolytic agents, such as urokinase and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, are recommended for treatment, major significant risks include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, especially in patients with venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has shown a high affinity for fibrin-bound plasminogen, while exhibiting a low affinity for circulating plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate this drug for use in cerebral sinus thrombo-occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven adult male rabbits were chosen as experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals underwent microsurgical dissection of their major dural venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct compression was used to form a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> within the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was confirmed radiographically by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31709">iohexol</z:chebi> sinography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, tPA was delivered systemically via the marginal ear vein at a dose of 3000 units/h; the result was total lysis of the clot documented by a sinogram 1 hour after the drug was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postmortem pathological examination confirmed total lysis in seven of eight animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One animal showed partial retained clot fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant coagulopathic state was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In three control animals, saline was infused without clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that tPA is a highly effective agent for the lysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> induced venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in an experimental model </plain></SENT>
