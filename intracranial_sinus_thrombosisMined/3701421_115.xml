<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors describe their experience with four cases of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) which led them to analyze the clinical aspects of these lesions in an attempt to understand their pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An additional 191 previously reported cases of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s were reviewed with special attention to the mechanism of intradural, central, and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apart from the peripheral cranial nerve symptoms, which are most likely due to arterial steal, the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) symptoms appear to be related to passive venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generalized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> symptoms can be related to cerebrospinal fluid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> due either to increased pressure in the superior sagittal sinus, to venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or to meningeal reaction resulting from minimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These phenomena are not related to the anatomical type of venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, focal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> symptoms are specifically indicative of cortical venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and brain-stem and cerebellar symptoms can be encountered depending on the territory of the draining vein or veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the localizing value of focal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> symptomatology relates to the venous territory and not to the nidus or to the arterial supply characteristics of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the venous patterns of various dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s at the base of the skull are expressed by differences in their clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa and of the tentorium are almost always drained by the cortical veins and, therefore, have a high risk of intradural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remarkable similarities in the manifestations of dural and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s and the differences in the manifestations of dural and spinal dural AMV's are pointed out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High-quality angiograms and a multidisciplinary approach to the study of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s will provide the best understanding of their symptoms and, therefore, the most appropriate treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
