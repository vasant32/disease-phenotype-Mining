<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review the clinical manifestations, radiologic findings, and treatment modalities of our cases with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (LST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Documents of patients with LST, diagnosed and treated from 1995 to 2001 in our clinic, were examined retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients with the diagnosis of LST were treated during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the clinical manifestations of these patients, the most frequently encountered symptoms were earache and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, in addition to otorrhea and hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo>, three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> and one with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delta sign was detected in three cases on computed tomography, whereas a suspicious image was noted in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case underwent magnetic resonance angiography, and the diagnosis of LST was established conclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two cases, because pus was aspirated via lateral sinus punctures performed intraoperatively, these sinuses were explored and obliterated following radical mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because pus was not aspirated via punctures of the other two cases, their sinuses were not explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only radical mastoidectomy was performed surgically for these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dual antibiotics and low-dose <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy were given concomitantly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recanalizations of the nonobliterated lateral sinuses were detected with Doppler ultrasonography of internal jugular vena at 15 days and 3 months after the termination of postoperative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical findings and radiologic techniques play an important role in the diagnosis of LST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the treatment, if pus is found in the lateral sinuses, it is necessary to explore, clean, and obliterate them, whereas in cases in which the aspirates do not contain pus, mastoidectomy is sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a low dose of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> can be used together with antibiotics in the nonobliterated lateral sinuses </plain></SENT>
