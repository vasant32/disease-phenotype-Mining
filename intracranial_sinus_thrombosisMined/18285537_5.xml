<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize differences in the prevalence of thrombophilic variables in a large cohort of patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) and lower extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An inception cohort of individuals was identified with first lifetime incident CVST between 1995 and 2005 for whom comprehensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> prevalence differs with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> location, test results were compared to a randomly selected group of patients with lower extremity DVT with comprehensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During this time period, 163 patients with CVST were identified who underwent comprehensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> results were abnormal in 29% including anticardiolipin antibodies (17%), heterozygous factor V Leiden (10%), and heterozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation (n = 14/122; 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prothrombin mutation was more than twice as common in patients with CVST (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance, factor V Leiden, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> were more common in patients with DVT (p &lt; 0.05 for each comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anticardiolipin antibodies in patients with CVST were primarily low titer IgM isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> factors differs comparing patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These differences may offer insights into mechanisms governing the geographic distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
