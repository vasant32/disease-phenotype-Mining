<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neonates with confirmed radiographic evidence of cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of these neonates showed clot extension or other complications on follow-up imaging that were obtained within 72 hours with either magnetic resonance imaging or computed topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five neonates were treated with anticoagulation, and none of these patients developed new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
