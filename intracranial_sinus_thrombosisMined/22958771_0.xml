<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment including anticoagulation raises concerns about the associated high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of multifocal CVST with mechanical thrombectomy devices and local tPA infusion have previously been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these devices may have technical limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Success of the new-generation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy device like the Penumbra system has been reported in few cases of isolated CVST without the use of chemical thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe two cases in which mechanical thrombectomy were used in conjunction with intra-sinus tPA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both cases were complicated and failed initial anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Penumbra 054 was used in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Penumbra 054 is a novel device that has a bigger lumen which provides compatibility with other microcatheters, if additional therapies are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The larger internal diameter of this catheter also allows for stronger thrombo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, potentially effecting more rapid sinus recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both cases showed remarkable clinical recovery without any major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported simultaneous use of the Penumbra system 054 along with tPA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New devices such as the Penumbra system may offer additional therapeutic options in the treatment of multifocal CVST </plain></SENT>
