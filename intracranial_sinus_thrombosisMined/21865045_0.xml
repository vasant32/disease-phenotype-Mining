<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to describe the effects of high-voltage electricity on the scalp, meninges, brain parenchyma, and venous sinuses of a 10-year-old girl with an accidental high-voltage electrical burn of the head who presented with an area of full-thickness scalp loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance venography demonstrated that the anterior third of the superior sagittal sinus was thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The child underwent surgical debridement of the wound with a duraplasty and transposition scalp-flap reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She recovered well after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our patient had no neurological deficit at presentation, and she had no new deficit at her 6-month follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that despite the electrical nature of the brain, direct neural injury is largely thermal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, a scalp burn deep enough to involve the superior sagittal sinus has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physicians must be aware of the potential for delayed neurological deterioration, including severe deficits such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
