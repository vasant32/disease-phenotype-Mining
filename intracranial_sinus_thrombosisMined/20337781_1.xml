<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consisted of two parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case-control study included neuroradiologically confirmed paediatric ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients from two tertiary children's hospitals in Estonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For control group, DNA was obtained from 400 anonymous screening test cards of newborns born consecutively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> delivery departments of Estonia in January 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses was performed to assess the association between paediatric sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and FVL and PT 20210G&gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 75 children (45 boys, 30 girls) were included into the case-control study: 19 with childhood arterial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 49 with perinatal arterial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both FVL and PT 20210G&gt;A occurred significantly more frequently among patients with sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> compared with controls (OR = 12.9; 95% CI: 2.3-73.0 and OR = 11.9; 95% CI: 2.1-67.2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference was not significant between childhood/perinatal arterial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses (including our study) revealed that both FVL and PT 20210G&gt;A are associated with paediatric sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.8-5.5 and OR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.4-6.8, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FVL and PT 20210G&gt;A are associated with paediatric sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
