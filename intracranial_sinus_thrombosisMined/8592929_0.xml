<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The age ranged from 1 month to 16 years of age (average: 2.5 years) with 8 below 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms for infants were mental change (75%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (100%), mainly generalized (63%) in character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associated illness was mainly closed head injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> infants had mild to severe motor handicap in a 1 to 10 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, older children frequently presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (37%) or consciousness change (50%), and were more frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> or local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four (50%) of them recovered completely, but two died and two were finally in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the four patients with poor prognosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had severe initial insults and widespread sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI and MRA are better than CT for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that prognosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> cases in infants is worse than in older children, but this also depends on the severity of initial insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For infants who present with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> should be taken into account when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are difficult to control </plain></SENT>
