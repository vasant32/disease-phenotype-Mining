<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Since feeding arteries from both the internal and external carotid artery are common, cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> of Barrow type D are difficult to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embolization using the transarterial approach is considered to be the standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is often impossible to embolize feeders from the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transorbital approach after anterior orbitotomy through the ophthalmic vein is an alternative in this complex situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following reports our experience with three female patients who underwent transvenous embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was documented using standardized MRI and clinical reevaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three female patients between 57 and 78 years of age were diagnosed with carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> by conventional angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were suffering from exophthalmus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient we performed a technically successful transarterial embolization using particles, but no relevant improvement of the patient's condition was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transfemoral transvenous access via the sinus petrosus was not possible in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were then embolized via the ophthalmic vein using GDC detachable coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were clinically reevaluated by an ophthalmologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also a standardized MRI was performed for documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was performed for the first patient for 32 months, for the second patient for 34 months and for the third patient for 50 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transvenous embolization was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms disappeared rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Postprocedural MRI showed a symmetric diameter of the ophthalmic vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the orbit caused by fatty tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> regressed completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial vessels without evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Complex carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> of Barrow type D seem to be successfully treatable by embolization using the transvenous approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms seem to regress rapidly after the procedure, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> being the last to regress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>MRI imaging criteria for procedural success include a diameter reduction of the ophthalmic vein, a reduction of the orbital fatty tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and an inconspicuous CE-MRA </plain></SENT>
