<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is extensive experimental evidence to support the investigation of treatment with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birth asphyxia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, clinical studies have been delayed by the difficulty in predicting long-term outcome very soon after birth and by concern about adverse effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine whether it is feasible to select infants with a bad neurological prognosis and to begin hypothermic therapy within 6 hours of birth, and to observe the effect of this therapy on relevant physiologic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen newborn infants with clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birth asphyxia</z:e> (median cord blood pH: 6.74; range: 6.58-7.08) were assessed by amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), and mild whole body <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was instituted within 6 hours of birth in the 10 infants with an aEEG prognostic of a bad outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rectal temperature was maintained at 33.2 +/- (standard deviation).6 degrees C for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rectal and tympanic membrane temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, blood gases, blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, full blood count, blood electrolytes, high and low shear rate viscosity, and coagulation studies were monitored during and after cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A preliminary assessment of neurological outcome was made by repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> infants selected to receive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> developed <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> and a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> infants had prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo> (median pH: 7.30; base excess: -6.3 mmol x L(-1), a high blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (median <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>: 5.3 mmol x L(-1)) and low blood <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels (median value: 3.9 mmol x L(-1)) x <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> was associated with lower heart rate and higher mean blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, these changes did not seem to be clinically relevant and no significant complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood viscosity and coagulation studies were similar during and after cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unusual MRI findings were noted in 3 infants: transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with subsequent small cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; probable <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the straight sinus; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six of the 10 cooled infants had minor abnormalities only or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> follow-up neurological examination; 3 infants died and 1 had major abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the 6 infants with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aEEG developed severe neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> or neurological sequel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birth asphyxia</z:e> infants can be objectively selected by aEEG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> started within 6 hours of birth in infants at high risk of developing severe neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prolonged mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> to 33 degrees C to 34 degrees C is associated with minor physiologic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies of both the safety and efficacy of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, including further neuroimaging studies, are warranted </plain></SENT>
