<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is often difficult to manage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment options include systemically delivered anticoagulation therapy or chemical thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Targeted endovascular delivery of thrombolytic agents is currently a popular option, but it carries an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These strategies require significant time to produce thrombolysis, often in a patient with a rapidly deteriorating neurological condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid mechanical recanalization with thrombectomy is therefore very attractive; this procedure provides rapid recanalization with no increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from use of thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the rheolytic catheter is large and stiff and may not be able to navigate tortuous intracranial vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors present their experience with direct dural sinus mechanical thrombectomy performed using the rheolytic catheter via a transcranial route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and rapidly deteriorating levels of consciousness underwent unsuccessful attempts at mechanical thrombolysis via the usual transfemoral route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Through a burr hole over the dural sinus, mechanical thrombectomy was subsequently performed using the thrombectomy catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sinus patency was restored following treatment and both patients demonstrated neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> or a rapidly deteriorating neurological condition may preclude the use of systemic or locally delivered thrombolytic agents for the treatment of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanical thrombectomy may be the treatment of choice in these circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with limited transfemoral access, a transcranial approach may be used to access the cerebral dural sinuses and thrombectomy may be safely and effectively performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of this therapy is warranted </plain></SENT>
