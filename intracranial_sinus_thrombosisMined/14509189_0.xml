<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Attending physicians requested cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better evaluate the clinical justification of requested imaging procedure the patient medical history and performed CT examination were carefully revised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to this analysis and based on a clinicoradiological methodology, the request of a cerebral angiography was considered appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The examination showed several radiological signs but a definitive diagnosis could not be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second choice imaging procedures were analyzed and MRI completed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It allowed to document transverse and sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the diagnosis of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, MRI combined with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography was shown to be a method of first choice while angiography plays a major role in therapy for intravascular thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
