<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recanalization in dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>) has been observed previously; however, systematic prospective data are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of recanalization on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> outcome has not yet been thoroughly evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> were prospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were graded with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) on hospital admission and discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) on hospital discharge and after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of illness, followed by oral anticoagulation for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imaging follow-up with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and, in a few cases, with CT or conventional angiography was performed on hospital discharge and after 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve-month functional outcome was excellent in 89% of patients with an mRS of 0 or 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A recanalization rate of 60% was already observed on hospital discharge (22+/-6 days); thereafter, recanalization rates increased insignificantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization was not related to NIHSS score on hospital discharge or an mRS of 0 on discharge or after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a high frequency of early recanalization but without influence on clinical outcome parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frequent imaging follow-ups in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> are not useful because they provide no information on patient outcome </plain></SENT>
