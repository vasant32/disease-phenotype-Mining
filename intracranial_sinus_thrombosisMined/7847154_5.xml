<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although uncommon, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report six patients with dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> that presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five cases the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was intraparenchymal (localized to the parietooccipital area in three), while it was confined to the subarachnoid space in the remaining one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dAVM involved the transverse sinus in three cases, was based along the tentorial incisura in two, and was at the level of the torcular Herophili in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leptomeningeal drainage was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the draining vein(s) was identified in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sinus stenosis/occlusion was identified in two of the four patients with a dAVM draining into a major dural sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent pre-operative embolization, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had surgical resection of their lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anatomical cure, as defined by absence of any residual dAVM on postoperative angiogram, was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that several findings such as leptomeningeal drainage, location outside a major venous sinus, variceal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, sinus stenosis/occlusion increase the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and are frequently observed in those dAVMs that present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these angiographic features is critical in planning a therapeutic approach tailored to the characteristics of the individual case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When these angiographic findings are present, prompt and definitive treatment is mandatory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
