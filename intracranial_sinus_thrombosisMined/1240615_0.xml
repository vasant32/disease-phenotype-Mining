<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ventricular enlargement and histological changes in the cerebrum were studied in various stage after occulusion of the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, no ventricular enlargement occured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, nine dogs out of 12 dogs showed enlargement of the ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hitological examination revealed peeled ependymal layer from subependymal tissue, edematous findings in the periventricular tissue, perivascular gliofibrosis, perivascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, exanguination of plasm, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> in the ventricular wall and cerebral cortex in convexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracellular space in the subependymal tissue, and the space between pial and glial membrane were widened remarkably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two factors were raised by authors as the pathogenesis for ventricular enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One factor was the hydrodynamic disturbance of CSF according to the CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> into the superior sagittal sinus through arachnoid villi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other one was the disturbance of venous circulation due to occlusion of the sinus </plain></SENT>
