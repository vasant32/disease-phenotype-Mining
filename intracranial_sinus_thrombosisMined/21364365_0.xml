<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) has not been previously described in association with use of a combined contraceptive ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old white woman presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> progressively worsening over days and subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and sensory loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right parietal cortical infarction and extensive CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluation for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was unrevealing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sole hypercoagulable risk factor identified was use of a vaginal contraceptive ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was anticoagulated and demonstrated marked clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report the first described case of CVST associated with use of a vaginal contraceptive ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CVST should be recognized as a potentially fatal complication related to this therapy </plain></SENT>
