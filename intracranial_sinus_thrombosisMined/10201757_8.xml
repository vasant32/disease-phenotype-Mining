<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To present etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>) in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To discuss the diagnostic role of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and to evaluate the controversial treatment modalities of anticoagulation, surgical drainage of the infected sinus, and ligation of the internal jugular vein (IJV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans and follow-up visits to document the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1986 and 1996, CT scans of 15 children revealed <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were further investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The etiology could be divided in three groups: group A, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (6); group B, trauma (6); and group C, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were neither symptoms nor clinical findings specifically related to <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> but rather, these were related to the underlying disease or condition (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo>, skull base fractures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by CECT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fusobacterium necrophorum was found in 4 of 6 patients in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early mastoidectomy with incision and drainage of the thrombosed sigmoid sinus was performed in patients in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative intravenous (IV) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was given; however, no ligation of the IJV became necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in group C, protein C or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, or both, was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CECT with adequate window-level settings allows the diagnosis of a <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> with high sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment of choice for septic <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> consists of administration of antibiotics and early surgical drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We recommend anticoagulation therapy in children with septic <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> during their hospitalization </plain></SENT>
