<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of children experiencing their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during a 7-year period in Uppsala-Ã–rebro Health Care Region covering one-fifth of the Swedish population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 51 children (23 boys and 28 girls; median age 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 1.8 per 100,000 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AIS was found in 51% of the children, HS in 41% and cerebral sinus venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 8% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 1.8 per 100,000 children and year, and the primary mortality was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk factors of importance were oral contraceptives, smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in combinations </plain></SENT>
