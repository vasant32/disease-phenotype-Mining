<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We discuss the management of the mother and foetus following this tragic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also discuss the complex medical, legal and ethical issues that arose following maternal brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The central question is whether continuing maternal organ supportive measures in an attempt to prolong gestation to attain foetal viability is appropriate, or whether it constitutes futile care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Successful maintenance of maternal brain somatic function to facilitate foetal maturation in utero has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the gestational age of the foetus is central to resolving this issue, there is no clear upper physiological limit to the prolongation of somatic function following brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, medical experience regarding prolonged somatic support is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the legal rights conferred on the foetus may vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction in which the maternal brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurs and may have important implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A consensus building approach, involving the family, is essential to resolving these potentially conflicting issues </plain></SENT>
