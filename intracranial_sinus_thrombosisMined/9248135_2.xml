<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography is an established radiologic technique which is rapidly becoming useful in imaging the head and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, this imaging modality is important in the diagnosis of sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> caused by otologic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the introduction of antibiotic therapy, the percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> attributed to intracranial complications from otitic disease has decreased from 2.5 to approximately 0.25% of documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, the incidence of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> within this group has decreased, but it is still a serious and potentially lethal condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is suspected clinically when mastoid disease progresses, with picket fence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> pattern, chills, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Definitive diagnosis is necessary before surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Queckenstedt test is unreliable, computed tomography is better suited for demonstrating <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sagittal sinus rather than the sigmoid sinus, and conventional angiography (although it provides excellent visualization) has the hazard of ionizing radiation and requires vessel puncture and the use of intraarterial contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We present two cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sigmoid sinus as an intracranial otologic complication which were diagnosed definitively with magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of magnetic resonance imaging, which showed the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> displaying abnormal signal intensity, and magnetic resonance angiography, which demonstrated the absence of flow in the sinus, was an ideal diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For both patients, treatment consisted of mastoidectomy, sigmoid sinus decompression and antibiotics </plain></SENT>
