<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, local orbital complications are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The employment of antibiotics reduces the incidence of complications but can sometimes conceal their appearance so that diagnosis is delayed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within a brief time span, 8 patients with complicated frontal and ethmoid-maxillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> were diagnosed and treated: 4 cases of periorbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, 2 of subperiorbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and 2 of orbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (one of which with cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Particularly relevant from the diagnostic point of view was the employment of C.T. scan which furnished an accurate definition of the orbit and its surrounding structures which influenced treatment choice </plain></SENT>
