<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The use of commercially available topical hemostatic adjuncts has increased the safety profile of surgery as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cranial surgery has also benefited from the development of numerous agents designed to permit more rapid achievement of hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flowable topical hemostatic agents applied via syringe injection are now commonly employed in many neurosurgical procedures, including cranial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravascular use of these strongly thrombogenic agents is contraindicated, but in certain settings, inadvertent intravascular administration can occur, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and potential dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, there have no reports detailing the presence and incidence of this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cranial surgeries performed at Presbyterian University Hospital by members of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Department of Neurological Surgery between 2007 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> due to inadvertent intravascular administration of flowable topical hemostatic matrix (FTHM) were identified and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Iatrogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> induced by FTHM was identified in 5 (0.1%) of 3969 cranial surgery cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these events occurred in 3318 supratentorial cases, whereas 5 cases of cerebral venous sinus occlusion occurred in 651 infratentorial cases (0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of accidental vessel occlusion was significantly associated with infratentorial surgery, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events occurred in the transverse and/or sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No episodes of inadvertent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> occurred during endoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 patients with FTHM-related cerebral venous sinus occlusion, none developed long-term neurological sequelae referable to the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inadvertent intravascular administration of FTHM is a rare complication associated with cranial surgery that occurs most commonly during infratentorial procedures around the transverse and/or sigmoid sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Modifications in the choice of when to use an FTHM and the method of application may help prevent accidental venous sinus administration </plain></SENT>
