<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively included 25 CVST patients admitted to the university hospital and 53 voluntary subjects as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FVIII and vWF were measured after 6 months when <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean FVIII and vWF levels were significantly higher in the CVST group compared to the control group (126.21 ± 54.69 vs. 91.9 ± 48.8 IU/dl; p = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>012; 157.05 ± 107.74 vs. 94 ± 84%; p = 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using analyses calculating the 95th percentile cut-off values, we found high levels of FVIII in patients compared to controls (29.2 vs. 5%; p = 0.01) and the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was 7.82 (1.46, 41.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for vWF levels, sex and age, the risk remained significantly increased and the odds ratio with 95% CI was 10.5 (1.1, 101.4) (p = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FVIII is one of the most prevalent risk factors of CVST and may be associated with an approximately tenfold increased risk for developing CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect is independent of vWF levels; however, vWF is not an independent risk factor of CVST </plain></SENT>
