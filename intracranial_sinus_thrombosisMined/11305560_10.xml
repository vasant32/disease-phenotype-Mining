<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated clinical applicability of 2D thick-slice, contrast-enhanced subtraction <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (2D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> digital subtraction angiography) with sub-second temporal resolution in cerebrovascular occlusive diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with cerebrovascular occlusive diseases (8 moyamoya diseases, 10 proximal internal carotid occlusions, and 2 sinus thromboses ) were studied with a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> digital subtraction angiography (MRDSA) was performed per 0.97 s continuously just after a bolus injection of 15 ml of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> chelates up to 40 s in sagittal (covering hemisphere) or coronal planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subtraction images were generated at a workstation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated imaging quality and hemodynamic information of MRDSA in comparison with those of routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, non-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and X-ray intra-arterial DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major cerebral arteries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the venous sinuses, and most tributaries were clearly visualized with 2D MRDSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, pure arterial phases were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MRDSA technique demonstrated prolonged circulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinus thromboses</z:e>, distal patent lumen of proximal occlusion, and some collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such hemodynamic information was comparable to that of intra-arterial DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional thick-slice MRDSA with high temporal resolution has a unique ability to demonstrate cerebral hemodynamics equivalent to that of intra-arterial DSA and may play an important role for evaluation of cerebrovascular occlusive diseases </plain></SENT>
