<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This observational study was conducted prospectively during a 2-year period (July 1993 to June 1995) in a preselected population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients admitted to our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">high-risk pregnancy</z:e> unit with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the puerperium were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen levels, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, functional test for activated protein C resistance, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> by polymerase chain reaction were performed on each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven (46.6%) patients were positive for activated protein C resistance (factor V Leiden) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other coagulation studies were negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with activated protein C resistance had a venous thrombotic event, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e>, and only one had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> on the basis of sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two of the activated protein C resistance-negative patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the subgroup with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the puerperium, the incidence of activated protein C resistance (factor V Leiden) was 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the incidence of factor V Leiden in a selected population in whom thrombotic events developed during pregnancy and the puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This small-scale study provides justification for a large cohort study that will identify women with factor V Leiden and determine their risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during pregnancy and the puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We believe that factor V Leiden should be evaluated in conjunction with thrombotic events in the pregnant woman </plain></SENT>
