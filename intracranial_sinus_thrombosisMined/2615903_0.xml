<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) among neurosurgical in-patients, whose ages ranged from 23 to 80, was 0.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our report here is based on five cases of patients with PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of these five patients were over 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They had been admitted because of such reasons as <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp>, spinal cord injury, intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, and venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>Deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) was seen in four but none were diagnosed before they had developed PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased level of consciousness and prolonged bed rest appeared to be common risk factors for PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean duration between admission and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of PE was 31 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although non-specific, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002789'>tachypnea</z:hpo> and hypoxemia were the most common signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a definitive diagnostic procedure, pulmonary angiography was performed in most of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient required surgical embolectomy and others were treated with anticoagulation or fibrinolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent recurrent thromboembolic phenomena, ligation of the inferior vena cava was a useful mode of treatment when anticoagulation was not indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>And this approach seemed to be valid in most neurosurgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PE and DVT were not uncommon complications among Japanese neurosurgical patients and they can be treated successfully in collaboration with a cardiovascular surgeon if the diagnosis can be made correctly </plain></SENT>
