<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of skull-base vasculature has traditionally been performed with angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four-vessel angiography is an invasive procedure that subjects the patient to the potential risks of vascular injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, renal damage, <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp>, and radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The development of gradient-recall echo pulse sequence in MRI provides a means to evaluate the vasculature with a noninvasive, low-risk technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We review the experience of the House Ear Clinic with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in evaluating cranial-base abnormalities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002668'>paragangliomas</z:hpo>, aberrant vessels, and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on a review of 25 cases, we conclude that MRA is a useful procedure for evaluation of major arteries, veins, and dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
