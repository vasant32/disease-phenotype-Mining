<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> persisted despite biochemical improvement and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">6th nerve palsy</z:e> became evident on Day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Day 5, sudden deterioration in mental status to the point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> with loss of airway protective reflexes prompted repeat imaging including magnetic resonance venography which demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal, straight, right transverse, right sigmoid and proximal posterior aspect of the left transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selective thrombolysis using rTPA was performed emergently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete lysis of the thrombosed veins was observed within 35 hours </plain></SENT>
