<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> velocity mapping was used to examine 14 healthy volunteers, 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>), 3 patients with high pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (HPH), and 11 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean blood flow was 443 ml/min in healthy volunteers with a tendency towards reduced blood flow with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> patients significantly lower superior sagittal sinus blood flow values were found, but this difference was no longer significant when patients and controls were matched for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In HPH and IIH patients blood flow and velocity were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus the blood flow was reduced to 40 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> velocity mapping methods may be of value in the assessment of blood flow in the dural sinuses in various pathologies resulting in dural sinus occlusion, such as dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and for following the progress of these patients while undergoing treatment </plain></SENT>
