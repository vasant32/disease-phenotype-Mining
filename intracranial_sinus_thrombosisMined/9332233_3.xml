<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this project was to study the anatomical characteristics of intracerebral haematoma (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) in order to determine features that may negate the need for angiography in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was prospective and designed to investigate the underlying cause of non-traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in 100 cases assessed by conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if there was a history of trauma or known pre-existing brain abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined with CT and angiography within 4 days of the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) were diagnosed on the initial angiogram in 49% of cases: 27 <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> and 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>Vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> were found most frequently in the under-40 age group and in cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, intraventricular haemorrhage or extracerebral haematoma accompanied the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The temporal lobe was the most frequent anatomical location (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When a temporal lobe haematoma extended into the Sylvian fissure from the inferior pole of the temporal lobe or when it was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, structural abnormalities were found in over 90% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are groups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in whom the CT features are highly suggestive of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If the initial angiography is negative in these cases, careful follow up by repeat angiography and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, potentially treatable abnormalities cannot be excluded with certainty by the distribution of the haematoma on CT alone, even if there is a history of pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
