<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Operation may be hazardous for lesions in this area, radical resection is seldom obtained, and other treatments are often needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> occur at this location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiological examination may not be diagnostic so that a histopathological diagnosis is often needed before treatment can be recommended for the individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If surgical resection is less feasible a biopsy will be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe a technique for image-guided percutaneous biopsy through the oval foramen ovale and its use in two patients with a cavernous sinus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also describe and highlight the importance of pre- and intraoperative CT imaging in obtaining a safe and conclusive biopsy </plain></SENT>
