<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a rare case of a patient who developed a venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, which was diagnosed on CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DCCF predominantly drained through a frontobasal cortical vein into the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The shunt volume was small and was therefore thought not to be sufficient to explain the massive ocular signs, such as severe exophthalmus and reduction of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore postulated a venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> owing to a secondary spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of the draining venous pathways to be responsible for the ocular signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under anticoagulative medication, the patient's signs and symptoms improved gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control angiography after 3 months showed that the DCCF had disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the presence of DCCF, anticoagulation should always be considered when a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is suspected </plain></SENT>
