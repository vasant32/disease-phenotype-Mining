<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although cerebral venous sinus occlusion (CVSO) is reported to be associated with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, its incidence or significance in head trauma is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated with CT venography the incidence of posttraumatic CVSO, its clinical course, and relation to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study comprised 97 consecutive patients admitted to our Trauma Center from 2002 through 2008 with skull fracture of the petrous portion of the temporal bone or that crossed the dural sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with CVSO were examined with CT venography and followed up with CT venography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relation of CVSO to patient outcome and incidence of "talk and deteriorate" was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CVSO was observed in 22 of 97 patients (22.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was significantly higher in the CVSO group versus no-CVSO group (50.0% vs. 9.3%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence of lethal intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was higher in the CVSO versus no-CVSO group (40.9% vs. 5.3%, p &lt; 0.001), although there was no difference in Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score at admission between the two groups (CVSO group, 8 +/- 5 vs. no-CVSO group, 10 +/- 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization without treatment for CVSO occurred by 6 months in 9 of the 11 survivors (81.8%) who could be followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CVSO incidence after head injury was much higher than ever thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was associated with mortality and lethal intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, indicating that CVSO may induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase in intracranial pressure in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early recognition of CVSO may be important to predict deterioration after admission and for starting immediate treatment </plain></SENT>
