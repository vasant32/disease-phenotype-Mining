<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Although the majority of patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) obtain an optimistic clinical outcome after <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment, there remains a subgroup of patients who do not respond to conventional anticoagulation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients, especially younger people, as documented by hospital-based studies, have a high morbidity and mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: To verify the safety and efficacy of a dual mechanical thrombectomy with thrombolysis treatment modality option in patients with severe CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: 52 patients diagnosed as CVST were enrolled and treated with mechanical thrombectomy combined with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent urokinase 100 ∼1500×10 IU intravenous sinus injection via a jugular catheter after confirming diagnoses of CVST using either MRI/MRV or DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information obtained on the patients included recanalization status of venous sinuses as evaluated by MRV or DSA at admission, during operation, and at 3 and 6 months follow-up after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The percentage of patients that showed complete and partial recanalization were 87% and 6%, respectively, after mechanical thrombectomy combined with thrombolysis treatment; 8% of the patients showed no recanilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mRS scores were 1.0±0.9, 0.85±0.63, and 0.37±0.53 for discharge, and 3 and 6 month follow-up, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 6 patients died despite receiving aggressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No cases of relapse occurred after 3 to 6 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: Thrombectomy combined with thrombolysis is a safe and valid treatment modality to use in severe CVST cases or in intractable patients that have shown no adequate response to antithrombotic drugs </plain></SENT>
