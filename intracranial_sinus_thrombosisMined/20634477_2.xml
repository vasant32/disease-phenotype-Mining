<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Time to a second cerebral or systemic venous thrombotic event and risk factors for recurrence have not been investigated in large prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp>, which included 624 patients with CVT followed up for a median of 13.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptomatic VTEs and CVT recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential predictors of recurrence, including demographic characteristics, imaging features, thrombophilic abnormalities, other risk factors for CVT, and anticoagulation, were analyzed by Cox survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 624 included patients, 36 (5.8%) had at least 1 venous thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of VTEs after the initial CVT was 4.1 per 100 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> VTEs, 63.2% (n=24) occurred within the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (2.2%) had an episode of recurrent CVT and the rate of recurrence was 1.5 per 100 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine (64.3%) of these CVT recurrences occurred within the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Male gender (hazard ratios=2.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 5.1; P=0.004) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocythemia</z:e> (hazard ratios=4.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 12.7; P=0.005) were the only factors associated with a significant higher risk of VTEs in multivariate survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of recurrence of CVT is low but is moderate for other VTEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> after CVT is more frequent among men and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocythemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
