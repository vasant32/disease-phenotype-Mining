<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The infant presented at 4 weeks of age with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112174" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">panencephalitis</z:e>, diffuse intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and straight sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had been vaccinated against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No other cause was found and maternal prenatal care was unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infant's screening ANA test by ELISA was positive at 6 weeks with specificity for ssDNA, Sm, and nRNP/Sm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 8 weeks antibodies to dsDNA and centromere were detected as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 8 months, she still had slightly elevated anti-dsDNA, Sm, and nRNP/Sm antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ANA test by immunofluorescence was abnormal at 8 weeks through 13 weeks with centromere and then homogeneous pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on similarities with other reported cases, we speculate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination may have been involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
