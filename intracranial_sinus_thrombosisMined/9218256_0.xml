<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rare case of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (DAVF) in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), the transverse sinus and the sigmoid sinus is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 64-year-old man, who had had an episode of temporary visual disturbance after moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> for a week about 20 years before, was aware of loss of visual acuity and reduced field of view in the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When he was introduced to our outpatient service, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) was detected by lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms showed bilateral DAVFs both in the posterior fossa and the SSS concomitant with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus and SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, endovascular transarterial embolization through bilateral occipital, posterior auricular and left middle meningeal, superior temporal arteries was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, transvenous thrombolytic therapy using a catheter inserted into SSS resulted in the improvement of his visual problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although he was discharged at once, he was readmitted to our department with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Foster Kennedy syndrome</z:e> and increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms showed recurrence of both DAVF and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transarterial embolization was performed again resulting in a significant reduction of DAVF, and his visual acuity was recovered to a moderate degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The origin of DAVF is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although two theories, "congenital" and "acquired", are put forward, it has been thought that both factors play important roles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our case, the patient had stenosis in the jugular canal portions of the sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> seemed to have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is thought that increased intrasinus pressure may have lead to communication with surrounding arteries through existing dural vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We applied transvenous thrombolytic therapy in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our result suggests that we should consider this therapy for some cases of DAVF </plain></SENT>
