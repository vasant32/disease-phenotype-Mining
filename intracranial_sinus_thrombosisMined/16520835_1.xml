<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Septic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CST) is a rare and fatal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations in the early stage are nonspecific, and the sensitivity of cranial axial computed tomography (CT) with thick section is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the clinical manifestation and neuroimaging findings in patients with septic CST in a medical center in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective case series included nine patients with septic CST who had typical symptoms and clinical course, evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and imaging studies which demonstrated cavernous sinus lesion, and who were treated between 1995 and 2003 at National Taiwan University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven (77.8 %) patients were more than 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five (55.6%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and three (33.3%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were associated with paranasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent initial symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (66.7%), followed by ophthalmic complaints (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, 55.6%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, 55.6%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> (44.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial cranial images failed to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or coronal contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) with thin section confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fungi were the most common pathogens (55.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The inhospital case-fatality rate was high (44.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the high case-fatality rate and low yield rate of blood cultures, fungal CST should be suspected in an immunocompromised patient with ophthalmic complaints that progress from <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> to the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Coronal thin-section CECT may be a useful alternative to MRI as a diagnostic modality for this condition </plain></SENT>
