<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> often accompanies or precedes the development of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because thrombophilic abnormalities can contribute to sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, we investigated the prevalence of such abnormalities and of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thrombophilic factors were measured in 18 patients with DAVFs treated with embolization at our university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control data were obtained from patients with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to sinus occlusion, we investigated prothrombin time, activated thromboplastin time, platelet count, and fibrinogen, platelet, antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, anticardiolipin antibody, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I complex antibody, and D-dimer levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 18 patients with DAVFs, 16 had abnormal D-dimer levels, whereas the mean values for other thrombophilic factors were nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>D-dimer levels were significantly higher in preoperative DAVF patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the mean value of D-dimer was higher in patients with sinus occlusion than in those without it (3.33 versus 1.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>D-dimer levels rose after embolization in eight out of 10 serially tested patients, but, on average, the change was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In clinically cured patients treated more than 3 months before, D-dimer was lower than in preoperative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: D-dimer is a very sensitive indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, suggesting that elevations in patients with DAVFs are likely to reflect sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>D-dimer values decreased and nearly normalized in clinically cured patients during a long-term follow-up period, a finding consistent with completion of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and cure of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To clarify the correlation between DAVF and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from the aspect of etiology, we should thoroughly check the variation in the concentration of the thrombophilic factors in the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> sinus occlusion to know the variation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> formation in the further study </plain></SENT>
