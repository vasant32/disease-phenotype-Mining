<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Almost half of the patients were younger than 18 years, and most were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common intracranial complication was brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and extradural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>Cholesteatoma</z:hpo> was found in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the complications were confirmed by computed tomography, initial treatment consisted of intravenous systemic antibiotics followed by mastoid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical approach was determined by the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear disease</z:e>, not by the type of neurologic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in 16 patients, tympanomastoidectomy in 6, and myringotomy in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant morbidity, mortality, recurrence, or residual neurologic deficit was observed at the 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early surgical intervention is important in achieving positive outcomes in patients with such intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
