<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been mostly reported in mountain climbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 19-yr-old female, working as a high-altitude chamber instructor, who presented with severe frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> which persisted for a month following routine high altitude chamber training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was in generally good health and was using oral contraceptives for 3 yr prior to the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to the unremitting nature of the symptoms, the patient was admitted to a neurology department, and computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sagittal and transverse sinus vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were diagnosed and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was initiated (low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> followed by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, a slow symptomatic improvement was observed, and the patient was discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On discharge, it was recommended she continue oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A complete coagulation screening panel was performed, which was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the relation between high altitude exposure and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> is well known, this is the first time a case of sinus vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has been reported after high altitude chamber training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Careful history and closely monitored medical follow-up should be performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> designated staff exposed to simulated altitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even though there is no conclusive evidence regarding it, we suggest, as a matter of caution, that women using oral contraceptives should consider their risks before deciding to undertake exposure to simulated altitude in chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Literature review and detailed recommendations for prevention are provided </plain></SENT>
