<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> (ISCVT) cohort (624 patients with cerebral vein and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>), we analyzed the predictors and the impact on outcome of diagnostic delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was a modified Rankin Scale score &gt;2 at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 at the end of follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and visual deficits (visual acuity or visual field) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median delay was 7 days (interquartile range, 3 to 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with disturbance of consciousness (P&lt;0.001) and of mental status (P=0.042), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (&lt;0.001), and with parenchymal lesions on admission CT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (P&lt;0.001) were diagnosed earlier, whereas men (P=0.01) and those with isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome (P=0.04) were diagnosed later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between patients diagnosed earlier and later than the median delay, no statistically significant differences were found in the primary (P=0.33) and in secondary outcomes: modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 (P=0.86) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (P=0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persistent visual deficits were more frequent in patients diagnosed later (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome, modified Rankin Scale score &gt;2 at the end of follow-up was more frequent in patients diagnosed later (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic delay was considerable in this cohort and was associated with an increased risk of visual deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome, diagnostic delay was also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency </plain></SENT>
