<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, the aim of this chat review was to analyze the demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of otogenic sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Especially the role of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the therapy of septic intracranial sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in children should be illuminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients were included in this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient was treated completely conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients underwent surgical treatment consisting of mastoidectomy (n=5), additional thrombectomy (n=3) and ligation of the internal jugular vein (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received intravenous antibiotics and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered for three days after surgery followed by an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy with low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the anti-factor-Xa-plasma-levels were monitored during anticoagulation in short term intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no complications related to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were treated without thrombectomy or ligation of the internal jugular vein and in the case of complete conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Simple mastoidectomy combined with broad spectrum antibiotics is the therapy of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> represent a safe treatment option if they are administered correctly </plain></SENT>
