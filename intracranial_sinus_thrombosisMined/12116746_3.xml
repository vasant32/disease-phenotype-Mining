<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> with associated venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> appears to differ from that of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe DWI findings in venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed 3 adults with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> who underwent DWI and magnetic resonance imaging within 24 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWI was obtained at 1.5 T using the multishot echo planar technique (TR = 8000, TE = 97, field of view = 30 x 19 cm, slice thickness = 6.0 mm, interslice gap = 0.5 mm, matrix 128 x 128, NEX = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diffusion gradients were applied in 3 orthogonal directions with 3 increasing b values (0-1000 s/mm2) to create average (trace) DWI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis and displayed as <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DWI showed hyperintensities in patients 1 and 2 and hypointensity in patient 3 in corresponding to parenchymal lesions on conventional images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As compared to the homologous uninvolved location in the contralateral hemisphere, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were decreased (0.53 x 10(-3) mm2/s [patient 1] and 0.68 x 10(-3) mm2/s [patient 2]) and increased (1.1 x 10(-3) mm2/s [patient 3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio of the lesion in the involved to uninvolved side was 88% (patient 1), 81% (patient 2), and 120% (patient 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> cerebral venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> may contain cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and/or vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on DWI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DWI may be helpful in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in cases with cryptic presentations </plain></SENT>
