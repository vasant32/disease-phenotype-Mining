<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approaches to the cerebellar-pontine angle and petroclival region can be challenging due to intervening eloquent neurovascular structures and cerebellar retraction required to view this anatomic compartment with the standard retrosigmoid technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As previously described [11], the extended retrosigmoid provides additional access to space ventral to the brainstem through mobilization of the sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our further experience and modifications of this approach for neoplastic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The standard craniotomy is utilized, and the burr holes are placed slightly beyond the transverse sinus as well as the transverse-sigmoid junction and down towards the foramen magnum, as low as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another burr hole is placed over the cerebral hemisphere to facilitate the dural dissection below the bone flap and over the transverse and sigmoid sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then perform a standard retrosigmoid craniotomy with a craniotome and the transverse and sigmoid sinuses are skeletonized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the sigmoid sinus can then mobilized anteriorly to provide an unobstructed view in line with the petrous bone, while exposure of the transverse sinus provides access to the tentorium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (March 2006-July 2008) underwent this approach to manage neoplastic lesions, including five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>schwannomas</z:hpo>, one epidermoid, and four intra-axial metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nine extra-axial lesions were predominantly in the cerebellar-pontine angle with extension medial to the seventh/eighth nerve complex to the petroclival region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gross total resection was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The primary complication due to the exposure was a clinically asymptomatic sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Requiring a fundamental change in the management of the venous sinuses, the extended retrosigmoid craniotomy permits mobilization of the sigmoid and transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this process, the entire cerebellar-pontine angle extending from the tentorium to the foramen magnum can be visualized with minimal cerebellar retraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technical modification over the standard retrosigmoid approach may provide a useful advantage to neurosurgeons dealing with these complex lesions </plain></SENT>
