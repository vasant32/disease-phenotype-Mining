<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration granted approval to pegaspargase (Oncaspar; Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ; hereafter, O) for the first-line treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) as a component of a multiagent chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>O was previously approved in February 1994 for the treatment of patients with ALL who were hypersensitive to native forms of L-asparaginase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The trial supporting this new indication was an open label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that enrolled 118 children (age, 1-9 years) with previously untreated, standard risk ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received either native Escherichia coli asparaginase (Elspar; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ; hereafter, E) or O along with multiagent chemotherapy during remission induction and delayed intensification (DI) phases of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>O, at a dose of 2,500 IU/m(2), was administered i.m. on day 3 of the 4-week induction phase and on day 3 of each of two 8-week DI phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>E, at a dose of 6,000 IU/m(2), was administered i.m. three times weekly for nine doses during induction and for six doses during each DI phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study allowed direct comparison of O and E for asparagine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, asparaginase activity, and development of asparaginase antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An unplanned comparison of event-free survival (EFS) was conducted to rule out a deleterious O efficacy effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following induction and DI treatment there was complete (&lt;/=1 microM) or moderate (1-10 microM) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of serum asparagine levels in the large majority of samples tested over the 4-week period in both O-treated and E-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of cerebrospinal fluid asparagine levels during induction was similar between O-treated and E-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of days asparaginase activity exceeded &gt;0.03 IU/ml in O-treated subjects was greater than the number of days in E-treated subjects during both the induction and DI phases of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation, however, between asparaginase activity and serum asparagine levels, making the former determination less clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Using the protocol-prespecified threshold for a positive result of &gt;2.5 times the control, 7 of 56 (12%) O subjects tested at any time during the study demonstrated antiasparaginase antibodies and 16 of 57 (28%) E subjects tested at any time during the study had antiasparaginase antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In both study arms EFS was in the range of 80% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The most serious, sometimes fatal, O toxicities were <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp>, other serious allergic reactions, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (including sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were allergic reactions (including <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated transaminases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
