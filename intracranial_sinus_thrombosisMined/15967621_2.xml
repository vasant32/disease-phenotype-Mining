<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined six patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (n = 2), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> combined with sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 4) (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms were non-specific (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cephalea, <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002167'>speech disorder</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> examinations were performed on a 1.5 T system (Magnetom Symphony, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), maximum gradient field strength 30 mT/m, minimal gradient rise time 450 micros, according to the following protocol: Transverse T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE), fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T1-weighted spin-echo (SE), before and after administration of contrast medium, T2*-weighted conventional gradient-echo (GRE), T2*-weighted spin-echo echo planar imaging (SE EPI), both without and with diffusion weighting as well as two-dimensional (2D) venous time-of-flight (TOF) MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The venous thromboses were best detectable in the T2*-weighted conventional GRE sequence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the CVT was discernible only in this sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was well discernible only in the T2*-weighted GRE sequence in only one case; in the remaining cases it was detectable only with difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For these cases, other sequences such as SE, diffusion-weighted, or 2D-TOF-MRA sequence were superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T2*-weighted conventional GRE sequence was superior to the T2*-weighted SE EPI sequence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To sum up, it can be concluded, that T2*-weighted conventional GRE sequences are possibly the best method of detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical vein thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it seems to be of benefit to integrate a T2*-weighted conventional GRE sequence into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-protocol for the diagnosis of isolated cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
