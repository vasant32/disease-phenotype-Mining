<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three types of signal abnormalities were observed in thrombosed sinuses: 1) isosignal on T1-weighted sequence and low-intensity signal on T2-weighted sequence (early stage); 2) high-intensity signal on T1-and T2-weighted sequences (intermediate stage); 3) isosignal on T1-weighted sequence and high-intensity signal on T2-weighted sequence (late stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signal abnormalities in dural sinuses enabling CVT to be diagnosed were absent in 2 out of 53 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six out of 53 patients had venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These lesions were haemorrhagic in 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI made it possible to follow the course of CVT in 15 cases, showing partial or complete recanalization of the occluded sinuses in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study confirmed that MRI is an excellent non-invasive method to explore CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It diagnoses the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, studies parenchymal lesions and follows the course of CVT under treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, MRI is less sensitive than arteriography, particularly in cases of CVT involving only the cortical veins </plain></SENT>
