<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked at the development of walking in a retrospective and consecutive cohort study of 88 term and near-term neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models to assess (1) sex, (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type (arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>), (3) number of cerebral hemispheres with infarction, and (4) presence of neonatal comorbidity as predictors of the probability over time of starting to walk independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These variables were assessed as predictors of parent-reported gait normality using the chi-square test on 2 x 2 contingency tables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five of 83 survivors (90.4%, 95% confidence interval = 81.9-95.7) walked with a median time of first steps at 13 months of age (95% confidence interval = 12-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were associated with a lower probability over time of initiating independent walking (hazard ratio = 0.41, P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parents reported <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gait for 58 of 75 walkers (77.3%, 95% confidence interval = 67.8-86.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No variables predicted parent-reported gait normality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that most survivors of neonatal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> walk with a gait that appears <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to parents, but bilateral infarctions decrease the probability over time of starting to walk independently </plain></SENT>
