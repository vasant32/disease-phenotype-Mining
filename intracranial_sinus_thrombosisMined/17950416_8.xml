<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study objective was to document findings on magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance venography in cases of suspected neonatal sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective search of the institutional database was performed to find neonates whose cranial computed tomography raised the suspicion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Documented abnormalities were detected on magnetic resonance venography, diffusion-weighted imaging, and T(2)-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 15 neonates with suspicious computed tomography studies, 2 had a definite intraluminal clot in the deep venous system; the remainder showed decreased flow-related enhancement within the dural venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases, the sinus was compressed by adjacent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> or sutural diastasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients, 5 had parenchymal abnormalities (2 of these had definite intraluminal clot) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal abnormalities were classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (3/5), cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (3/5), or vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (1/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraluminal clot in the newborn is more often identified in the deep than in the superficial venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With evidence of venous injury in the absence of identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, it is possible that either clots dissolve quickly, escaping detection, or that the superficial venous system is vulnerable to mechanical forces during delivery </plain></SENT>
