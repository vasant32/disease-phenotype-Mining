<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To make a retrospective study of the clinical, etiological, diagnostic and prognostic features of cerebral vein and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) diagnosed at our University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a systematic research of the clinical records of our University Hospital's electronic database (1977-2009) using the key words &lt;&lt;cerebral vein or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>&gt;&gt; </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-five possible cases were found, and 16 were excluded due to alternative or uncertain diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine patients (43 females), median age of 46 years (2-82), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hereditary or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was detected in 22 patients (27.8%): prothrombin G20210A mutation (10), factor V Leyden (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> (2), homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation (1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (7) and hematological conditions (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CVST was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 17 cases, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in 9, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in 13, treatment with prothrombotic drugs in 20 (including substitutive/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> hormones and oral contraceptives) and other causes in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cases were idiopathic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation was intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 83.5%, focal deficits in 45.6% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in 12.6 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transverse (57%) and superior sagittal sinus (49.4%) were the most commonly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> occurred in 25.3%, venous infarction in 41% and severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 22.8 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Up to 31.6 % required surgical drainage, decompressive craniectomy or ventricular drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine cases associated peripheral venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and 4 CVST recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evolution was favorable (modified Rankin scale 0-2 at 3 months) in 74.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 13.9% (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic and infectious origin was significantly associated with mortality and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe a large retrospective series of CVST where infectious and neoplastic etiologies were linked to an unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
