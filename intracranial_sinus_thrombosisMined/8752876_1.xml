<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 73-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of disturbed consciousness and left-sided motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic scans demonstrated a hemorrhagic infarction in the right parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Right carotid angiograms showed both the posterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the entire left transverse sinus simultaneously occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiograms revealed an enlarged occipital artery, which had direct communications to the left sigmoid sinus and the superior petrosal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were consistent with dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (D-AVF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The laboratory examinations yieled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was managed conservatively with glyceol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> for four weeks and eventually recovered with complete resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography carried out 6 weeks later showed the SSS, partially stenotic, but recanalized with no evidence of venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The D-AVF still remained opacified, but there was a marked reduction in retrograde flow to the sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further repeated angiograms obtained at 10 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> confirmed complete recanalization of the SSS and disappearance of the D-AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the timing of the angiographies, we considered that the sinus occlusion was caused by the high arterial flow to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and its disappearance made recanalization of SSS possible </plain></SENT>
