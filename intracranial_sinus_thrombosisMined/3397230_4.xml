<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three cases of ethmoidities with orbital complications were reviewed to determine the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and the benefit of CT scans in planning treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the Schramm et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1982 criteria of orbital involvement with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ethmoiditis</z:e>: periorbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> with chemosis (PCC)-9, and orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> (OC)-11, subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (SPA)-9, and orbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>)-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients received CT scans acutely for diagnostic purposes and demonstrated an 84% accuracy with the final clinical groupings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 33 patients, 9 had a shift in clinical classification based on the CT scan result interpreted by the Radiology Department or surgical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no false positives in the periorbital or orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> patients, and no false negatives in the subperiosteal and orbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus classification changes caused no change from medical to surgical treatment in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is that a knowledgeable clinical exam established the correct grouping in 70% of the patients versus 82% with the CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An urgent CT scan is advised for patients in clinical groups SPA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, or cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CST) to determine the imminent need for surgery, as the cases may be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with PC or PCC can be managed medically with elective CT scans not routinely indicated </plain></SENT>
