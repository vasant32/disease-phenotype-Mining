<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The high morbidity and mortality rates associated with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may be heightened by a delay in diagnosis, which necessitates prompt and effective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditional treatment consists of the initiation of systemic anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and, more recently, regional thrombolysis with direct endovascular infusion of thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience in a series of five patients in whom we accomplished mechanical clot lysis with the combination of a rheolytic device and balloon catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were treated with a combination of pharmacological and mechanical thrombolysis with the 5-French Angiolet rheolytic catheter (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, MN) and balloon catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The success of the procedure was determined by resolution of or improvement in the patient's neurological examination results and imaging features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients demonstrated immediate improvement as observed on imaging studies or in terms of neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients required more than one intervention, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient continued to improve after the final intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the five patients continued to experience mild residual neurological deficits, and two patients experienced complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient had a delayed recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that required multiple interventions, and the patient has significant neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Navigation of the dural sinuses was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the use of a microcatheter and was possible to a variable degree with the rheolytic catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Known complications of the procedures included two pseudoaneurysms at the femoral puncture site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mechanical clot lysis is a powerful technique for immediate restoration of antegrade venous flow in dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In most patients, the superior sagittal sinuses and contralateral transverse sinuses could be accessed with the 5-French rheolytic catheter </plain></SENT>
