<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When showing a malignant clinical course despite <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, new endovascular techniques and technology allow the possibility of more aggressive thrombolysis and thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present a case of recanalization of an extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> using a new endovascular thromboaspiration device, the Penumbra System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CVST in children is a rare but potentially lethal disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When showing a malignant progression despite <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, the use of local thrombolytics and thrombectomy procedures might provide therapeutic solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 16-year-old girl presented with signs and symptoms of a hemorrhagic cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and showed progression despite full dose <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evolution being attributed to increasing mass effect, decompressive surgery was performed without clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further brain imaging demonstrated progression of the sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeated local thrombectomy with the Penumbra thrombectomy system and continuous, relatively low dose local thrombolysis was performed during a period of 60 h, resulting in recanalization and clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The methodology of combined thromboaspiration and thrombolysis is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel method for revascularization using the Penumbra System in combination with long-term, relatively low dose thrombolysis, in the setting of both clinically and morphologically progressive, hemorrhagic sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The procedure proved to be both safe and effective and may be considered in the future for patients with progressive sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> despite adequate medical therapy </plain></SENT>
