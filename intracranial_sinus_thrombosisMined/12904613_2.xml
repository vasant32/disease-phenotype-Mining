<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A general, public hospital serving a population of approximately 181,000 children in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hong Kong Chinese children under the age of 15 years who were diagnosed with a symptomatic venous thromboembolic event between 1995 and 2000 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on clinical features, predisposing factors, treatment, and outcome were obtained from review of hospital medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight children (five girls and three boys) of mean age 11.5 years (range, 0-14.7 years) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (n=4, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in one), superior vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=1), and cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predisposing factors included hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> (n=2), anticardiolipin antibodies (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (n=3), recent neurosurgery (n=2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n=1), with multiple predisposing factors seen in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was prescribed in five patients, and long-term <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy was required in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children, but one patient had a recurrence after cessation of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy, and one patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-thrombotic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rate of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> in Hong Kong Chinese children was comparable to that seen in Caucasian children, with an annual incidence of 0.74 per 100,000 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Predisposing factors, including hereditary prothrombotic conditions, were common </plain></SENT>
