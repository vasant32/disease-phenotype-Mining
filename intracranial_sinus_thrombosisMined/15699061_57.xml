<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data on the 13 children with bland infarction and the 12 with haemorrhage in the context of CSVT were compared with those from 88 children with ischaemic (AIS) and 24 with haemorrhagic (AHS) arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multiple logistic regression, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>, parietal infarction and lack of caudate involvement independently predicted CSVT rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
