<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the cats were sacrificed 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 72 or 120 hours after sinus-vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the degree of occluded region, the cats were divided into two groups; group A (GA) and B (GB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GA showed only superior sagittal sinus occlusion, while many cortical veins were also occluded in GB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No EB nor histological changes were found in 13 cats of GA and 4 sham operated cats, while EB distribution was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 cats of GB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other 3 cats of GA showed a little EB in gyrus lateralis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EB distribution of GB were divided into two types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 1 showed EB mainly in the cortical gray matter, while type 2 showed massive EB extravasation in the white matter as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Edematous changes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in its resolution phase, were observed in type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, EB free zone was formed along with U-fiber zone (cortico-medullary junction) in the cats of later phase (72 hours after occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings of EB extension in the type 1 means the existence of blockage against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> evolution from cortex toward subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cats of type 2 showed fulminant hemorrhagic changes which appeared depend on time interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although occurrence of pathological changes were rather earlier than that of cases of clinical cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, this pathological findings demonstrated the typical character of venous hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the similarity and difference between this model and clinical case of sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>And the possible function of the U-fiber zone in the corticomedullary junction against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> evolution was suggested </plain></SENT>
