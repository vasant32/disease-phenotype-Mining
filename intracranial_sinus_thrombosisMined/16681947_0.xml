<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine New Zealand white rabbits were made into models of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with the superior sagittal sinus ligated and injected with suspension of cephalin kaolin and cephalin, and then were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n = 15), anticoagulation group (n = 12, infused with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> 2 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1) via external carotid venous for 5 days), and thrombolysis group (n = 12, injected with urokinase 4000 Uxkg(-1)xd(-1) via carotid artery for 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler scanning was used to determine the local cerebral blood flow before ligation, 20 and 90 min after ligation, and at the end of experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five rabbits of the control group per each of the 3 time points (before ligation, 12 h after ligation, and at the end of experiment) were killed to collect the tissues of cerebral cortex in front of the ligated part to determine the brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the remaining rabbits were killed within 24 hours after the end of experiment to determine the brain water content and undergo microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The local cerebral blood flow of the thrombolysis group was 94.8% +/- 0.3%, significantly higher than those of the anticoagulation group (88.6% +/- 0.3%) and control group (80.9% +/- 0.3%) (both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain water content of the thrombolysis group was 78.9% +/- 0.3%, significantly lower than those of the anticoagulation group (81.8% +/- 0.7%) and control group (82.1% +/- 1.0%) (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improving the local blood flow and reducing the brain water content, injection of urokinase via carotid artery is effective in treatment of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
