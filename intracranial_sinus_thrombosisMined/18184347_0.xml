<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A clinic-based prospective case-register study was conducted from 2001 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hundred and twenty-two consecutive definite CVST patients (26 men and 96 women) treated in two major neurological centres of Isfahan, Iran, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Part of examination included an assessment of CVST including conventional angiography and/or magnetic resonance imaging and self-reported medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Population data were obtained from the 1996 Iran Census </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (standard deviation) age of participants was 35.5 (11.9) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual frequency (95% confidence interval) of CVST was 12.3 (10.1, 14.5) per million in a population of 2,472,751, with higher rate in women than in men [19.9 (15.5, 23.9) women and 5.1 (3.2, 7.1) men] and with increasing age in women (up to 50 years), but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The female/male ratio was 3.9 (2.5-6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The monthly frequency of CVST ranged from 0.6 per million (0.1, 1.1) in August to 2.1 (1.2, 3.0) in September </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The seasonal CVST rate ranged from 2.2 per million (1.3, 3.2) in summer to 4.3 (3.1, 5.7) in autumn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The differences were statistically significant either for the months or season (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show the CVST frequency in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More women than men are present with CVST and its frequency increased during autumn </plain></SENT>
