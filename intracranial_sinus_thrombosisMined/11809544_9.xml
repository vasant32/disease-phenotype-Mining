<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose: To determine the frequency of hypointense appearance of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on T2-weighted images, which may mimic a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow void, and when possible correlate with appearance on T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Materials: Retrospective review of radiology files showed 51 patients with a discharge diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging during the period 1986-1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These images were reviewed by an experienced neuroradiologist for appearance on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This process yielded five cases in which a hypointense appearance on this pulse sequence simulated a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow void </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional two cases were added from the teaching files of two other institutions giving a total of seven cases (13% of studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting study population consisted of five women and two men (mean age 27.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T1 weighted images were available in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography was available, but not T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was based solely on absence of flow void on T1-weighted images in one case, solely on absence of flow void on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in two cases and absence of flow void on T1-weighted images in conjunction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography or gradient echo findings in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were obtained on a 1.5 T magnet (GE Medical Systems; Milwaukee, Wisconsin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients hypointense signal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was isointense with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow voids in other dural sinuses on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in which T1-weighted images were available, the signal intensity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was isointense to gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Hypointense appearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> on T2-weighted images is a potential pitfall in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in this stage of evolution appears isointense to gray matter on T1-weighted images, careful attention must be paid to other sequences to avoid this pitfall </plain></SENT>
