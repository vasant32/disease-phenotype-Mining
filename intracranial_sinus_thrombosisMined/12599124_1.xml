<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive study involving the evaluation of the medical records of patients that met the following criteria: over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of TCVS confirmed by CAT scan or cranial MRI, the absence of a history of intracranial surgery in the previous six months and absence of a history of intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 15 patients (14 females and one male) were found with an average age of 28.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time required for the development of the most frequent symptoms was 1 10 days (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The usual presentation was a syndrome of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with focalisation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were identified in 13 patients (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCVS was diagnosed by cranial MRI in the case of 14 patients (93%), by CAT scanning in one (7%) and this was also used to orient diagnosis in 12 cases (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequently affected sinuses were the superior longitudinal and transverse, in 10 cases each (66%), and venous infarctions were also detected in 10 patients (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patients in whom we were able to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorders</z:e>, it was found that the only individual who displayed activated protein C resistance was positive, three out of four patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> and four out of six had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCVS presents as an intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome and it is possible to find risk factors in as many as 85% of the cases </plain></SENT>
