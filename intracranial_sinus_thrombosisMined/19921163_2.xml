<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animal models help us to understand the underlying pathophysiology of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate a well-established model for sinus sagittalis (SSS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> using micro- and nanocomputed tomography (CT) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was performed in four rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After contrast perfusion, brains were isolated and scanned using micro-CT at (8 microm)(3) voxel size to generate 3D images of the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For more detailed information on vascular perfusion territories, nano-CT imaging was performed to investigate the boundary layer of contrast-enhanced vessels and the occluded veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The venous and arterial vascular volume fraction and gray scale measurements were obtained in the SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> group and compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significance of differences in vascular volume fraction and gray scale measurements was tested with analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were complemented with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Micro-CT proved to accurately visualize and differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> territories performed in the SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 3D micro-CT provided quantitative information on arterial and venous vascular volume fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Micro-CT imaging enables a total 3D visualization of complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventricle rupture</z:e>) in the SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We established gray scale measurements by which focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> could be radiographically categorized (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using nano-CT, the interface of contrast-perfused and occluded veins can be visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Micro-CT is feasible for analysis and differentiation of perfusion territories in an animal model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
