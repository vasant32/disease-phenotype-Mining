<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case report, the rare complication of sigmoid and transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after implant placement in the mastoid is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old man with congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the right ear was treated with an implant-based auricular prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the three implants in the mastoid area had to be removed because of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, whereas the other two implants were removed at the patient's request </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four days after implant removal, he was seen with sigmoid and transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and successfully treated with fibrinolytic and consecutive anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
