<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency is a disorder of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of an 18-year-old man who presented with spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep cerebral veins and straight dural sinus as the initial presentation of a previously undiagnosed AT III deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient was managed using direct endovascular infusion of the fibrinolytic agent urokinase followed by intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technique was successful in establishing patency of the deep cerebral venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient experienced a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Direct endovascular thrombolysis is a potentially effective management strategy for isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep cerebral venous system </plain></SENT>
