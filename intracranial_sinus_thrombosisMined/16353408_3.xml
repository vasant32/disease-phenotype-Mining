<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation of otogenic dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>) as a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> (AOM) can be masked by antibiotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morning episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> and a history of AOM seem to be indicative of otogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore advocate that the MRI scans of patients with similar symptoms should be carefully studied to facilitate the early diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency, pathognomonic signs, clinical course and outcome of otogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> as complications of AOM in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric patients (age 1-14 years) treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> and its complications at an academic medical center between 1999 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were otologic and ophthalmologic findings and CT and MRI scans at the beginning of treatment and 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report on five cases with otogenic <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> following AOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one of them presented initially with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> caused by otogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four cases the otologic complaints had already disappeared by the time of MRI confirmation of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one child was referred with severe otologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Management included systemic antibiotics, short-term <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation and surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our cases, even after intensive i.v. antibiotic treatment, only surgery led to a significant improvement in the clinical condition </plain></SENT>
