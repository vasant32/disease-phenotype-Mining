<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors describe two cases of cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0555970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nose infection</z:e> that quickly spread and extended to the orbital venous complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At first glance, the clinical presentation could be mistaken for a complicated sinusal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>; therefore, the evaluation of the sinuses, by means of physical examination and radiological investigation, was of great concern, showing that there was no important pathology in the sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CT scan and the color Doppler imaging (orbital ultrasound with Doppler) demonstrated, throughout the development of the disease, that the superior ophthalmic vein was affected in both patients and the cavernous sinus in one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On physical examination, chemosis of the conjunctiva, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100540'>edema of the eyelids</z:hpo> were prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients improved only after appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy against staphylococcus (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3745">clindamycin</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, making one conclude that treatment of this disease should be initiated as soon as possible in order to decrease morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
