<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> include the presence of arachnoid granulations, intrasinus fibrotic bands (so-called septa), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the appearance, distribution, and prevalence of arachnoid granulations and septa in the dural sinuses by using a high resolution 3D contrast-enhanced magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) imaging sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images and contrast-enhanced MPRAGE images of 100 consecutive patients who had no abnormalities of the dural sinuses were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence, site, number, size, signal intensity, and shape of arachnoid granulations and septa within the sinuses and their relationship with adjacent veins were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With 3D contrast-enhanced MPRAGE imaging, 433 round, oval, or lobulated focal filling defects were found in a total of 90 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Curvilinear septa were observed in 92 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients had round, oval, or lobulated defects in the transverse sinus, 59 had such defects in the superior sagittal sinus, and 47 had such defects in the straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except two of the above defects were isointense relative to CSF on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These structures were presumed to be arachnoid granulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 431 arachnoid granulations, 233 (53.8%) were located in the superior sagittal sinus, 122 (28.1%) in the transverse sinus, and 76 (17.6%) in the straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One or more veins were seen to enter arachnoid granulations in 414 (96%) instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The contrast-enhanced 3D MPRAGE imaging sequence showed a much higher prevalence and a different distribution of arachnoid granulations and septa within dural sinuses than have been observed in previous radiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Arachnoid granulations were closely related spatially to veins </plain></SENT>
