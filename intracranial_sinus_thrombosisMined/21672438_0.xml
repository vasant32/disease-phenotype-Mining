<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral Venous Thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease, accounting for about 0.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is believed to be an underdiagnosed condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion and appropriate use of imaging modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Imagiological and clinical characterization of CVT cases diagnosed at our hospital from 2004 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis from 2004 to 2007, using our institution database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reviewed hospital discharge data to assess the incidence of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retrospective review of the clinical data and imaging studies of these patients was then performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 49 patients with confirmed CVT, 38 were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient age varied between 16 and 75 years, with an average of 42.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic risk factors were found in 43 patients; the most frequent was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (n = 22) followed by oral contraceptive use (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Initial head Computerized Tomography (CT) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by Magnetic Resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) in 38 cases, Cerebral CT-Venography in 10 cases and Digital Subtraction Angiography in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Average time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to diagnosis was nine days; this was not significantly different when comparing the group diagnosed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> with the group diagnosed by CT-Venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Right transverse sinus was the most frequent location of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only in four cases <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> did not involve the lateral sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a frequent variety of CVT, accounting for 91.8% of our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A negative Head CT scan does not exclude the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>; therefore appropriate imaging study should be performed whenever there's a high degree of clinical suspicion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Cerebral CT-Venography seems to be a good alternative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> for the diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
