<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the value of unenhanced brain computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unenhanced brain CT images of 26 patients with proven CVST were mixed with 26 age and sex-matched images from patients without CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four readers reviewed the 52 brain CT images and were asked to score the examinations for the absence or presence of CVST on a scale from 0 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean density in the different venous sinuses was measured by one radiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity of unenhanced brain CT for the diagnosis of CVST was 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no false-positive readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on these data resulted in an area under the curve of 0.86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Density measurements proved to be helpful, but could not detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unenhanced brain CT is a valid initial radiological examination in the diagnosis of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the absence of false-positives in the present series, unenhanced CT can be used to decide whether further imaging with CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography is required </plain></SENT>
