<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been reported as a postoperative complication following suboccipital, transpetrosal, and transcallosal approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report on a 67-year-old man with two prior episodes of lower-extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> who underwent transcallosal resection of a colloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> and in whom sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> developed 2 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of a subsequent hematological workup revealed both a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, two thrombophilic risk factors that likely contributed to the development of delayed postoperative sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the safety of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) after craniotomy has not been established in a randomized, controlled study, there is sufficient evidence to justify its use for prophylactic anticoagulation therapy in patients at high risk for postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors propose using LMWH prophylaxis in patients with thrombophilic disorders who undergo neurosurgical procedures in proximity to dural sinuses in an effort to prevent catastrophic venous infarction </plain></SENT>
