<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY PERIOD: June 2002- May 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> new patients undergoing cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging were included in this study which consisted of 1676 consecutive subjects with 1780 examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were reviewed in real time on monitors (as they were being performed) for evidence of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> before printing of hard copies prior to disposition of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT studies were performed on Toshiba Auklet scanner with 5 mm thick axial slices and 1 cm inter slice gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed on 1.5 Tesla Toshiba Visart scanner with T1 and T2 weighted (T1 and T2W), spin echo, FLAIR and post contrast T1 weighted (T1W) imaging in multiple planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with inconclusive but suspicious conventional imaging (CT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) were evaluated by magnetic resonance venography (MRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting for follow-up of established diagnoses including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, hypertensive parenchymal haemorrhages and postsurgical status were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Delta and empty delta were the most commonly observed CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signs diagnostic of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> on pre and postcontrast images and were present in 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> was also directly visible within lumen of superior sagittal, transverse and sigmoid sinuses on T1W <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in 21 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients, these signs were either absent or too subtle to be conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, presence of venous haemorrhagic or non-haemorrhagic brain parenchymal edematous lesions prompted further evaluation by MRV, which confirmed presence of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> in these subjects as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As a result, a total of 55 patients with a frequency of 3.3% were diagnosed and treated for <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Frequency of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> in patients with neurological complaints and symptoms is 3.3%, which is significantly higher than has been clinically suspected or recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On routine CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies, diagnostic imaging signs, while highly specific for <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>, can be absent or may be masked due to technical factors or associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Presence of brain parenchymal venous haemorrhagic or non-haemorrhagic edematous lesions should prompt judicious and close scrutiny of images on monitors by changing viewing parameters to detect subtle signs of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>If still in doubt, MRV must be pursued for definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
