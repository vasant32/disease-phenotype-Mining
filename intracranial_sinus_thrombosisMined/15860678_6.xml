<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This investigation had investigational review board approval and was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant; parental informed consent was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients (20 boys, 17 girls) who ranged in age from 4 days to 15 years underwent 2D and 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two pediatric neuroradiologists compared the visibility of the superior sagittal, straight, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses and the internal jugular veins on images obtained with the two sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 17 (46%) of the 37 patients, the sequences were equivalent in terms of their depiction of venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 19 (51%) of the 37 patients, 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography was superior to 2D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suboptimal enhancement of veins occurred in one (3%) patient at 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous anomalies suggested at 2D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography but not present at 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography included flow gaps in the nondominant transverse sinuses of four patients, unilateral transverse sinus atresia in eight, and a narrowed superior sagittal sinus in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography results failed to reveal a persistent falcine sinus associated with straight sinus atresia in one patient and suggested transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in two patients in whom 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography results were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the extent of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was overestimated at 2D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As compared with 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography, 2D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography failed to reveal sigmoid sinus stenosis in one patient and poorly depicted posterior fossa dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in two patients with dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography is often superior to 2D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in the delineation of major cerebral venous structures in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most of the artifactual loss of vascular signal seen with the use of 2D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography occurred in nondominant transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
