<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The picture and bacteriology of LST have changed with the advent of antibiotics as has the usefulness of various diagnostic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less is it a disease of children in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More often it is seen in the adult patient after a long history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> and mastoid and neck tenderness are still universal signs of the affliction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, rarely patients do present with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>emaciation</z:mp> and evidence of septic emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since antibiotics are commonly used during the prodromal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear infection</z:e>, cultures are often negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If they do identify an organism, it is usually a mixed flora rather than beta hemolytic streptococcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spinal fluid results are variable and seldom is there evidence of increased spinal fluid pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arteriography, venography, and digital subtraction venography are the most reliable tests to prove and delimit the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early management involves high dose broad spectrum, intravenous antibiotics including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention involves a mastoidectomy, exposure of the sinus, incision and drainage, but not necessarily removal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Internal jugular vein ligation should be reserved for those cases in which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> and embolization do not respond to initial surgery and intravenous antibiotics </plain></SENT>
