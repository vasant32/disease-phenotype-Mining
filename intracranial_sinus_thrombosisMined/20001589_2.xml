<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The object of this study was to propose an alternative procedure to the classic decompressive hemicraniectomy using an "in-window" craniotomy and a "bridgelike" duraplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a large, almost rectangular craniotomy involving the frontal, temporal, and parietal bones and part of the occipital squama in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dura mater is opened and its area is enlarged using a rectangular dural patch of the surgeon's choice in the form of a bridge between the anterior and posterior dural edges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a vertical cut, the bone flap is divided into 2 similarly sized pieces that function as "window lids." The outer frontal and occipital sides of the bone are tied to the skull border at 2 points to function as a hinge joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angle of the bone cut must be beveled outward (inclination ~ 45Â° of the bone drill or saw) to allow the bone flap to rest on the adjacent skull and prevent its slippage toward the intracranial cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The above procedures were performed with effective control of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> due to cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, brain trauma, intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, or malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive surgery, which uses an in-window craniotomy that gradually opens according to the intracranial pressure, is an alternative solution for deploying autologous material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The procedure has the advantage of obviating the need for a second surgical procedure to close the bone defect, and thus preventing the metabolic cerebral impairment associated with the absence of an overlying skull </plain></SENT>
