<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effect of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to determine the safety and feasibility of subcutaneous LMWH, with particular attention to hemorrhagic conversions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LMWH (nadroparin, 7,500 ICU, every 12 hours) was administered subcutaneously for 14 days to 12 patients diagnosed with CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial clinical manifestations, etiologies and the clinical courses after LMWH treatment were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible hemorrhagic side effects, including aggravation of the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and/or newly developed-hemorrhagic conversions were monitored by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> movements were frequent presenting symptoms for CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement was usually observed within 2 to 8 days after LMWH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptom stabilization was observed within 4 to 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither clinical aggravations, nor newly developed parenchymal lesions were observed during LMWH maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associated parenchymal lesions were observed in 9 of the 12 patients, 5 of which manifested with hemorrhagic conversion, as detected by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no clinical and radiologic aggravation was noted in these 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that LMWH may be safe and feasible in the management of CVT </plain></SENT>
