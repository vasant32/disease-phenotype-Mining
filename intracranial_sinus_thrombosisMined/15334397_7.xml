<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (LST) is a rare but potentially devastating complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review the clinical presentation, evaluation, management, operative findings, and outcomes of this serious complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed at a teaching hospital of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with an otogenic lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> between 1992 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on patients with otogenic LST were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified with a diagnosis of lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, otalgia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiologic evaluation included computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or magnetic resonance venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had radiographic evidence of LST preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The thrombosed sinus was on the right side in 6 patients and on the left side in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (8 of 11) had a second concomitant intracranial complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was removal in 7 cases, whereas only needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of the sinus was performed in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> bacilli and anaerobes were the most common organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> but sequelae included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VI nerve palsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, and dead ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LST as a complication of otogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> may still pose a serious threat that warrants immediate attention and care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is frequently associated with other intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging plays a major role in determining diagnosis and treatment plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The availability of broad-spectrum antibiotics has improved our management significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Conservative surgical intervention including eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> perisinus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of the sinus seems to be effective </plain></SENT>
