<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients selective arterial angiography was also performed and 5 patients were followed up by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography after an interval of three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MRT images and individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography images were analysed and 3-D reconstruction performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography correctly demonstrated venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; the most frequently affected were the superior sagittal sinus, the ascending cerebral veins and the transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with DSA, magnetic resonance angiography achieved a high degree of accuracy in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was significantly better in evaluating the basal sinus system whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of individual ascending veins was better shown by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, primary use of MRT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography is recommended for the diagnosis of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
