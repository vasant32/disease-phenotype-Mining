<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, since 1982, Hasso et al demonstrated with CT the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adipose tissue in the cavernous sinus, the mere existence of fat in the cranium does not necessarily mean the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">fatty tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The author first described fat deposition in the superior sagittal sinus and torcular Herophili following a CT study performed in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution, frequency, and anatomical correlations of fat in the dural sinus as demonstrated on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fat was detected in the cavernous sinus in 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (492/2408), and occurred more frequently (25%) in those older than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fat was less frequent in the other dural sinuses (3%; 75/2296) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common location was the torcular Herophili, followed in decreasing order of frequency by the straight sinus, inferior sagittal sinus, superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination was performed in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fat deposition was composed of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adipose tissue and was devoid of fibrous encapsulation or infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case, the fat seemed to be partly exposed to the subarachnoid space on CT, whereas on autopsy, thin dura mater covering the fat nodule was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fat in the dural sinus must be differentiated from cavernous nodule or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Hounsfield unit may be helpful in making a definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
