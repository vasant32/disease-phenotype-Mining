<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the clinical features and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> in children referred to the ENT/Audiology Department of the University of Ferrara from January 1994 to December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It also aims to discuss risk factors and to find predictors for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study on case sheets of children with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> diagnosis was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria: they presented otoscopical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> and inflammatory findings of the mastoid area such as post-auricular swelling, redness or tenderness, protrusion of the auricle and/or radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were only treated with antibiotic therapy, tympanocentesis alone was performed in 11 cases; in 5, a ventilation tube was positioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy was performed in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group who underwent mastoidectomy had a median hospital stay of 15 days (5-54), in this group were found the following complications: 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, 1 meningo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, 1 lateral and sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the incidence of otomastoiditis does not seem to be decreasing, on the contrary, in some countries, it seems to be on the increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our experience cannot confirm a real increase of the incidence but we noted periodic variations during the time of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important, that careful attention is paid to the clinical assessment of children who are 2-years old or under, as they seem to be more exposed to the risk of clinical complications; therefore, it is highly recommended that the otologist and the paediatrician collaborate closely </plain></SENT>
