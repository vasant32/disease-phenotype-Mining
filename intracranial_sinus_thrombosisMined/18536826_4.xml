<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to review the clinical, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis and the frequency of positive neuroimaging findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) involving the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinical and radiological database of patients with final diagnosis of CVT was compiled from the inpatient hospital information service of a tertiary neurological hospital over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT and MRI studies in 22 patients were retrospectively examined for direct signs of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and for complications of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CVT before and after CT and MRI was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical diagnosis of possible CVT was suspected in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the diagnosis was not suspected, CT diagnosis was difficult and there was a high false negative rate of 52.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI fared better, but the false negative rate was still 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Directs signs of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> such as the triangle sign, empty delta sign on CT and loss of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow voids on MRI, could be retrospectively detected in 57.9%, 100% and 100% of patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although 4 patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, these direct signs were present in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical diagnosis of CVT is rarely suspected before CT and MRI, and although subtle positive signs are often present, these may not be appreciated unless there is a high index of suspicion or image review at multidisciplinary team meetings </plain></SENT>
