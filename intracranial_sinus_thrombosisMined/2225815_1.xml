<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four patients <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi> was administered, following a noncontrast scan </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">Gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi> shortened the scan time, displaying small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> as well as sagittal sinus involvement to advantage </plain></SENT>
