<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty seven (70.16%) were women and 37 (29.83%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical manifestations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty seven (65.51%) women took oral contraceptive pills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty of 57 women (35.08%) took the pill longer than one month to be able to fast in Ramadan or perform the Hajj ceremonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the mean time they developed cerebral venous-sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Superior sagital sinus, with or without lateral sinuses, was the most involved area (70.96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High mortality and morbidity rates (14.51% and 35.48%, respectively) were found in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor prognostic factors at the time of admission were stupor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (P=0.001) and evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in primary CT scan (P=0.005).Conclusion: Taking oral contraceptive pills was a main factor associated with cerebral venous-sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations, prognostic factors, common involved sinuses and image findings of this study were similar to those of other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Health care policy makers should design a plan to warn susceptible women of the risk of cerebral venous-sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and to educate them the ways to prevent it </plain></SENT>
