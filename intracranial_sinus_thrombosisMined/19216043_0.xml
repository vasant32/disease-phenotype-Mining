<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-one consecutive pediatric patients (age range 5-16 years) with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase during a 10-year period, were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3 cases were studied by computed tomography (CT) without MRI, and 15 underwent both CT and MRI studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases, intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) was performed after non-invasive preliminary assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen hemorrhagic (41%) and 24 ischemic (59%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among hemorrhagic forms, 5 cases were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>), 7 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e>, and 2 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among ischemic forms, 2 were due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle-cell disease</z:e>, 1 to hyperomocysteinemia, 1 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, 1 to pseudoxantoma elasticum, 3 to prothrombotic state, 1 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry's disease</z:e>, 1 concomitant with CO intoxication, 5 to venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 4 to cardio-embolic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Etiology remains unknown in 8 cases (20.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows a moderate prevalence of ischemic over hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, personal experience suggests that MRI is always more informative than CT and in selected cases should be the first-choice examination in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
