<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (dAVF) of the transverse and sigmoid sinus which developed over five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 64-year-old man, who had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No abnormal lesions were detected in the cerebral angiograms five years prior to the time the etiology of his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He suddenly suffered from left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and the CT scan showed right parietal subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right carotid angiogram demonstrated dAVF of the transverse and sigmoid sinus supplied by the right occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We thought the reason for the subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in this patient was due to the disturbance of venous return in the right cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We underwent direct embolization of the right transverse sinus by interlocking detachable coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cerebral angiograms demonstrated the disappearance of dAVF and he was discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether dAVF is a congenital anomaly or not, has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the dAVF in this case had newly developed over five years, it is suggested that dAVF is an acquired lesion </plain></SENT>
