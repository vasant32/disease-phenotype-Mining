<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neonates and children increasingly receive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (ACT) based on adult studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Safety data for ACT in pediatric CSVT are scant and urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective was to assess the safety and outcome of ACT in pediatric CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a single-center prospective study, neonates and children with CSVT received ACT (standard/low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) by standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A study neuroradiologist (M.S.) assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> initial and follow-up neuroimaging for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> propagation, and recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed with the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Outcome Measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 162 pediatric patients, 85 received ACT at diagnosis, including 29/83 (35%) neonates and 56/79 (71%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in 6% (6/99) of treated patients, including 14% (3/21 neonates, 2/15 children) with and 2% (0/17 neonates, 1/46 children) without pretreatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ACT-associated bleeds were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonfatal, and clinical outcome was favorable in 50%, similar to the remaining patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early follow-up imaging demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> propagation in 11/57 neonates (10/35 [28%] without and 1/22 [4%] with ACT [p = 0.037]) and 10/63 children (7/19 [37%] without and 3/44 [7%] with ACT [p = 0.006]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Propagation was associated with new venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 10% neonates and 40% children and worse clinical outcome in children (p = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recanalization occurred earlier and more completely in neonates (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was unfavorable in 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In pediatric CSVT, ACT appears safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nontreatment with ACT is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> propagation, observed in (1/4) of untreated neonates and over (1/3) of children </plain></SENT>
