<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate if <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increases in intracranial pressure were accompanied by subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 17 intensive care patients (11 male, aged 3-66 yr) who were selected from 85 patients requiring intracranial pressure measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected to have a 30 min, 16-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded when intracranial pressure remained increased despite preliminary treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnoses included head injury, intracranial haemorrhage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial pressure increase</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pressures ranged from 90 to 440 mm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Encephalopathic features (delta/theta rhythms and burst suppression) were noted on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude from this pilot study that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are an uncommon cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, long-term monitoring in a large cohort of intensive care patients would be necessary, studying patients with similar diagnoses and ages </plain></SENT>
