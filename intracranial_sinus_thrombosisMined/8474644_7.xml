<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the literature, clinical descriptions of sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurring after closed head injury in children are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One to 5 days after trauma to the back of the head, five children (aged 1 to 7 yr) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trauma was mild in four children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the children, performed within 5 days after the injury, showed focal hyperdensity in the region of the left sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four children had extra-axial hyperdense collections along the left transverse sinus, and three had skull fractures adjacent to the left sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the children, performed 2 to 6 days after injury, showed left sigmoid-sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and decreased flow or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> within the lateral third of the left transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the children had MRI scans 4 to 6 weeks after their diagnosis and were followed up for 1 to 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four children whose symptoms subsided completely within 2 to 10 weeks, MRI showed recanalization of the sigmoid sinus within 4 to 6 weeks after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one child whose symptoms resolved after 6 months, sigmoid-sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> persisted with the formation of collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that traumatic sigmoid-sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> should be suspected when a child has persistent or delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> after injury to the back of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography characteristically demonstrated focal hyperdensity within the sigmoid sinus that we term the dense sigmoid-sinus sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because the sinus recanalized and the symptoms subsided in most children within 6 weeks, we conclude that prophylactic medical or surgical intervention is not indicated </plain></SENT>
