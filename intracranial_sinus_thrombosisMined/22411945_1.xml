<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of these substances have physical properties that lead to other specific imaging features as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-containing lesions frequently produce chemical shift artifact, and some melanin-containing lesions exhibit a combination of high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases in which diagnostically specific T1-weighted imaging features are lacking, findings obtained with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> pulse sequences and other modalities can help narrow the differential diagnosis: An elevated glutamine or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> level at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy is suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002480'>hepatic encephalopathy</z:hpo>; a popcorn ball-like appearance at T2-weighted imaging, of cavernous malformations; and hyperattenuation at computed tomography, of mineral deposition disease </plain></SENT>
