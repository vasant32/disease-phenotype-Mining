<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective is to study the annual incidence and standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) in a cohort of Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VTE events of SLE patients occurring between 1999 and 2008 were identified from our database, and the annual incidence of VTE was calculated according to the cohort size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SIRs were estimated by the ratios of the incidence of VTE in SLE to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2008, 516 SLE patients were in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 32.2 +/- 14 years and the duration of SLE was 9.3 +/- 8.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven percent of the patients had disease duration of &gt; or =5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between 1999 and 2008, 18 episodes of VTE occurred in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of VTE did not show significant fluctuation and the mean annual incidence was 4.2/1,000 patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reported VTE events were: popliteal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (56%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (22%), renal vein, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein, subclavian vein and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (5.6% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risks of VTE since SLE diagnosis were 2.8% and 3.7% at 5 and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to the general population, the mean SIR of VTE in SLE patients within this period was 11.9 (7.31-19.6; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The SIR of VTE was highest in patients under the age of 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> was independently associated with VTE (HR 4.36 [1.67-11.4]; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is uncommon in Chinese, Chinese patients with SLE are 12 times more prone to VTE than the general population </plain></SENT>
