<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the changes in flow velocity and direction and signal intensities of sigmoid sinuses on phase-contrast (PC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images obtained with regular breathing and with deep inspiratory breath holding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seven subjects without venous sinus abnormality were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronal 2D PC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and axial 2D PC images with peripheral pulse gating were acquired with a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit, during regular breathing and deep inspiratory breath holding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The signal intensity changes of bilateral sigmoid sinuses on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms and the changes of flow velocity and direction on the axial 2D PC images were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Breath holding decreased signal intensities of the right and left sigmoid sinuses on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms in 57 (53.3%) and 36 (33.6%) subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased signal intensity was observed in 12 (11.2%) and 33 (30.8%) subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the flow analysis, retrograde flow was detected at the left sigmoid sinus in four subjects (3.7%) during regular breathing, which was normalized by breath holding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities of the right and left sigmoid sinuses decreased during breath holding in 92 (86.0%) and 70 (65.4%) subjects, and increased in 15 (14.0%) and 37 (34.6%) subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The signal intensities of sigmoid sinuses were affected by breath holding in about 2/3 of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Breath-holding maneuver can be used to increase blood flow and signal intensities of dural venous sinuses on PC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms </plain></SENT>
