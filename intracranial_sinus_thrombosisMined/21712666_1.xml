<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> associated with CVST in which <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment was associated with rebleeding, and we review current evidence of anticoagulation safety in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> associated with CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 65-year-old man presented with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain computed tomography showed a left frontoparietal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic studies with magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a partial superior saggital sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a diagnosis of CVST, intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours the patient had a symptomatic increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> size, and 2 days later the patient developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> with new evidence of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment was stopped and the patient experienced neurological improvement, with no new episodes of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence for the safety of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in CVST comes from 2 small trials involving a total of 79 patients, but only 18 had some degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in baseline computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis suggested that in CVST patients who are treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> is low, but acknowledged that an impact of up to 9% of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> cannot be ruled out </plain></SENT>
