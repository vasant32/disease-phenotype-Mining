<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the risk factors, clinical profile, and outcome of the fully investigated cases of CSVT from a major university referral hospital in South India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients of CSVT confirmed by definite neuroimaging criteria and fully investigated for prothrombotic states, between June 2002 and September 2010, were prospectively studied in the Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry of Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, South India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 428 patients, 230 (53.7%) were men and the mean age was 31.3 years (range 8-65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were noted in 126 (29.4%) patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> like presentation was found in 122 (28.5%) patients, and benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> like presentation was found in 78 (18.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Common risk factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in 79 (18.4%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> in 78 (18.2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e> in 67 (15.6%), oral contraceptive pill intake in 49 (11.4%), postpartum state in 42 (9.8%), anticardiolipin antibodies in 31 (7.2%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> in 53 (12.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale Â£ 2) was observed in 273 (71.2%) of 383 patients available for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-house mortality was noted in 33 (7.7%) and recurrence in 22 (5.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the previous studies, prevalence of CSVT was higher in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e>, oral contraceptive use, and postpartum state were the most common risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall prognosis was good, but a small percentage of patients died or showed recurrence </plain></SENT>
