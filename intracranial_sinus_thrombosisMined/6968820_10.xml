<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had enlargement of the ventricular system, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six had elevated CSF pressure (mean, 30 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At least two mechanisms sufficient to prevent ventricular enlargement and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> are suggested by these cases: 1) intracranial pressure elevations that occur as a result of cerebral venous outflow impediment maintain a positive pressure gradient between the intracranial CSF and the sagittal sinus contents, thereby increasing bulk CSF outflow; 2) in adults, increased function of alternative CSF outflow pathways occurs secondary to sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> across the arachnoid villi of other intracranial vascular structures and in the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms may have general importance in the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by other <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> in adults but not in children </plain></SENT>
