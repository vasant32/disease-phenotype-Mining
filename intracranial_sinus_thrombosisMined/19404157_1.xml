<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty rats were assigned to 4 groups: group A (n = 35), the venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group; group B (n = 35), the venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> group; group C (n = 25), the sham operation group; and group D (n = 25), the sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure, sinus pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and regional cerebral blood flow were monitored during the operation and 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological and Western blot analyses of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were performed, and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In groups A and B, a decreased cerebral perfusion pressure from 98.25 +/- 5.83 to 69.35 +/- 6.87 mm Hg and from 99.32 +/- 4.19 to 64.79 +/- 6.71 mm Hg was detected, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, the cerebral blood flow obviously decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the right occipital lobe only, the hypoperfusion state lasted for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological staining of vascular endothelial growth factor was persistently positive in the right occipital lobe, arachnoid membrane, and nearby dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the dura mater was prominent 12 weeks after the operation in groups A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blotting showed high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in the dura mater in groups A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> local hypoperfusion secondary to intracranial sinus high pressure seemed to be the main cause of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the dura mater, leading to the formation of intracranial dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
