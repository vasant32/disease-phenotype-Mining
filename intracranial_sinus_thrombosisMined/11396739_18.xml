<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HRBV provides unique high-resolution information on veins without administration of contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data are independent of conventional findings on MRI and potentially useful in characterising and demonstrating the architecture of vascular lesions of the brain </plain></SENT>
