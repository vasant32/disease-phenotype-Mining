<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among Turkish cohorts, 5-15% of patients show involvement of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) at some time during their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are mainly two types of clinical presentation: parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>CNS inflammation</z:mp> manifesting mainly as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> of the brainstem, or dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several drugs like high-dose steroids or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, mainly <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, are used in the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients who do not respond sufficiently to these agents or are not able tolerate them, other options are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We are presenting 4 cases with parenchymal neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, where commonly used immunosuppressive drugs could not be continued due to intolerance or inefficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the patients benefited well from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The benefit was sustained during 3-7 years of follow-up (median 6.5 years) </plain></SENT>
