<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is recognized that absorption of C.S.F. occurs mainly at the superior sagittal sinus through arachnoid villi after study of the Retzius (1875) and Weed (1914) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are interested in C.S.F. circulation and pathway on the obstructed superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the border of middle one third and posterior one third of the superior sagittal sinus was obstructed experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When evans blue 0.5 to 1.0 ml was injected into lateral ventricle or cisterna magna, the evans blue was recognized on basal surface in either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and obstructed dog of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evans blue stained the convexity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dog, however, did not stain the convexity in the dog of obstructed superior sagittal sinus contrally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was caused by the disturbance of C.S.F. circulation toward superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the intraventricular injection of evans blue, it infiltrated into parenchym from ventripcle due to C.S.F. circulatory disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Study of radioactivity in the peripheral blood after intracisternal or intraventricular injection of RISA 100 muCi revealed that the radioactivity in the blood lowered with day after obstruction of superior sagittal sinus comparing with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Macroautoradiography after intracisternal or intraventricular injection of P 2mCi showed lower RI activity at the convexity, but increased activity at the basal brain in the obstructed dogs of superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results showed that C.S.F. in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dog was absorbed through the brain surface, expecially the basal surface of brain, other than through the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Absorption of C.S.F. through the convexity of brain was disturbed significantly in the obstructed dogs of superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>C.S.F. absorption into peripheral blood decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage after occlusion of surperior sagittal sinus and it suggested that the absorptive function of C.S.F. through the basal surface of brain was restricted </plain></SENT>
