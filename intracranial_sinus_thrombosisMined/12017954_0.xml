<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The autopsies of maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1980-1999) from the Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Médico del Noreste, IMSS in Monterrey, México, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases were classified in directly obstetric maternal mortality (DOM) and indirectly obstetric maternal mortality (IOM), the causes were studied and the percent of concordance between pre- and post-mortem diagnosis was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 124 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autopsy was performed in 61 (49.1%) women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 55 cases the clinical file and the autopsy protocol were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was our sample for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of the cases were DO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Causes of DOM were: specific hypertensive pregnancy disease (SHPD) (51.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (35.5%), hypovolemic shock (9.7%), <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> accidents (3%); causes of IOM were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (41.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (16.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> (12.5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> and systemic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (12.5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disorders</z:e> (12.5%), and Superior Longitudinal Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 100% clinical-pathological concordance was observed in DOM cases, while only a 41.6% was found in IOM cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In those cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (IOM), the etiologic agents were identified only in 20% before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early detection and treatment of SHPD and the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> should decrease the MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study showed some <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the Health Services that should be improved </plain></SENT>
