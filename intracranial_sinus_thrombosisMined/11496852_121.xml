<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in children is a serious disorder, and information is needed about its prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Canadian Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic Stroke</z:hpo> Registry was initiated in 1992 at the 16 pediatric tertiary care centers in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children (newborn to 18 years of age) with symptoms and radiographic confirmation of sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first six years of the registry, 160 consecutive children with sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were enrolled, and the incidence of the disorder was 0.67 cases per 100,000 children per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neonates were most commonly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight percent of the children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 76 percent had diffuse neurologic signs, and 42 percent had focal neurologic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk factors included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333941" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">head and neck disorders</z:e> (in 29 percent), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> systemic illnesses (in 54 percent), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> (in 36 percent), and prothrombotic states (in 41 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred in 41 percent of the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three percent of the children received antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficits were present in 38 percent of the children, and 8 percent died; half the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors of adverse neurologic outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at presentation and venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in children affects primarily neonates and results in neurologic impairment or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in approximately half the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> portends a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
