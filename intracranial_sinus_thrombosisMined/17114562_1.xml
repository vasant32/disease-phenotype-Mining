<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients who were clinically suspected of having cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, irrespective of age and sex, underwent cerebral CT venography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Projection venograms were displayed using maximum-intensity-projection images for both CT venography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CT venograms were also displayed using the integral algorithm, which depicts the average intensity value of the first five voxels deep in relation to the model surface that is nearest the viewer, allowing direct visualization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CT venograms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms were independently evaluated by experienced neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of these 50 patients, 30 patients were diagnosed as having cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on both CT venography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total numbers of sinuses involved were 81 and 77 (CT venography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography was used as the gold standard, CT venography was found to have both a sensitivity and a specificity of 75-100%, depending on the sinus and vein involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT venography is as accurate as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography for diagnosing cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
