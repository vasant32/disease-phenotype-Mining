<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the orbital structures can affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups, but is more frequent in pediatric populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prompt recognition, correct diagnosis, and adequate management are important if serious complications are to be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to delineate the clinical, bacteriological and radiological findings, management and outcome of orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 80 children admitted to Chang Gung Children's Hospital with a diagnosis of orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> who were staged by computed tomography (CT), between January 1999 and August 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staging classification was as follows: stage I, inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (preseptal); stage II, subperiosteal phlegmon and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>; stage III, orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>; stage IV, orbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>; and stage V, ophthalmic vein and cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were categorized into 2 groups: preseptal (stage I) and postseptal (stage II-V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 80 children, 50 were male and the mean age was 6.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>Sinusitis</z:hpo> and upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> were the most common predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty one percent of patients in stage I presented with symptoms that indicated postseptal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with postseptal involvement had a significantly higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo> and limitation of extraocular motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> pathogens were identified in 31 patients (39%), the 2 most common pathogens being Staphylococcus and Streptococcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (13%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymicrobial infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty three patients underwent sinus and/or orbital and/or intracranial surgery, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients (100%) in stage IV, 3 of 6 patients (50%) in stage III, 13 of 35 patients (37%) in stage II, and 2 of 34 patients (6%) in stage I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complete resolution without complication was achieved in 72 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had complications, including intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 3, recollection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> in 2, and corneal scar in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>Proptosis</z:hpo> and limitation of extraocular motility may be considered the most important signs on CT examination in children with suspicious orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Given that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymicrobial infection</z:e> is common, broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Surgery should be considered not only when an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> is demonstrated by CT scan but also if clinical deterioration occurs within 24 to 36 h of adequate intravenous antibiotic treatment </plain></SENT>
