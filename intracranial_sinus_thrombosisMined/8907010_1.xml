<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography at the initial operation for massive intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the parietal lobe showed no vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography 3 years later revealed a mixed dural-pial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> at the previous surgical site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, the venous drainage from the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was not into the patent superior sagittal sinus, but was retrograde into the contralateral cortical veins in the occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No skull fracture or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was resected successfully without neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pial portion of the lesion may have been a congenital anomaly, and the dural portion acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of a dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> at an earlier surgical site is uncommon, and may indicate the possible pathogenesis of acquired dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> unrelated to sinus occlusion or accidental trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there are various possible patterns of venous drainage in vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
