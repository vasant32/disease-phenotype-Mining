<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe the neuroradiologic findings in hemorrhagic venous infarction related to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on two patients with superior sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> related to the presence of aPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A parenchymal region of hyperintense signal due to hemorrhagic venous infarction was demonstrated in both patients, along with abnormal signal within the thrombosed superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemorrhagic venous infarction may result from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> related to aPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of these antibodies should be considered in the setting of otherwise unexplained dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or venous infarction </plain></SENT>
