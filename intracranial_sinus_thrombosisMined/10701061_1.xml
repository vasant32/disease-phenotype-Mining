<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Two cases of heterozygous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> are reported in neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severe neurologic distress was associated with bloody cerebrospinal fluid, and hemorrhagic lesions due to cerebral sinovenous occlusion were visualised by cerebral imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The course was severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0011507'>renal thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation in the 168 proline/leucine was detected by molecular biology in the neonates and their mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case a treatment with protein C had no beneficial effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> has to be sought by magnetic resonance imaging in the case of neurologic distress with profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the newborn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A low level of protein C has to be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of a heterozygous deficiency status can only be made through molecular biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of treatment with protein C concentrate is questionable </plain></SENT>
