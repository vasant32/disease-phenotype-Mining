<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Endovascular thrombolysis, with or without mechanical clot removal, may be beneficial for a subgroup of patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVT) who have a poor prognosis despite treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published experience with endovascular thrombolysis is promising but only based on case series and not on controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The objective of the Thrombolysis or Anticoagulation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral Venous Thrombosis</z:hpo> (TO-ACT) trial is to determine if endovascular thrombolysis improves the functional outcome of patients with a severe form of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The TO-A C T trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients are eligible if they have a radiologically proven CVT, a high probability of poor outcome (defined by presence of one or more of the following risk factors: mental status disorder, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, intracranial hemorrhagic lesion, or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep cerebral venous system), and if the responsible physician is uncertain if endovascular thrombolysis or standard <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment is better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-four patients (82 in each treatment arm) will be included to detect a 50% relative reduction (from 40% to 20%) of poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STUDY: Patients will be randomized to receive either endovascular thrombolysis or standard therapy (therapeutic doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endovascular thrombolysis is composed of local application of rt-plasminogen activator (PA) or urokinase within the thrombosed sinuses, mechanical thrombosuction, or a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients randomized to endovascular thrombolysis will be treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> before and after the interventional procedure, according to international guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the modified Rankin score (mRS) at 12 months, with a score â‰¥2 defined as poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes are six-months mRS, mortality, and recanalization rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major intracranial and extracranial hemorrhagic complications within one-week after the intervention are the principal safety outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results will be analyzed according to the 'intention-to-treat' principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Blinded assessors not involved in the treatment of the patient will assess endpoints with standardized questionnaires </plain></SENT>
