<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IH) mimicking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (i.e., idiopathic IH) has been reported in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) since the 1960s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although various mechanisms have been proposed (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, medication side effect, and immunologic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>) none have been proven to be causal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients with IH and SLE at a single tertiary care institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a cohort of IIH patients the percentage of patients in our study with SLE was 1% (4 in 410) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three out of the four patients had serologic evidence for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> but only one had cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or worsening of IH in close temporal relationship to steroid withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The course, treatment, and prognosis of our patients with SLE and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> did not differ significantly from our clinical experience with IIH or with the published natural history data for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association of SLE and IH may occur more than by chance alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Steroid withdrawal in the treatment of the SLE may be a predisposing or precipitating factor in the development of IH in these patients rather than the inflammatory effects of SLE per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> in some patients with SLE may also produce cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as an additional potential mechanism of IH </plain></SENT>
