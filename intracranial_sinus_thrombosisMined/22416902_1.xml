<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this RCT, we have evaluated the efficacy and safety of LMWH versus UFH in CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   Consecutive patients with CVST diagnosed on the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography (MRV) who was free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding diathesis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, hepatic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>History, clinical findings and risk factors were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI and MRV findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomized to LMWH and UFH groups for 14 days followed by oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality and 3 months outcome as assessed by Barthel index (BI) score were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   32 patients received UFH and 34 received LMWH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The baseline demographic, clinical and radiological parameters were similar in both the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients died and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were in UFH group (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, insignificantly higher number of patients recovered completely in LMWH compared to UFH group (30 vs. 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no serious side effect needing withdrawal of drugs except one was withdrawn from UFH because of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   Low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resulted in significantly lower hospital mortality in CVST compared to UFH </plain></SENT>
