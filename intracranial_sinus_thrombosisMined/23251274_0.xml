<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was conducted of the clinical and imaging data of 62 patients with CVST diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 62 cases, MRI (1.5 T MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) examinations were conducted for 56 cases, and 54 of these were definitely diagnosed as CVST cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their MRI manifestations presented punctiform and sheet-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cerebral infarction</z:e> and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> while partial cases presented cerebral ventricle dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, MRI, MRV and DSA examinations were conducted synchronously for 2l cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 20 patients whose MRI and MRV examinations were positive, 19 cases were positive by DSA examination and the coincidence rate of the two was 95.00% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of CVST lack specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI combined with MRV examination is the preferred method of diagnosing CVST </plain></SENT>
