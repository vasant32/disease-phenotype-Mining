<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 21 year-old female presented to our institution in a rapidly deteriorating neurological state following failed systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy for treatment of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient underwent emergent mechanical thrombectomy of the thrombosed SSS using the 0.054-inch Penumbra catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No adjuvant direct pharmacologic and/or mechanical thrombectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful venous recanalization was achieved using the Penumbra system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient improved symptomatically following the intervention, and she made a complete neurological recovery within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 6-month follow-up, the patient had returned to work and school and remained neurologically intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A repeat MRV showed complete sinus recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Direct mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra system provided rapid sinus recanalization for the treatment of symptomatic cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This device is a valuable addition to the neurointerventional armamentarium </plain></SENT>
