<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the efficacy and complications of local thrombolysis using urokinase in cases of cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> unresponsive to conventional <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with clinical and radiologic diagnosis of cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were taken for local thrombolysis using femoral vein approach if they did not respond to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy after 5 days of administration of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urokinase was used as the thrombolytic agent and dose was decided depending on the recanalization obtained during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 3 patients treated, two had complete recanalization and one had partial recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two had dramatic recovery of the clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient in whom thrombolysis was delayed had partial recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None had any complications related to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Local thrombolytic therapy is effective in recanalization of thrombosed sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is worth considering in dire circumstances especially when a patient fails to respond to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, randomized controlled trials are necessary before any firm recommendations can be made as to whether it can be used as a primary modality of treatment in cases of cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
