<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective review of charts of 32 cases with intracranial complications due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle ear infection</z:e> managed between 1993 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The symptoms, clinical findings, and medical and surgical management were reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 10 (31.2%) patients in the age group of 0 to 10 years, 9 (28.1%) patients in the age group of 11 to 18 years, and 13 (40.6%) patients older than 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Males were involved twice as much as females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 32 patients, 18 (56.3%) had a single intracranial complication, whereas 14 (43.7%) had multiple intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the intracranial complications in the 32 patients, otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> was the commonest intracranial complication and was seen in 14 (43.7%) patients; it was followed by lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 10 (31.2%), cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in 6 (18.7%), epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in 7 (21.8%), and perisinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in 5 (15.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other less common but serious intracranial complications encountered were cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and interhemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in 2 (6.2%) each, and subdural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and otogenic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 1 (3.1%) each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received a combination of parenteral antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Canal wall down mastoidectomy was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, lateral sinus was explored in 13 (40.6%) and cerebellar abscesses were drained in 5 (15.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate of 31.2% was found in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prognosis was worse with delayed presentation because of overwhelming intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> due to multiple pathways of extension from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the dural venous sinus should be removed to prevent dissemination of septic emboli </plain></SENT>
