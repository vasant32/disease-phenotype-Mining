<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the two men the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> was diagnosed only after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe thromboembolic complications (cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>) during <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
