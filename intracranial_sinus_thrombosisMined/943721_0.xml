<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This presentation is a study of 18 patients diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and treated by CSF diversion procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative neurological conditions of these patients were evaluated, compared, and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 56% of males and 44% of females and the number of patients under 60 and over 61 were equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histories and clinical findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suggested a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12, the two thirds of patients, showed progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>intellectual deterioration</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar neurological features were preceded by craniocerebral trauma in one, megadolichobasilar artery in one and superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three cases were idiopathic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>169Yb cisternography, transfer test of radioisotope to blood, angiography and in some cases pneumoencephalography were performed in the usual manner to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Attempts have been made to correlate the surgical results with the ages of patients, the duration of symtoms, and the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptoms were divided into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group "A" is composed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>mental deterioration</z:hpo>, lack of spontaneity and willingness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002300'>mutism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo>, groups "B" includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> and group "C" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of surgical treatment were analyzed according to the three groups of symptoms not only in the percentage of cases who improved but also in the time interval from the time of shunting to the appearance of operative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results are as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The good surgical improvements were achieved in the cases of under 70 years old, in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> of known causes, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, craniocerebral trauma, and in the cases operated on within three months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recovery of "A" symtoms was achieved not only sooner after the operation but also in more cases than those of "B" and "C" symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The correlation was analyzed between the duration or symptoms and time interval after the shunting and the appearance of operative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although no correlation was obtained in "A" symptoms, the sooner was shunting performed, the earlier appeared the operative results in "B" and "C" symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it appeared from the results of the present study, that in addition to the integration of the results of different examinations such as isotope cisternography, air study and angiography, the combination of the patient data such as ages, duration of symptoms and the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> are essential in selecting the patients for shunting operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>If the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is confirmed and surgical improvement is predicted, the patient should be shunted as soon as possible to obtain a good surgical results especially in mental symptoms, which is the important factor in performing rehabilitation therapy </plain></SENT>
