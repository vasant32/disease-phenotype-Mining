<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been applied to a variety of different manifestations of intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presently, MRA studies and flow measurement techniques serve to compliment the more traditional spin-echo evaluation of patients with small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, arterial and venous occlusions, vascular malformations, and in some cases of neoplastic vascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Practically, the limitations of these techniques must be taken into account such that the appropriate method is applied to answer a specific clinical question and the acquisition parameters are chosen to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intent of this review is to summarize the technical approaches, clinical role, pitfalls, and potential improvements in the MRA techniques as they apply to the intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
