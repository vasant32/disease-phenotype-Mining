<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many important questions regarding pathophysiology and treatment of cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> need clarification and may depend on further knowledge on the etiology, site, extension and recanalization of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied these variables in a cohort of children and adolescents from seven Portuguese Centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conclude from our results that the deep venous system and the superior longitudinal sinus are less frequently affected with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but have a greater potential for serious neurologic disease and for major sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-recanalization, at least in the long term, is not an adverse prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extensive propagation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from the initial site of origin seems to be common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early identification of risk factors and their treatment coupled with an aggressive attitude towards diagnosis and treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> involving the deep venous system would be warranted </plain></SENT>
