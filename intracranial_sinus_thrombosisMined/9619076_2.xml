<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was also found and his symptom was attributed to venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> caused by the sinus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had received partial resection of the right trigeminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>neurinoma</z:hpo> two years before, and the operation was thought to have caused the sinus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dural AVF of the posterior fossa usually causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> seen in present case is relatively rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present case, serial study of cranial CT scan demonstrated evolution of dural AVF after sinus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> was thought to re-open the physiological micro-AVF to cause the dural AVF </plain></SENT>
