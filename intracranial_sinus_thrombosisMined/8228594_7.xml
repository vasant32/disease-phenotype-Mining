<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a six-year-period, from January 1985 to December 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath> and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. in two, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), Proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and Enterobacter sp. in two </plain></SENT>
