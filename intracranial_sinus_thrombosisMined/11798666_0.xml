<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 65 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) were proved by angiography (n = 34) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (n = 44), 30 by both procedures and 6 by pathology as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their age ranged from 13 to 59 years (mean age 32.5), 31 were male and 34 were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical manifestations were variable, but most patients had symptoms and signs of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (91%)such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of the patients had focal neurological dysfunction (49%) such as <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of limbs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and half of the patients had intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (51%) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occluded dural sinus and the clot could be visualised directly by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI and MRA are becoming the imaging investigation of choice for the diagnosis of CVT, Anticoagulation, thrombolysis and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> may be effective measures in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
