<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indications and techniques for decompressive craniectomy and intensive care regimen are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2000 and 2004 15 patients with CVT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Zurich </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, four patients with the most severe illness course were treated with decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for decompressive craniectomy were deterioration of level of consciousness with CT signs of space occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, venous infarction and congestional <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> with mass effect, midline shift and obliteration of the basal cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 15 patients with CVT and intraparenchymatous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> four patients were treated with decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) immediately before the operation was in mean 10.2 (range 6 to 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient showed signs of unilateral or bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">third nerve palsy</z:e> before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No surgical complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy recovered with favourable functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale; GOS 4 and 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was reconvened 12 hours postoperatively with half dosage and 12 hours later with full dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No enlargement of existing intraparenchymatous <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> or other <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Favorable functional outcome in selected patients with most severe courses of CVT can be achieved after decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperative anticoagulation therapy with full dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> 24 hours after craniotomy seems to be safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Precise indications and techniques for combined surgical decompression and thrombectomy deserve to be evaluated in future studies </plain></SENT>
