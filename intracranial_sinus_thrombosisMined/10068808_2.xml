<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a clinical entity which is readily diagnosed with the advent of modern imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is now a standard therapy, but more recent treatment strategies have included endovascular thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the endpoint of this intervention both clinically and radiographically has not been defined, noninvasive monitoring techniques may add further objective measures of treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a patient with a four day history of worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> on exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Superior sagittal, straight, and bilateral transverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinus thromboses</z:e> were identified on computed tomography and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Emergent endovascular thrombolysis by a transvenous approach re-established venous patency and resulted in immediate resolution of the patient's symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral oximetry by near-infrared spectroscopy was utilized during the procedure, and changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23240">chromophore</z:chebi> concentrations correlated directly with angiographic and clinical resolution of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Near-infrared spectroscopy can provide continuous feedback during thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and may help define endpoints of such intervention </plain></SENT>
