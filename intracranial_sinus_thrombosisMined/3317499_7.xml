<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imaging in these infants consisted of pretreatment cranial ultrasonography (US), daily US studies while on ECMO, and follow-up cranial computed tomography (CT) after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were findings of abnormalities in 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty had <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp>, often of unusual extent and distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen additional infants had nonhemorrhagic abnormalities alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> considered to be major was seen in 12% of infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhages</z:hpo>, and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were the most significant abnormalities, with a 50% mortality (eight of 16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No lateralization was noted with respect to distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> sites or areas of nonhemorrhagic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>US was a sensitive but imperfect screening tool for intracranial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities missed with US included peripheral and small parenchymal lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, and sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
