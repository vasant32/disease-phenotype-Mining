<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> in children using antibiotics combined with retroauricular puncture and grommet insertion is effective compared with "standard management" with mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary pediatric center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We identified 50 patients younger than 14 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> (mean age, 32 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the children had received antibiotic drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before 2002, a subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (SA) was managed by mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beginning in 2002, however, conservative management was initially attempted to avoid mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The proportion of cured children after conservative management of SA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> occurred in 30 patients already treated with antibiotics before hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On examination, 1 child had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients except 1 (who had temporozygomatic swelling) had postauricular swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Myringotomy or retroauricular puncture isolated bacteria in 38 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (43 patients) diagnosed 31 SAs, including 3 cases of sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 1 subdural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the children were cured without complications regardless of the type of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Comparing the periods before and after 2002, the number of SAs was similar (15 and 16, respectively), but the number of mastoidectomies was reduced (16 and 1, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The hospital length of stay of patients who underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was shorter than that of patients who underwent cortical mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Antibiotic drug use combined with retroauricular puncture and grommet insertion is an effective alternative to mastoidectomy in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> with SA in children </plain></SENT>
