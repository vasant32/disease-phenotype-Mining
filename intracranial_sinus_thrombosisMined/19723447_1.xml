<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (n=162) with cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> admitted to three neurological centers from 2001 to 2006 in the Isfahan City were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to the month of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group included patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that occurred while fasting (n=33) and the second group was composed of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in other months, while not fasting (n=129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the number of cases per month and compared ages, gender and the distribution of new cases during fasting versus non-fasting months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2001 to 2006, the mean number of patients' diagnosis during fasting month was 5.5 versus mean number of patients during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other non-fasting months that was 1.95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis showed a significantly increased frequency of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> events in Ramadan compared to other months (p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that fasting increases frequency of cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are inconsistent with other reported studies on arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and need to be confirmed by other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems that healthy people have no problem with regard to cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> while fasting, but susceptible persons, such as those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> and women who take oral contraceptive pills, may be at increased risk </plain></SENT>
