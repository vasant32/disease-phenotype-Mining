<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) requires a high index of suspicion owing to the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amongst the different presentations, radiological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) often leads to diagnostic errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2005 and December 2007, 233 patients with CVST were reviewed at our centre, and this report summarizes 10 cases that presented with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The early clinico-radiological pointers towards a diagnosis of CVST are highlighted and previously published reports are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 33 years (range 25-50), and the median duration from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to admission was 5 days (range 2-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, there was radiological evidence of SAH with or without associated parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or other signs of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAH was usually localized, involving the sulci of the cerebral convexity and sparing the basal cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aetiologically, there were two cases with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002872'>polycythaemia</z:mp> and one case each of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (APLA) syndrome, post-partum state, oral contraceptive use and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> because of diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients improved with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy despite the presence of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Localized SAH (whether focal, unilateral or bilateral), especially when confined to the parasagittal or dorsolateral convexity of the brain and without involvement of the basal cisterns, may provide an early pointer towards an underlying CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of predisposing factors for CVST accords a further diagnostic hint </plain></SENT>
