<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This anomaly makes the implantation of pacemaker leads more difficult; therefore, accurate preintervention diagnosis of this anomaly is valuable for the interventionalist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A patient in which the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005301'>persistent left superior vena cava</z:hpo> coexisting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011666'>absent right superior vena cava</z:hpo> was made echocardiographically before permanent pacemaker implantation is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">Acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> was prescribed after pacemaker implantation to prevent a potentially fatal complication of coronary sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and no complication occurred during the four-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some clues for the noninvasive diagnosis of this anomaly and techniques of pacemaker implantation are also described briefly </plain></SENT>
