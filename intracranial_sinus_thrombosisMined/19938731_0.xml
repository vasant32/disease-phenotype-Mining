<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prognosis of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) has never been studied in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A simple prognostic score to predict poor prognosis of CVST has also never been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors are aiming to establish a simple and reliable prognostic score for this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The medical records of CVST patients from eight neurological training centers in Thailand who received between April 1993 and September 2005 were reviewed as part of this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical features included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (GCS), blood pressure on arrival, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, meningeal irritation sign, location of occluded venous sinuses, hemorrhagic infarction, cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure, treatment options, length of stay, and other complications were analyzed to determine the outcome using modified Rankin scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Poor prognosis (defined as mRS of 3-6) was determined on the discharge date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred ninety four patients' records, 127 females (65.5%) and mean age of 36.6 +/- 14.4 years, were analyzed Fifty-one patients (26.3%) were in the poor outcome group (mRS 3-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was 8.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis and then multivariate analysis using SPSS version 11.5 revealed only four statistically significant predictors influencing outcome of CVST They were underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, low GCS, presence of hemorrhagic infarction (for poor outcome), and involvement of lateral sinus (for good outcome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thai venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prognostic score (TV-SPSS) was derived from these four factors using a multiple logistic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A simple and pragmatic prognostic score for CVST outcome has been developed with high sensitivity (93%), yet low specificity (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The next study should focus on the validation of this score in other prospective populations </plain></SENT>
