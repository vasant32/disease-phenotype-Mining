<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors report duplex sonographic findings in 138 healthy subjects without central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful insonation was possible in 70.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral insonation was achieved in 86 subjects (62.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 1 vertebral vein was detected in 23 persons (16.7%), whereas no vein was found in 29 persons (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors observed a marked variation of peak flow velocities ranged (5-81 cm/s, mean +/- standard deviation, 23.9 +/- 12.3 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant gender-related or side-to-side differences or age influences on flow velocities were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors' findings may be of relevance when discussing flow velocities in the vertebral veins in cases of cerebrovenous disorders (e.g., dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) or in patients after neck dissection </plain></SENT>
