<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Information on the neurologic outcome of children who survive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children surviving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> between January 1, 1995 and July 1, 1999 were prospectively followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit severity was based on the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Outcome Measure (PSOM) developed in this study and parental response to two recovery questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictor variables for poor outcome were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-hundred twenty-three children with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 38 with sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were followed for a mean of 2.1 years (range, 0.8 to 6.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome based on PSOM assessment was: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 37%; mild deficit, 20%; moderate deficit, 26%; and severe deficit, 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcome was full recovery in 45% of patients, based on parental response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary and secondary outcome measures were moderately correlated (P &lt; .001; K = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In bivariate analysis, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type, male gender, age of at least 28 days, presence of associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e>, and need for rehabilitation therapy after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were predictors of poor outcome (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that only arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e>, and presence of rehabilitation therapy were independent predictors of poor outcome (P &lt; .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome in children after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is therefore frequent and more likely in the presence of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, rehabilitation therapy, and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e>, which justifies clinical trials of treatment strategies in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
