<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Suppurative disease in the mastoid region occasionally spreads to the adjacent dura mater of the posterior and middle cranial fossae and the sigmoid sinus by means of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, osseous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, or anatomic pathways, producing intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) should be performed early in the course of the disease to classify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> as incipient or coalescent and to detect intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the clinical features and imaging findings, the disease is managed conservatively with intravenously administered antibiotics or treated with mastoidectomy and drainage plus antibiotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT is therefore a decisive diagnostic tool in determining the type of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, magnetic resonance imaging is performed in patients with clinical symptoms or CT findings suggestive of intracranial complications because of its higher sensitivity for detection of extraaxial fluid collections and associated vascular problems </plain></SENT>
