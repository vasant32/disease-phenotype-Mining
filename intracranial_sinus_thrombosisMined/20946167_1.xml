<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the contribution of these polymorphisms could not be confirmed by other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of three haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) in GPX3 in a large family-based study sample comprising 268 nuclear families with different pediatric AIS subtypes, i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (AS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> (TS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, an independent study sample comprising 154 nuclear families of pediatric CSVT was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-point and haplotype association was assessed with the transmission disequilibrium test implemented in haploview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Single-point analysis revealed that the G allele of htSNP rs8177412 was significantly overtransmitted to affected AS children (T/U = 25 : 11, χ(2) = 5.54, P = 0.019), but not to affected TS children (T/U = 49 : 40, χ(2) = 0.91, P = 0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding GG haplotype (H2: frequency 0.18) was also significantly overtransmitted to AS children (T/U = 23 : 11, χ(2) = 4.28, P= 0.03), but not to TS children or in children with CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results remained significant following 10,000 bootstrap permutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that genetic variants of GPX3 are risk factors for AS, but not for thromboembolic AIS or CSVT, in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results further highlight the need to analyze the contribution of genetic variants to pediatric AS, TS or CSVT separately, as these subcategories probably result from different combinations of risk-conferring and protective genetic variations </plain></SENT>
