<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He suffered from left orbital pain, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235181" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">character changes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He became short tempered, and was very attached to trifles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two years prior to these symptoms, he had developed transient left abducent nerve palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Head MRI showed a thickening and enhancement of the dura mater on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced T1-weighted images, and high signal intensity lesions at bilateral frontal lobes predominantly in the white matter on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies revealed microglial proliferation in the cerebral parenchyma, and mild lymphocytic perivascular infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evidence of intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore treated him with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> pulse therapy followed by oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>His character became gradually normalized, and bilateral frontal lobe lesions seen on MRI disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first case to describe recurrent pachymeningoencephalitis with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235181" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">character changes</z:e>, and symptoms were probably due to frontal lobe dysfunction </plain></SENT>
