<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Very little is known about the long-term outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT), particularly regarding the risk of residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and further thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 77 patients with CVT diagnosed by angiography and/or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 77 patients aged 18 to 77 (mean, 38.5) years with CVT, evaluated from 1975 through 1990, was followed up for a mean of 77.8 months (range, 14 to 204 months; median, 63 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, neurological status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, recurrent CVT, other thrombotic events, and subsequent pregnancies was obtained from direct observation, mail questionnaire, or telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six of 77 patients (85.7%) had no neurological sequelae during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (14.3%) remained neurologically impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two who initially presented with isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 9 had focal signs at the time of CVT and were left with various cognitive or focal deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of 28 (14.3%) patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the 51 patients with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> developed a dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 77 patients (11.7%) suffered a second CVT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one in the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Noncerebral thrombotic events occurred in 11 patients (14.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No recurrence of CVT occurred during later pregnancies, but 1 patient had a postpartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present series, CVT has an essentially good long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The frequency of long-standing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was low, suggesting that long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> treatment is not necessary in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A second CVT or another thrombotic episode occurred in 20% of patients, stressing the need in a minority of cases for long-term anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
