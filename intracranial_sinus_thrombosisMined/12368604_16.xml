<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of anticoagulation remains unstudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study reviews the signs, symptoms, radiological evaluation, surgical treatment, and medical management of patients with otogenic sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> treated with or without anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of nine patients from 1995 to 2001 with sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were identified by a review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medical and radiological records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Signs, symptoms, diagnostic studies, treatments, and outcomes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, telephone follow-up was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Nine patients were identified over a 6-year period from 1995 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients had a mean follow-up time of 9 months (range, 1-24 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the nine patients identified, eight patients (89%) had tympanostomy tube placement, six patients (67%) had canal wall intact mastoidectomy, and one patient (11%) had canal wall down mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of the sinus was performed in four of nine patients (44%), and incision of the sinus in two of nine (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a mean duration of 12 days (range, 2-22 d) intravenously and 7 days (range, 0-21 d) orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven percent of patients (six of nine) were anticoagulated: Five patients received low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and one patient received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No mortality occurred in either the anticoagulated or non-anticoagulated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One anticoagulated patient did have persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and otorrhea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgery and antibiotic therapy are the cornerstones of the management of otogenic sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the role of anticoagulation remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because complications of embolization and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> are low in otogenic sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> patients treated with or without anticoagulation, withholding anticoagulation in selected patients is reasonable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Serial imaging to monitor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> progression is advisable </plain></SENT>
