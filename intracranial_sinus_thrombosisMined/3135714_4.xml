<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tried an approach with spin-echo techniques to eliminate flow-induced artifacts and, thus, facilitate the diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, a nonselective single-section spin-echo verification method was used as a prototype of this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients and an experimental flow phantom were used to test the validity of this concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was seen to persist as isointense or highly intense signal in the vascular lumina with the specialized sequence, while flow-related artifacts were replaced by hypointense signal, but not by signal void </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These same changes were examined both quantitatively and qualitatively in the flow phantom by using varying velocities of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although our clinical investigation concerns suspected dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the principles of these specialized spin-echo techniques can be applied successfully throughout the head to eliminate certain flow-related artifacts </plain></SENT>
