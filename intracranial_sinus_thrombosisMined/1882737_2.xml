<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a visually similar sign, seen in five (10%) of 50 patients who had delayed cranial CT scans performed at intervals greater than 30 min after injection of contrast material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This new sign (which we call the delayed delta sign) closely mimics the classic negative delta sign and may thus represent a potential visual pitfall leading to an erroneous diagnosis of sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> if only postcontrast images are viewed </plain></SENT>
