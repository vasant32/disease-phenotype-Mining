<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND--Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> may have abnormal brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lesions demonstrated on computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging often suggest the underlying cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and may prompt an invasive investigation for diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an increasingly recognized subset of patients however, the imaged lesions spontaneously resolve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While poorly understood, these 'disappearing' lesions may in fact be the consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, rather than the cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with 'disappearing' lesions are presented: the first patient had a proven cause, the second a probable one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A patient with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had an abnormal MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An angiogram confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, she was doing well; repeat imaging was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with resolution of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A patient with a long <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> history had been well controlled on medications, and had no change in frequency of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>She was found to have a left homonymous hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed a right parieto-occipital lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patient refused further work-up and was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>She returned almost a year later; repeat imaging was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION--Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and abnormal imaging suggestive of structural lesions may occasionally have lesions that resolve spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While some diagnoses remain elusive, an important consideration to exclude in these patients is <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
