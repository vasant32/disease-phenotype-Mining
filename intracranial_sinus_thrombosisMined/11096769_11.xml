<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One is attributable to small venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> with focal or multifocal central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement and is seen in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is designated Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>Nervous</z:mp> System-Neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other form is due to cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and has limited symptoms and a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is very uncommon for these two types of involvement to occur in the same individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is very likely that the two major forms have different pathogeneses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with small <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>vein inflammation</z:mp> should be considered for aggressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A substantial number of patients in this group will have a relapsing-remitting course; for some, this will evolve into a secondary progressive course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A few patients from this group will have progressive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> dysfunction from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After either treatment, an oral tapering dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> should be given over 2 to 3 months to avoid early relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some patients may require the long-term use of low maintenance doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> to prevent exacerbations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">Immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> (eg, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>), given either alone or in different combinations (eg, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>) for the long-term treatment of various systemic manifestations of BD, have not been shown to prevent the development of the neurologic complications of the disease, reduce its exacerbations, or stop its progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Immunomodulatory treatments such as interferon alfa and thalidomide have been shown to be effective in treating some of the systemic manifestations of BD, but there is no information on their effects on the development and progression of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD is treated with either intravenous unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> given together with a short course of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
