<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> raises the suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, and it is not generally recognised as a symptom of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe ten patients who presented with thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> mimicking <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, who appeared to have CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical histories of 71 patients who had CVST between 1992 and 1996 were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>48 of these took part in a randomised trial of treatment for CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by conventional angiography or magnetic resonance imaging and angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ten patients who presented with thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and clinical signs and symptoms were clinically indistinguishable from those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography at admission was interpreted as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in five patients (one with single-dose contrast), as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> in three, and as multiple intracranial haemorrhages in the remaining patients (one with single-dose contrast) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was done in six patients, and showed erythrocytes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF pressure was high in the only patient for whom it was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The best initial investigation in patients with thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is emergency computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If no abnormality is detected, lumbar puncture should be done after at least 12 h (to detect or exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CSF pressure should be measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If the CSF pressure is high or if a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of unknown origin persists, the diagnosis of CVST should be considered </plain></SENT>
