<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To gain a preliminary understanding of the role of thrombolytic therapy for the thrombosed dural sinus, we retrospectively reviewed our initial experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients, ages 25 to 71, who presented with symptomatic dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and who failed a trial of medical therapy were treated with direct infusion of urokinase into the thrombosed sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received urokinase doses ranging from 20,000 to 150,000 U/h with a mean infusion time of 163 hours (range 88 to 244 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patency of the affected dural sinus was achieved with antegrade flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients either improved neurologically over their prethrombolysis state or were healthy after thrombolysis; one of them required angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other patient improved after surgical repair of a residual dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only complications were an infected femoral access site which resolved after treatment with antibiotics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> which cleared after discontinuation of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolysis of the thrombosed dural sinus shows promise as a safe and efficacious treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study should provide the impetus for further research </plain></SENT>
