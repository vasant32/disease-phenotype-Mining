<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We included 36 Behçet's disease patients (22 male, 14 female, mean age: 34.4 +/- 8.3 years) and 20 healthy individuals (14 male, six female, mean age: 31.8 +/- 4.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole blood count, CRP and ESR were determined in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data about the patients were obtained from medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and smokers were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with MVI were taken as a separate group (8 male, 5 female, mean age: 37 +/- 8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MVI was defined as the presence of pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, vena cava inferior or superior <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to determine platelet-monocyte complexes (PMC), platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNC), basal and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>)-stimulated platelet CD62P expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with MVI had significantly higher PNC than <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients without MVI and healthy controls (P values = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PMC levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with MVI were significantly higher than in healthy controls (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The groups were similar in basal and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-stimulated platelet CD62P expression (P values &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Basal and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-stimulated CD62P expression, PMC and PNC were not significantly different between active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease versus inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients </plain></SENT>
