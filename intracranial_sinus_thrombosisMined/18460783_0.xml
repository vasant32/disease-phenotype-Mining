<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two CVT patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age, clinical manifestations, imaging, treatment, and prognosis were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Their age ranged from 15 to 58 (mean 33.0+/-8.8) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine were males and 13 were females (1:1.4), 41% of whom were women of childbearing age.This disease occurred rapidly, and the relative pathogeny could be found in most patients (59%), and the hypercoagulative state was the commonest one.The clinical manifestations were variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients had symptoms and signs of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>(86%), accompanied with or without focal neurological dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disorders of consciousness were found in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sever</z:e> conditions.The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was significantly increased, and the quantity of proteins or white blood cells in CSF was nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>.The occluded dural sinus and the clot could be visualised directly by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or digital subtraction angiogrophy (DSA).After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>,anticoagulation,application of adrenal cortex hormone and etilogical treatment,9 patients improved,7 nearly cured, 2 had no changes,1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 3 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CVT should be suspected when patients show manifestation of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or focal neurological dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI and MRA are efficient choices for the early diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> are keys to good prognosis </plain></SENT>
