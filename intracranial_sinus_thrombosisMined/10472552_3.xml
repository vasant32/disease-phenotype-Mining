<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 317 consecutive leukemic children aged 6 months to 18 years were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>288 of the 317 patients were available for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-free survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 17 (5.9%) of these 288 patients cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall event-free survival of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in patients with at least one prothrombotic defect (n = 12) was significantly reduced compared with patients without a prothrombotic defect (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>15 patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical symptoms at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, two were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the 17 patients affected (17.6%) died directly associated with the thrombotic event during induction therapy, the remaining 14 patients did not show prolonged clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prothrombotic risk factors should be included in a screening program in ALL children treated according to the BFM study protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are recommended to establish adequate prophylactic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment during ALL (BFM) polychemotherapy </plain></SENT>
