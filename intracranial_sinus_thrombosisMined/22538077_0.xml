<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the angiographic and clinical characteristics of patients with multiple DAVSs with an emphasis on the pathomechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-nine patients with DAVS were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with ≥ 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> at anatomically separate sites were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple DAVSs were categorized into synchronous (simultaneous multiplicity) or metachronous (temporal sequential development of multiplicity) types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The angiographic and clinical characteristics of these lesions were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients were diagnosed with multiple DAVSs (7.8%; synchronous, n = 7; metachronous, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 14 patients showed CVR (93%, Borden type II/III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple DAVSs were frequently associated with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (71.4%, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Synchronous DAVSs developed in association with an occluded sinus (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>De novo metachronous lesions developed in association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a previously patent dural sinus (n = 3) or reopening of an occluded sinus (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiplicity was associated with aggressive initial symptoms in 64.3% (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The newly developed lesions in the metachronous types were accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n = 1), neurologic deficit (n = 1), worsening of the initial benign symptoms (n = 2), and incidental detection (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean time interval between the initial diagnosis and de novo lesion detection was 31.3 ± 29.8 months (range, 12-92 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiplicity of DAVSs is associated with poor angiographic and clinical prognosis, requiring an aggressive treatment and management strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has a prominent role in the pathomechanism of DAVSs </plain></SENT>
