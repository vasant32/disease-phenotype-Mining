<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this small series, local intrasinus catheter-directed <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion with or without balloon thrombectomy was safe in the treatment of dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (DVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although systemic anticoagulation (SAC) is the treatment of choice, there is a lack of consensus regarding the best treatment should SAC fail or be contraindicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our institutional experience with 16 patients in whom failure of, or contraindication to, SAC occurred and who subsequently underwent intrasinus catheter-directed <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion with or without balloon thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 16 patients ranging in age from 14 days to 77 years who had intrasinus catheter-directed <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion was undertaken with 9 male and 7 female patients identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 16 patients, 4 (25%) had a contraindication to SAC and SAC failed in 12 (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Technically successful intrasinus infusion catheter placement was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of infusion was 3.3 days (range, 1-6 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive balloon thrombectomy was performed in 9 (56.3%) of 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No procedure-related mortality occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Partial and complete sinus recanalization occurred in 10 (62.5%) of 16 patients and 1 (6.3%) of 16 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (18.8%) attributed to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At most recent clinical follow-up (mean, 9.3 months), 11 (84.6%) of 13 surviving patients were independent, with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Local intrasinus catheter-directed <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion with or without adjunctive balloon thrombectomy seems to be a safe and effective treatment of DVST in patients in whom SAC failed or in whom there was a contraindication to SAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the risk for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> may be significantly lower than intrasinus infusion of thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
