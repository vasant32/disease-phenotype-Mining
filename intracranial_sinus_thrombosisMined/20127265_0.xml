<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic imaging has become an unrenounceable tool for the documentation and follow-up of intracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the early posttraumatic phase has led to a more thorough understanding of intracranial injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the cranial computed tomography (CCT) and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>)-studies of patients with traumatic head injuries for primary cerebrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 64 children (45 male, 19 female) with traumatic head injuries, CCT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The children's age ranged from 3 months to 15 years with a median age of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had initial CCT on admission to the hospital with follow-up examinations depending on clinical state and initial imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had at least one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination between 0 to 120 days after the trauma with a median time interval of 17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In five of 64 (7.8%) patients, cerebrovascular complications were found on imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial imaging within the first 24 h after the trauma detected a complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> in one patient and extensive sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after a complex skull fracture in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the transverse sinus appeared on MRI 4 to 6 days after the trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In another patient with open-skull injury, a posttraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the pericallosal artery was diagnosed on MRI 30 days after the trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that, although primary cerebrovascular lesions after traumatic head injuries in children are rare, the radiologist should be aware of the characteristic injury patterns and the time appearance of imaging findings on CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
