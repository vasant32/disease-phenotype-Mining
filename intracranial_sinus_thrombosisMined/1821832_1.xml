<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed by angiography, CT scan or autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average age was 33 years (16 to 47 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients were female and 2 male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On CT scan the 'empty delta' sign, present in 4 cases, was the most specific diagnostic feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying causes included primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocythaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>, post-angiographic investigation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, and oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases no cause was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the commonest and earliest symptom, being followed in frequency by <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>Hemiparesis</z:hpo> was the commonest sign observed, followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> and impaired level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients developed signs and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> prior to the appearance of focal neurological deficits, mostly likely due to propagation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> to cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There have been no controlled trials of therapy; however it is important to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> rapidly and effectively, and although the role of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> remains controversial, their early use may be indicated when there is no radiological evidence of haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
