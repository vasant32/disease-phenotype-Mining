<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> have become less frequent since the advent of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they continue to show a high incidence in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of these complications in Morocco and to study the epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted between January 1998 and December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presenting to the ENT department of the hôpital <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> 20 Août of Casablanca, Morocco, with complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> and hospitalized during this period were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We selected 47 out of 824 patients hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo>, for a 5.7% incidence of complications, including 15 intracranial complications (1.8%) dominated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (nine cases) and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (five cases), and 32 extracranial complications (3.8%) dominated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> (21 cases) and facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> (eight cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> was found in 70% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The open atticomastoidectomy was the surgical technique chosen in 80% of the cases, associated with specific treatment depending on the complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression was favorable in 90% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With this study, the authors review the high incidence of complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> in Morocco, and therefore the need to diagnose and treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> early to prevent the very dangerous (for example, intracranial) complications </plain></SENT>
