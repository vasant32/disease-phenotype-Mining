<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, conventional brain imaging primarily serves as a complementary test when CCT is negative or equivocal and strong clinical suspicion remains </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concept of conventional radionuclide brain imaging will likely undergo considerable change in the near future as newer radiopharmaceuticals are introduced and wider application is made of single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) imaging </plain></SENT>
