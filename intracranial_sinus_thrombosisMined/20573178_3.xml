<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: data on clinical features, neuroimaging, risk factors, and treatment were collected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children in Switzerland younger than 16 years of age who had CSVT between January 2000 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up examination and a cognitive assessment were performed (mean follow-up period 26mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences between neonates and children (patients older than 28d) were assessed and predictors of outcome were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: twenty-one neonates (14 males, seven females; mean age 9d, SD 8d) and 44 children (30 males, 14 females; mean age 8y 7mo, SD 4y 5mo) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of paediatric CSVT in Switzerland was 0.558 per 100000 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In neonates, the deep venous system was more often involved and parenchymal injuries were more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strongest predictor of poor outcome was neonatal age (odds ratio 17.8, 95% confidence interval 0.847-372.353) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most children showed global cognitive abilities within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, but impairments in single cognitive subdomains were frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: paediatric CSVT is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its outcome is poor in neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most children have good neurological outcomes, but some patients have individual neuropsychological impairments </plain></SENT>
