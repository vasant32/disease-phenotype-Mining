<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from newborn to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six children were premature neonates, five were term neonates and two were 5 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the premature neonates, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was usually associated with other problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the term neonates had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neonates, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> resolved without any specific treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the two older children, one presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These children required neurosurgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained in 9 of 13 children and showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> resolution in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three children were studied in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and convalescent stages by magnetic resonance angiography using time-of-flight techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each follow-up magnetic resonance angiogram showed improvement in venous flow consistent with their clinical course and other imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 1) CVT in children encompasses a range of clinical conditions which may or may not require neurosurgical intervention; 2) magnetic resonance imaging is superior to other modalities for the diagnosis of CVT; and 3) magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative means to monitor the evolution of CVT and efficacy of therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
