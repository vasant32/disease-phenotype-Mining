<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to analyze the effect of steroids on the outcome of patients in the International Study on Cerebral Veins and Dural Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> (ISCVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ISCVT is a prospective observational study that included 624 CVT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> or dependence at 6 months was compared between cases (patients treated with steroids) and controls (patients not treated with steroids), using 3 designs: (1) Matched case-control study (each case matched with a control for prognostic factors); (2) Nonmatched case-control study of the ISCVT cohort; (3) Case-control study in different strata according to the number of poor prognostic variables in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty (24%) patients were treated with steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(1) In the matched case-control study, poor outcome was similar in the two groups of patients (26/146 versus 17/149, OR=1.7; 95% CI 0.9 to 3.3, P=0.119) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) In the ISCVT cohort, no significant difference in poor outcomes was found whether patients were treated with steroids or not (26/146 versus 60/469, OR=1.5; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without parenchymal lesions treated with steroids had worse prognosis than those treated without steroids (8/45 versus 9/184, OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.6, P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) Treatment with steroids was not associated with a better outcome in any strata of patients according to the number of poor prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Steroids in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of CVT were not useful and were detrimental in patients without parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results do not support the use of steroids in CVT (evidence level III) </plain></SENT>
