<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Simultaneous occurrence of multiple intracerebral haemorrhages (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e>) in different arterial territories is a rare clinical event which has been reported to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo>, venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, haemorrhagic transformation of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and multiple intracranial pathologies such as vascular anomalies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is the most common etiological factor for the development of spontaneous single <z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>intracerebral bleeding</z:mp>, its role in simultaneous multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors have reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with non-traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> admitted to Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital from 1993 to 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten hypertensive patients with simultaneous multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of comparison, another 600 cases with solitary hypertensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> were also reviewed as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomographic scans and medical records concerning patients' histories, clinical presentations, locations of haematomas, associated risk factors, and outcome were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The mean age and sex distribution were similar in both patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bilateral putaminal or thalamic haemorrhages were the most common combinations of simultaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As for the individual location of haematoma, there was a strong preponderance for the supratentorial space with the thalamus being the most preferable site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was longer and the percentage of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was higher in patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other associated risk factors were similar in both groups except for higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> in multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with simultaneous multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e> had a much worse outcome compared to those with solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As with solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is still the most important etiological factor for simultaneous multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The widespread and prolonged degeneration of intracerebral arterioles predispose patients to the development of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e>, which could be justified by the longer history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and higher incidence of former <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> was identified to be significantly associated with this unusual brain event in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying the development of simultaneous multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e> is not clear although structural and haemodynamic changes of first haemorrhage may be responsible for the second one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Poorer outcome in patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e> can be explained by the concomitant destruction of crossing and non-crossing fiber tracts and bilateral diaschisis phenomenon </plain></SENT>
