<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> involving the cavernous sinus remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interdural cavernous sinus is called the lateral dural wall in the cavernous sinus, which is composed of two layers, the outer dural layer and the inner membranous layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We encountered two cases of dumbbell-shaped middle cranial fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> with interdural cavernous sinus extension, which were successfully removed by surgical means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old woman presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>decreased visual acuity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological assessment was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a dumbbell-shaped, smooth-contoured, well-enhanced mass in the right mesial temporal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lateral wall of the cavernous sinus was exposed via frontotemporal craniotomy and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> originating in the lateral wall was totally removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 41-year-old man presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> attacks and drowsy mental status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a multilobulated, well-enhanced mass in the left parasellar area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was totally resected via a transsylvian temporopolar approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mass originated from tentorial edge and extended into the cavernous sinus by dural penetration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Middle cranial fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> with interdural cavernous sinus extension can be removed more easily than other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with intracavernous sinus extension and, consequently, can be safely resected without any resulting cranial nerve deficit </plain></SENT>
