<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis had been verified by computed tomographic scans in three patients and arteriograms in two; in the sixth patient, only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was used to confirm the clinical syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, high-intensity signal was seen from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> within the affected dural sinus on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> echoes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This persistent signal intensity allowed intravascular clot to be distinguished from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> causes of increased signal such as flow-related enhancement (entry phenomenon) and even-echo rephasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging demonstrated the cause of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in three patients: two were secondary to adjacent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and one was secondary to unsuspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications such as infarction were also demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, one can easily and safely diagnose <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a dural sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> should be the imaging method of choice in patients suspected of having <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a dural sinus </plain></SENT>
