<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVT) is an uncommon cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that is usually treated medically with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy followed by long-term anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of patients with CVT who underwent rheolytic thrombectomy with the AngioJet as a first-line adjunctive treatment in addition to standard anticoagulation therapy is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospectively maintained endovascular databases at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The available clinical and imaging data were compiled at each institution and combined for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 18 months, 13 patients (seven women and six men; age range 17-73 years, median age 45 years) with CVT were treated with rheolytic thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediate (partial or complete) recanalization of the thrombosed intracranial sinuses was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a median radiographic follow-up of 7 months there was continued patency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recanalized sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was available on nine patients: modified Rankin score of 0 in four patients, 1 in three patients and 6 in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This series demonstrates the feasibility of performing mechanical thrombectomy as a first-line treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This technique facilitates the prompt restoration of intracranial venous outflow, which may result in rapid neurological and symptomatic improvement </plain></SENT>
