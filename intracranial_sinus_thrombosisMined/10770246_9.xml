<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over a period of two years (1994-1996) we treated 131 children (n=131) with minor or severe head injury requiring a cranial computed tomography (CT) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> was found in eight patients (6.1%), five with mild and three with severe cranial trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was suspected either because of a skull fracture crossing over a dural sinus or because of a hyperdensity at a dural sinus in the noncontrast CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enhanced CT scan was used to confirm <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No specific symptoms related to <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> was managed conservatively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and recovery was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of the sinus was documented to occur within three weeks to six months in six children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient showed a residual clot after five months and another did not have a follow-up CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on our data we conclude that neither surgical nor medical intervention is indicated in traumatic <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> in children </plain></SENT>
