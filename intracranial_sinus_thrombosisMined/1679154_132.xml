<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> has been used for this condition, many investigators have opposed its use because of the frequent occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we have evaluated anticoagulation with adjusted-dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for treatment of aseptic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in a randomised, blinded (patient and observer), placebo-controlled study in 20 patients (10 heparin, 10 placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of the two groups, as judged by a newly designed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>-severity scale, started to differ in favour of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group after 3 days of treatment (p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) and the difference remained significant (p less than 0.01) after 8 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, 8 of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-treated patients had a complete clinical recovery and 2 had slight residual neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, only 1 patient had a complete recovery, 6 patients had neurological deficits, and 3 patients died (p less than 0.01, modified Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional retrospective study on the relation between <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> patients was based on 102 patients, 43 of whom had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>27 of these patients were treated with dose-adjusted, intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 27 patients, 4 died (mortality 15%), and 14 patients completely recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 patients that did not receive <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, 9 died (mortality 69%) and only 3 patients completely recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that anticoagulation with dose-adjusted intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is an effective treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> is not a contraindication to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment in these patients </plain></SENT>
