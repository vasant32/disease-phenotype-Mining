<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of massive hemorrhagic venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> due to dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> along with right internal jugular vein <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 21-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and swelling of the right neck four days following discharge after his prior hospitalization two weeks ago for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> due to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017160" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastroenteritis</z:e>, when he underwent hemodialysis through right internal jugular access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On presentation, he was conscious, with swelling on right side of the neck, which was diagnosed as right internal jugular vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, he rapidly deteriorated and developed signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> despite being on treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having massive hemorrhagic cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> complicated with shift of the ventricles to the left due to dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite emergency decompressive craniotomy, he succumbed in the next two days due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coning</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic catheter-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is frequent in the intensive care units, but major complications like retrograde extension into dural sinus causing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose this major catastrophe for an early and meaningful intervention </plain></SENT>
