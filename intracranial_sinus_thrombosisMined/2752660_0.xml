<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three years before admission, the patient, a 64-year old man, had had four <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> attacks; scattered calcification shadows were disclosed by plain CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten months before the admission, he complained of progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002442'>dyscalculia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General physical examination showed no remarkable abnormalities except for bruit at the left mastoid process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although his time orientation was poor, he was otherwise fully awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010525'>finger agnosia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002442'>dyscalculia</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Right Barr√©'s sign, and exaggerated right patellar tendon reflex were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plain X-ray CT revealed calcification-like, scattered high-density areas in the floor of the cerebral cortical sulci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enhanced CT showed abnormal vessel high-density areas in both the cerebrum and brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of bilateral transverse sinuses, arterio-venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> in the left transverse sinus, and remarkably dilated cortical veins over both cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography revealed misery perfusion areas in bilateral cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We presume that the mass effect of venous engorgement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to the arterio-venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These clinical manifestations were improved by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2618">amantadine</z:chebi> and the patient was discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, he died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and an autopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pathological findings were as follows: 1) cortical and subcortical multiple-infarction in the cerebrum, 2) <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the subarachnoid space, 3) venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the cortical veins and pseudocalcification of their walls, and 4) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the transverse dural sinus </plain></SENT>
