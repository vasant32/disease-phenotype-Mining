<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A specific type of midline dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>) at the torcular Herophili with extension into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was initially seen on fetal US and was referred to fetal MRI for definite diagnosis and better delineation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Retrospective comparison to medical literature of three cases, diagnosed at our institution, of midline fetal <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed MRI findings on T2-weighted images of our three cases of fetal midline <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> and clinical outcomes of these fetuses and compared our findings to medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and clinical findings of our cases extend over 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They consist of three pregnant women, 31-39 years of age each with a single fetus, with fetal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging performed at different gestational ages (GA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Case 1 the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed at 21 5/7 weeks' GA, case 2 at 24 and 33 4/7 weeks' GA, and case 3 at 22 and 25 weeks' GA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postnatal MRI was performed in case 2 at 6 months of life and case 3 at 1 day of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up occurred during the last 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our cases, T2-W <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging demonstrated ballooned midline torcular Herophili with iso- to hypointense mass with or without focal eccentric area of greater hypointensity occupying the torcular Herophili with extension into the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Case 3 had associated leptomeningeal dural vascular malformation overlying the left cerebral hemisphere with development of migrational disorder in the left cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome consisted of fetal demise in case 1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postnatal outcome in case 2 and severe brain damage with poor postnatal outcome in case 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings of large iso-hypointense <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> with or without a focal eccentric area more hypointense to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in a dilated torcular Herophili with extension into the SSS on T2-W images corresponds to the majority of cases of this rare type of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> in the medical literature </plain></SENT>
