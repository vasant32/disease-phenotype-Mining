<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> has been associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that such a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> could predispose children to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> by permitting clot formation in response to stimuli that ordinarily would be insufficient to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We evaluated a previously well 4-year-old boy who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> after suffering minor head trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crossed-immunoelectrophoresis of his plasma showed a marked decrease of the free, active form of protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Family studies revealed that the patient's father and other paternal relatives had a similar abnormality of protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in this child was initially precipitated by minor head trauma and pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was then potentiated by inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case extends the clinical spectrum for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> and emphasizes the importance of evaluating family members to establish a specific diagnosis and therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
