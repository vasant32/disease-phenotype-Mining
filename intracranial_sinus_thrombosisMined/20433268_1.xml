<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this report, the authors describe 4 recent cases of posterior giant dural venous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in neonates diagnosed during pregnancy and encountered at 3 different institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Posterior giant venous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was diagnosed in 4 patients using antenatal ultrasonography and confirmed in 2 patients using prenatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and in 3 patients using postnatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2 children angiography was performed at the age of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy was terminated in 1 case, and the fetus underwent an autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3 children who were born presented with various degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo> and were admitted to the intensive care unit after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> were present immediately after birth, including a bulging fontanel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No endovascular treatment was used in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed in 2 cases as an attempt to alleviate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> symptoms, without any real benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A slow venous flow in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was shown by ultrasonography in the case in which the pregnancy was terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography did not show an obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> in any of the cases, but an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> secondary or contributing to the formation of the venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> is one of the physiopathological hypotheses of the cause of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, spontaneous progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and regression of the intravascular component of the venous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome was acceptable in 1 child (who had a moderate handicap after the surgery) and good for the other 2 children (who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological development) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Stratified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> of different ages are found in these giant venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasias</z:mpath> and develop within the leaves of the dura close to the confluence of the major posterior venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it appears that the formation of a progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> represents the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> evolution of these giant dural venous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasias</z:mpath>, which explains the favorable outcome in some cases without specific surgical treatment, except for resuscitation techniques </plain></SENT>
