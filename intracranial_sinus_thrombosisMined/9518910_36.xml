<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether users of oral contraceptives and in [corrected] carriers of a hereditary prothrombotic condition (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, protein C, S, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>) have an increased risk of cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Comparison of a prospective series of cases of cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with population data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Neurological teaching hospitals from different regions in the Netherlands (cases) and a representative sample of the non-institutionalised Dutch population (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 40 women aged 18-54 years with cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (cases) and 2248 women aged 18-49 years (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Current use of oral contraceptives at the time of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (cases) or at the time of the questionnaire (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalences of a hereditary prothrombotic condition in patients and in the population with odds ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 34 of 40 (85%) women with cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> used oral contraceptives, versus 1007 of 2248 (45%) of the control women; the age adjusted odds ratio was 13 (95% confidence interval 5 to 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of 36 patients (19%) had a prothrombotic deficiency, versus 7% expected in the population; this corresponds to a threefold to fourfold increase in risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women who used oral contraceptives and also carried a prothrombotic defect, the odds ratio for cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was about 30 relative to women who had neither risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of oral contraceptives and being a carrier of a hereditary prothrombotic condition increase the risk of and interact in a multiplicative way in the development of cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
