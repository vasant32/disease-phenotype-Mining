<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite adequate anticoagulation, a patient's clinical condition can rapidly deteriorate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of local thrombolysis in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> between October 2008 and January 2011 were enrolled prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progressive CVT was defined as the persistence of neurologic findings (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo>) despite at least four days (or 48 hours in patients with involvement of more than one sinus) on full anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and development of focal neurologic deficits or cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with large <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> and predisposing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent local thrombolysis with 30 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 26 patients were enrolled with a mean age of 35.5 years (range 18 to 56 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (23%) were male and twenty patients (77%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting feature was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and the most common neurologic finding was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, which was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent of women had a history of oral contraceptive pill consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one (96.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations and follow-up assessments were based on a modified Rankin scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome and recovery was defined as a mRS score of 0-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up assessments at the third week showed that 25 out of 26 recovered, with 18 having a mRS score of 0 and 7 with a mRS score of 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results show that local thrombolysis is a safe and effective treatment modality for patients suffering from progressive CVT </plain></SENT>
