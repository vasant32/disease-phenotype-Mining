<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may be related to previous episodes of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of impediments to venous outflow results in venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, predisposing to haemorrhage and cerebral parenchymal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> is an indication for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case is unusual in some respects; firstly, the patient was relatively well despite worrisome features on imaging and secondly the occluded dural venous sinuses appeared to spontaneously recanalize after treatment of the DAVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation may have had a role in avoiding <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the patient's precarious venous drainage after embolisation and in encouraging recanalization of the thrombosed dural venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
