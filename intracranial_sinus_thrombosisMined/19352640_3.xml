<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the endovascular treatment of transverse-sigmoid sinus dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (TS_dAVF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 150 consecutive patients and 348 procedures were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>Pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> (81%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (15%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (10%) were the most frequent manifestations of the TS_dAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More than half of the affected sinuses were partially or completely thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Access-wise treatment was performed transarterial (n = 33), transvenous (n = 21), or a combination thereof (n = 96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mean of 2.4 procedures per patient was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediate postprocedural occlusion rate after transarterial embolization was 30% only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transvenous treatment alone resulted in an early occlusion rate of 81%, with delayed complete obliteration of half of the remaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After combined transarterial/transvenous treatment, the angiographic cure rate was 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 88% of patients with residual shunt after the treatment showed complete occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative complication rate was 9% (n = 13), with minor adverse events in ten patients (7%) and major complications in three patients (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transvenous coil occlusion of the sinus segment with the adjacent dAVF site, eventually combined with transarterial occlusion of supplying arteries, is a very effective and well-tolerated treatment method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In selected patients, variations of these methods (e.g., sinus stenting, compartmental sinus occlusion) can be useful </plain></SENT>
