<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can be a fatal condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When systemic anticoagulation therapy fails or is high risk, endovascular chemical thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy may be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience using the Penumbra system (PS; Penumbra, Alameda, California, USA) in a series of four patients with venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients were treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the PS for venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients also underwent balloon angioplasty following the PS device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Utility of this technique was evaluated by procedural success, improvement in neurological condition, avoidance of complications and follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with restoration of flow in the occluded sinuses without the use of chemical thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complications were encountered during the procedure and no postprocedural complications were attributable to the thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> died 6 weeks after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> were caused and there was no exacerbation of pretreatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient to documented continued sinus patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurologic improvement was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients have returned for outpatient follow-up and both are doing well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment for venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with the PS is a safe and efficacious alternative to the other forms of mechanical thrombectomy reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Good clinical and radiographic results can be obtained without the need for chemical thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
