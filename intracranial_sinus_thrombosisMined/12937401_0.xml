<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography is useful for the diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the preoperative assessment of sinus patency encased by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography has been applied for suspected dural sinus occlusion in a shorter time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it has some disadvantage for the evaluation of hypervascularized enhancing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mimicking flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, we have evaluated optimal imaging technique and slice orientation and have shown that sagittal three-dimensional (3D) -phase contrast (PC) imaging is the most suitable for the non-contrast intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the optimal presaturation pulse (SAT) and velocity encoding (VENC) for the non-contrast intracranial 3D-PC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Firstly, we performed phantom experiment to assess the best SAT thickness using arterial presaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed in 7 healthy volunteers to measure the dural sinus flow velocity using a 1.5 T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Third, 3D-PC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography was performed with a VENC settings at 10, 15, 20 and 30 cm/sec for healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were displayed as maximum intensity projection images and three neuroradiologists assessed the visibility of the dural sinuses and the cortical vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean flow velocity of the dural sinuses was 6.3 cm/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the best SAT was 100 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the assessment of the visibility of the 3D-PC images, dural sinuses were adequately visualized at a VENC of 15 cm/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-contrast intracranial 3D-PC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography was optimized at 100mm thickness of SAT and a VENC of 15 cm/sec </plain></SENT>
