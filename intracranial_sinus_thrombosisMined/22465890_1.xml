<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted this randomized double-blind pilot study in the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, from March 2007 to January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants were patients aged 18-45 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> and at least 3 hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted and FLAIR MRI, but no clinically definite multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were randomized into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The case group (5 patients) received intravenous <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (1000 mg/24 hours) and intravenous erythropoietin (20,000 unit/24 hours) for 5 consecutive days, and the control group (5 patients) received intravenous <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> at the same dose as the case group, and a placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The groups were followed for one year and compared for adherence to protocol, adverse drug effects, mean duration of conversion to clinically definite MS, and MRI changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients tolerated the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient who received erythropoietin developed cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient in the control group, but no patients in the case group, fulfilled the McDonald criteria for MS during the follow-up period, but none of the participants in either group developed clinically definite MS according to the Poser criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Erythropoietin may be effective, but should be used with caution </plain></SENT>
