<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early diagnosis of cerebral transverse sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (TSVT) is difficult because of nonspecific and variable clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the diagnostic value of transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS) after administration of an echocontrast-enhancing agent (cTCCS) in clinically suspected TSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 14 patients (6 men, 8 women; mean age, 48 years; range, 18 to 70 years) with signs and symptoms suggestive of cerebral TSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Color-coded signals from the contralateral transverse sinus were displayed transtemporally before and after injections of an echocontrast agent by TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sonographic findings were correlated with MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography (MRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before echocontrast enhancement, TCCS displayed color Doppler signals in 7 of 28 transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocontrast TCCS obtained sufficient color signals in 27 of 28 transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, diagnostic confidence was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients, cTCCS identified 3 cases with symmetrical blood flow in the transverse sinus, which was confirmed by MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, asymmetry of venous blood flow was correctly assessed by cTCCS in the other 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 6 of these 10 patients, cTCCS demonstrated residual color flow signals, which on MRI/MRV corresponded to partial TSVT (4 cases) and to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> (1 case) of the transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One case of complete thrombotic occlusion of the transverse sinus was missed by cTCCS because of color Doppler signals originating from an adjacent dural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Echocontrast TCCS diagnosis of occlusion of a transverse sinus was confirmed by MRI/MRV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of transverse sinus, n = 1; complete TSVT, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Systolic peak flow velocities were significantly decreased in hypoplastic or partially occluded transverse sinus (9.4 +/- 4.0 cm/s) and significantly increased contralaterally (28.4 +/- 6.5 cm/s) with respect to patients with symmetrical appearance of the transverse sinus (17.5 +/- 1.9 cm/s) (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCCS examination of the cerebral venous system is difficult without contrast media application and almost useless for the study of TSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, cTCCS is of practical value in the initial workup of patients with clinically suspected TSVT and may provide further insight for follow-up studies in view of monitoring the recanalization </plain></SENT>
