<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVT) is a potentially serious but treatable disorder that has been underdiagnosed in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delay in diagnosis and treatment of this disorder has resulted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of one of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To review the local experience with CVT in order to identify factors that may allow diagnosis and appropriate treatment decisions to be made more readily in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of CVT diagnosed or treated at Auckland Hospital between 1990 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five cases of CVT were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of cases diagnosed increased from less than one per year in 1990-94 to eight in 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs at presentation included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (96%), focal neurological deficits (60%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (40%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed diagnosis after admission to hospital occurred in two young women presenting with neurological symptoms during pregnancy or puerperium, in two cases in whom focal symptoms were not explained by negative computed tomography and in five cases presenting with intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and their condition remained stable or improved after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of CVT should be considered in women with any neurological symptoms during pregnancy or puerperium and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of unexplained intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CVT should also be considered in cases of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, particularly when associated with focal neurological symptoms or signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance venography is the investigation of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> remains the mainstay of treatment, even in the presence of intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
