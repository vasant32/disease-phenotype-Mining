<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred examinations were performed prospectively in 96 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The velocity was determined with an angle correction at 30-60 degrees and was obtained with and without gentle transducer compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was identified in two patients by the absence of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple t-tests for independent measures showed no clinically significant differences between flow velocities with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo>, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that color flow Doppler can accurately diagnose superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and may be used to screen high risk neonates such as those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> elsewhere or those treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No clinically significant associations were found between superior sagittal sinus flow velocity and any of the parameters evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
