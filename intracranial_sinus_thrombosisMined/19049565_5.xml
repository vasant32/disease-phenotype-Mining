<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Among the nine children with IIH, five showed stenosis (n = 5) and occlusion (n = 1) of cerebral venous sinus on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (n = 4) or conventional angiography (n = 1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging performed in four children showed complete regression of the venous pathology in one and partial regression in two of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cerebral venous sinus obstruction is frequent and frequently transient in pediatric IIH and suggest that stenoses may result from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
