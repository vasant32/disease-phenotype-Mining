<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To describe a population of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, analyzing clinical presentation, risk factors, treatment and evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective and longitudinal review of children from 0 to 17 years of age diagnosed with sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was conducted, during the period of time between 2004 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty one cases with cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were identified, 18 of them were boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation included 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and 13 with high intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> as a risk factor in 23 patients, 3 newborns with obstetric trauma, 5 patients with prothrombotic states, 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e>, 5 with more than one risk factor and 1 with none </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was done by magnetic resonance imaging in 18 patients, computed tomography in 11 and magnetic resonance angiography in the other 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding location, 16 patients showed compromise of the transverse sinus, 4 of the superior longitudinal sinus, another 4 an affectation of the sigmoid sinus, 2 of the cavernous sinus and 5 with a combination of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy was done in 21 patients and treatment abstention in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients suffered complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to anticoagulation therapy or sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No recurrent symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in long term follow up was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sinovenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thromboses</z:e> are an important but underestimated cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical suspicion should be high, in patients with risk factors and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
