<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We presented a patient of spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (SIH), in which radionuclide cisternography demonstrated multiple CSF leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 51-year-old previously healthy woman awoke with a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> that were almost completely relieved by lying flat (day 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was not relieved by <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day 10, she visited our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination showed no abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 50 mmH2O, protein level of 64 mg/dl, 21 erythrocytes 21/microliter, and 4 lymphocytes/microliter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cranial MRI on day 11 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> infusion demonstrated diffuse thickening and enhancement of the meninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No signs of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-111 radionuclide cisternography demonstrated early accumulation of the tracer in the urinary bladder and CSF leakage at the upper thoracic level on the left side, at the lower thoracic level on both sides, and at the lumbar level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that the scintigram taken 4 hours after tracer injection demonstrated CSF leakage at the injection site but not in the upper thoracic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient kept sitting for about 20 minutes just before the images were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Spinal MRI did not show meningeal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath> and epidural fluid collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ten days of bed-rest and transfusion failed to relieve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Epidural patching with 7 ml of autologous blood performed at the Th2/3 interspace partially relieved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five days later, a second epidural patching was performed at Th11/12, which was slightly effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A third epidural patching at L3/4 was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>On day 32, a fourth epidural patching was performed at Th1/2 while the patient was lying down on her left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Repeated cranial MRI with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> infusion performed on day 47 showed resolution of the abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the second case report of SIH with double CSF leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>To localize multiple leaks, radionuclide cisternography should be performed with a patient in various positions just before images are obtained </plain></SENT>
