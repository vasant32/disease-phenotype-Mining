<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms that are most frequently involved in its pathogenesis are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398359" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Trousseau's syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, and the release of mucin by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondarily, non <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, septic or neoplastic cell embolism, venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> secondary to radiotherapy have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Case 1: a 27-year-old male who presented a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the right thalamus with a torpid progression and digestive complications; neuroimaging studies revealed unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of the head of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 2: a 53-year-old male with repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (left sylvian and right occipitotemporal) and progressive neurological deterioration secondary to disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e>, which had its origins in the body and tail of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the diagnostic explorations carried out in an attempt to determine the aetiopathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The post mortem study in the second patient revealed the existence of a non <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, which was taken as being one of the mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenic mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> are discussed and the primary and secondary forms are differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We highlight the idea that when dealing with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with an unknown aetiology and a torpid progression, the neurologist must consider the existence of a concealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as its first manifestation </plain></SENT>
