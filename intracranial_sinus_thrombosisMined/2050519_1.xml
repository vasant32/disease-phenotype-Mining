<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correct significance of these equivocal MRI findings of possible venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> must be understood so that unnecessary and potentially harmful therapies are not employed, and so that appropriate management of what may otherwise be a typical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> syndrome may be undertaken </plain></SENT>
