<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (mean age 40.6 +/- 16.5 years) with presumptive CVST underwent cerebral MRI including 2D TOF and ec 3D MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiologic findings and clinical outcome were correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRV studies were evaluated by two neuroradiologists in a blinded manner for image quality, assessment of various sinus, internal cerebral veins (ICV), vein of Labb√© and Galen (VL/VG) as well as for additional imaging procedures required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity/specificity of ec 3D MRV amounted to 85.7%/97.2% as compared with 2D TOF 71.4%/55.6 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ec 3D MRV performed superior in terms of image quality as well as assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sinus and veins except for the straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional imaging procedures were less often required in ec 3D MRV studies (28% vs. 66% for 2D TOF MRV; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was significantly increased by using ec 3D MRV (93.1% vs. 70.9% of readings) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of our study provide additional evidence for the superiority of ec 3D compared with 2D TOF <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography for the diagnosis or exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CVST in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
