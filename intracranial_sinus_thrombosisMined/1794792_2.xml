<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Color coding allows more rapid vessel localization and more precise definition of sample volume localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow direction and blood velocity in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery and vein, as well as in the ophthalmic artery, were evaluated under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological conditions using current B-scan Doppler instruments with color coding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with central <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 9 with central vein occlusion, and 9 with orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> were compared with a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venous prethrombosis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the blood velocities were not significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> had contradictory findings, presumably since recanalization had already taken place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echographic flow imaging might be most useful when, particularly after treatment, flow velocity patterns in the orbital vessels are evaluated, and when angiographic procedures can be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Illustrative cases such as spontaneous dura-cavernous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> versus cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> show that difficult diagnostic decisions can be made easier </plain></SENT>
