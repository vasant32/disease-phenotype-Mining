<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and clinical consequences of asparaginase-associated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five newly diagnosed children and adolescents aged 0.4-21 years with ALL or lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were retrospectively evaluated for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were treated according to the ALLIC-BFM 2002 protocol between 2002 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting cholesterol levels were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) in 42/65 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prior to treatment, mean cholesterol level was 149 +/- 50 mg/dl, and increased to maximal level 274 +/- 124 mg/dl during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean TG level during treatment was 459 +/- 526 mg/dl (range 54-3,009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (28%) had TG levels &lt;200 mg/dl, 18 (43%) had 200-400 mg/dl, 3 (7%) had 400-600 mg/dl, 4 (10%) between 600 and 1,000 mg/dl, and 5 (12%) patients had &gt;1,000 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was found between TG levels and age or gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the 12 patients with TG &gt;400 mg/dl developed left saggital sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and left frontal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TG level at the time of the event was 2,640 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the five patients with TG levels &gt;1,000 mg/dl developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Children with TG levels between 400 and 600 mg/dl were treated by fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fibrates and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were added to those with levels &gt;600 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children upon completion of asparaginase treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in children with ALL during asparaginase therapy are relatively common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We recommend measuring TG before and during asparaginase treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Initiation of conservative treatment could prevent further increase of TG and decrease the risk of potential complications </plain></SENT>
