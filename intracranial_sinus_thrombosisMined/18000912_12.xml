<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the neuroimaging findings and neurological changes in 17 unpublished patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>Macrocephaly</z:hpo>-Capillary Malformation (M-CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This syndrome has been traditionally known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>Macrocephaly</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>Cutis Marmorata</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Telangiectatica Congenita</z:e> (M-CMTC), but we explain why M-CM is a more accurate term for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the 17 patients with available brain MRI or CT scans and compared their findings with features identified by a comprehensive review of published cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter irregularities with increased signal on T2-weighted images were commonly observed findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A distinctive feature in more than half the patients was cerebellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> associated with rapid brain growth and progressive crowding of the posterior fossa during infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four such cases, we confirmed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> was an acquired event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, with the development of these findings, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> (frequently obstructive) and dilated dural venous sinuses were observed in conjunction with prominent Virchow-Robin spaces in many of those in whom cerebellar tonsil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> had developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We postulate that this constellation of unusual features suggests a dynamic process of mechanical compromise in the posterior fossa, perhaps initiated by a rapidly growing cerebellum, which leads to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the venous drainage with subsequently compromised cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which increases the posterior fossa pressure and leads to acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We make a distinction between congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Chiari I malformation</z:hpo> and acquired cerebellar tonsil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also observed numerous examples of abnormal cortical morphogenesis, including focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002126'>polymicrogyria</z:hpo> which primarily involved the perisylvian and insular regions, and cerebral and/or cerebellar asymmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other findings included a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002389'>cavum septum pellucidum</z:hpo> or vergae, thickened corpus callosum, prominent optic nerve sheaths and a single case of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient was found to have a frontal perifalcine mass resembling a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> at age 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the second apparent occurrence of this specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in M-CM </plain></SENT>
