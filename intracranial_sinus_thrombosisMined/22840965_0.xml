<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the frequency and predictors of presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) and their influence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> recurrence and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study, between 1995 and 2011, included 90 consecutive patients with CVST diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters like frequency, type (presenting, early, and late), and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, precipitating causes of CVST, and underlying prothrombotic conditions, were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The location of infarction on MRI and the number of sinuses involved on MRV, were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were prescribed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome at 6 months was categorized into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, poor, partial and complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 42 patients with CVST presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (focal 11, focal with secondary generalized 19, and generalized tonic clonic 16), of whom 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, supratentorial lesion (P=0.005), frontal (P=0.02) or parietal lobe (P=0.04) involvement and haemorrhagic lesion (P=0.002) were associated with higher risk of presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, only supratentorial parenchymal lesion on MRI (odds ratio [OR]=4.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-15.08, P=0.005) was independently associated with higher risk of presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 4 patients had early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and none had late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, 10 patients died and 73 patients had complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P=1.00) and 6-month functional outcome (P=0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: About half the patients with CVST had presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> which was independently related to supratentorial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were not related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or 6-month outcome </plain></SENT>
