<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we describe an unusual case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> presenting with CVST in whom the diagnosis of CVST was suspected on the basis of clinical findings along with brain CT scan, and finally was confirmed by brain MRI and magnetic resonance venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment was started immediately; but unfortunately the patient died one week after hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> provoked by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> generated the CVST as brain MRI did not indicate any evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastasis</z:e>; therefore, direct invasion of the sinus by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is less likely; on the other hand, we should not omit the possible role of microscopic sinus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
