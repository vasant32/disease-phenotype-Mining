<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, which has many overlapping symptoms with non-thrombotic cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite these similarities, their therapeutic regimens and outcomes are entirely different, and treatment delay is life-threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to address their clinical differences to help promote proper patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 34 cases of CVST and 34 cases of non-thrombotic CVSS diagnosed with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> within 7days) were consecutively enrolled in this prospective non-randomized and controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences between CVST and CVSS in their clinical manifestation, plasma biomarkers, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> or DSA imaging were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CVST and CVSS overlap in many ways, but differ in their respective medical histories and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 20.6% of CVST and 64.7% of CVSS occur without a definitive medical history, and 70.6% of CVST and 64.7% of CVSS occur without focal neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of CVST, d-dimer and fibrinogen are found to be abnormally elevated in 94.1% and 73.5% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the CVSS group, d-dimer and fibrinogen are only elevated in 17.6% and 5.9% of cases, respectively (binary logistic regressions test, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the CVST group, the predominant features in MRI/MRV and DSA imaging include local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, flow void signal loss, non-visualization, and a local filling defect sign at the involved sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in the CVSS group, imaging revealed symmetrically small bilateral ventricles and the spread of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in MRI/MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DSA imaging in the CVSS group revealed external compression and a narrow sinus with disproportionate venous engorgement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite these findings, positive imaging only appears in a minority of patients in the two groups during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (Table 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DSA may be beneficial to diagnose CVST in ambiguous patients suspected to have either CVST or CVSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinically useful biomarkers (d-dimer and fibrinogen) may predict CVST in the emergency room in the ambiguous patients with or without equivocal MRI/MRV imaging </plain></SENT>
