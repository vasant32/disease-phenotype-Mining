<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with clinical findings suggestive of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were examined with venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and spin-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maximum-intensity-projection reconstructions and individual sections of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms were examined for direct and indirect signs of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by assessing flow signal from the major sinuses, the jugular bulb, upper jugular veins, ascending cortical veins (occlusion or increased flow due to formation of collaterals), diploe (emissary) veins and extracranial veins, and the deep subcortical veins (Galen's and internal cerebral veins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct signs of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms included lack of typical high flow signal from a sinus that did not appear aplastic or hypoplastic on single sections from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and the frayed appearance of the flow signal from a sinus after recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indirect signs of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> included evidence of formation of collaterals, unusually prominent flow signal from deeper medullary veins, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, visualization of emissary veins, and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When available, conventional angiograms were evaluated by analogous criteria as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction or cut-film angiograms were available for correlation in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was repeated up to eight times during the course of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were compared with results in 10 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of the diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was based either on conventional angiographic findings or on the changes seen in follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could be ruled out in 25 of the 42 patients on the basis of clinical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic findings that indicated dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, conventional angiography confirmed the diagnosis in nine patients, and changes seen on repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms during follow-up confirmed the diagnosis in nine patients as well (one patient's diagnosis was confirmed by both techniques) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Individual frames from two-dimensional fast low-angle shot sequences allowed direct visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Limited spin-echo sequences as performed here provided inconsistent findings and were insufficient for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the 10 control subjects, attenuation of flow signal was seen in the torcular Herophili in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies; one subject had a nonpathologic variant of the sinojugular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography is the technique of choice for diagnostic evaluation and follow-up of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and it is reliable as the sole examination for this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic findings are unremarkable and other abnormalities must be ruled out, routine spin-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging should be performed </plain></SENT>
