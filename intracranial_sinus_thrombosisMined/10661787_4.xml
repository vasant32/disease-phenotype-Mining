<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Etiologically, they are thought to be due to maldevelopment of the arachnoid or secondary to trauma or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postnatally, many are asymptomatic and remain quiescent for years, although others expand and cause symptoms by compressing adjacent brain and/or expanding the overlying skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Being congenital, it should be possible to identify them in the fetus, and this has proved to be so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>But are they anatomically similar and do they behave the same as those detected postnatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen fetuses with fluid-filled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were identified from the database of the Fetal Management Unit at St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mary's Hospital in Manchester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five were diagnosed at or before 20 weeks of gestation, 4 between 21 and 30 weeks, and 6 at 31 weeks or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were in the supratentorial compartment, and 2 in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven fetuses were delivered, and 4 pregnancies were terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of the born children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265220" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pallister-Hall syndrome</z:e> and died on day 19, and another had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175713" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AIC">Aicardi's syndrome</z:e>, is retarded and has fits, 1 with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0007291'>posterior fossa cyst</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in utero and was delivered early for the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, he is moderately mentally delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 8 children, 1 has been lost to follow-up, and 7 appear to be reaching their early milestones on time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 4 terminated fetuses had a postmortem examination, 2 did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cysts</z:hpo>; 1 had an expanding glioependymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> which had destroyed most of the cerebral hemispheres, and the other had a sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with extensive cavitation of one cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
