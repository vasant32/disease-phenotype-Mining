<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate a blood pool contrast agent and water-selective excitation imaging at 3 T for high spatial and high contrast imaging of brain vessels including the veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 48 clinical patients (47 ± 18 years old) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on clinical findings, twenty-four patients received a single dose of standard extracellular Gadoterate-meglumine (Dotarem®) and 24 received the blood pool contrast agent Gadofosveset (Vasovist®) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After finishing routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> protocols, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were investigated with two high spatial resolution (0.15 mm (3) voxel size) gradient echo sequences in random order in the equilibrium phase (steady-state) as approved by the review board: A standard RF-spoiled gradient-echo sequence (HR-SS, TR/TE 5.1/2.3 msec, FA 30°) and a fat-suppressed gradient-echo sequence with water-selective excitation (HR-FS, 1331 binominal-pulse, TR/TE 8.8/3.8 msec, FA 30°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The images were subjectively assessed (image quality with vessel contrast, artifacts, depiction of lesions) by two investigators and contrast-to-noise ratios (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi>) were compared using the Student's t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The image quality and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> in the HR-FS were significantly superior compared to the HR-SS for both contrast agents (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> was also improved when using the blood pool agent but only to a minor extent while the subjective image quality was similar for both contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The utilized sequence with water-selective excitation improved image quality and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> properties in high spatial resolution imaging of brain arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The used blood pool contrast agent improved the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> only to a minor extent over the extracellular contrast agent </plain></SENT>
