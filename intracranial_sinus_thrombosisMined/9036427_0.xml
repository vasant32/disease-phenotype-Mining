<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the nonspecific symptomatology, as well as the manifold etiology, clinical diagnosis may be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical CT in the detection of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients with clinically suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> CT angiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to acquire also arterial vessels, a short delay of about 22 s after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the application of contrast medium was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By this method we found an occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in two patients with clinically suspected sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an "empty delta" sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With irregular outlines the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MIP reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and the pathological collateral venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In three patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms were available for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The smaller veins, such as the v. vermis inferior, were less clearly depicted than in CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CT angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It can be performed immediately after non-enhanced CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>According to our present experience CT angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
