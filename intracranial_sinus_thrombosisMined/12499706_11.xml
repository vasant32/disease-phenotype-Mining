<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of 79 patients with cerebral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, who were treated with a fixed regimen of dose-adjusted intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, to determine predictors of a fatal course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The parameters investigated were the state of consciousness and the presence of intracranial haemorrhage (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) at the start of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment, involvement of the internal venous system, mean delay from initial symptom to stupor or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and from initial symptom to hospital admission, focal neurological deficits, mean intracranial circulation time (ICT) on conventional angiography, and age and sex distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 10% in this series (8/79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a strong link between the outcome and the level of vigilance: 53% of the patients with stupor or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> at the start of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy died (8/15), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 64 patients with no more than mildly impaired vigilance survived (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mean age and mean ICT were significantly higher in the group of patients who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a statistical trend (p = 0.056) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> to be more frequent in cases with fatal outcome, but there was reason to assume that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> represented an epiphenomenon of a severe course rather than an independent predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other investigated parameters were not linked with a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
