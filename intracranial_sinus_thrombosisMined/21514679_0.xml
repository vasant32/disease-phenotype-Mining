<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An inpatient database from a tertiary care pediatric hospital was queried from 1999 to 2010 for the diagnosis code [325] <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of intracranial venous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographics, extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, surgical intervention, use of anticoagulation, and the presence of recanalization on follow-up imaging was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (10 male, 5 female) were identified with otogenic lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (73.3%) had evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the transverse sinus, while 10 patients (66.7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the internal jugular vein, and one patient (6.7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (33%) had otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (80%) underwent operative manipulation of the lateral sinus including: three decompressions 20%, three needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> 20%, and six venotomies with evacuation of clot or pus 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were anticoagulated with low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and three patients were not anticoagulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of fourteen patients (71.4%) who underwent follow-up magnetic resonance venography had evidence of partial (57.1%) or complete (14.3%) recanalization of the lateral sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients with otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> recovered as determined by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fundoscopic exam and recovery of abducens <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recanalization of the lateral intracranial venous sinus occurred in the majority of the patients in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of operative intervention and/or anticoagulation remains unclear </plain></SENT>
