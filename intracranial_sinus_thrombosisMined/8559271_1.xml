<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) in the posterior cranial fossa detected after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 52-year-old male consulted a neighbourhood hospital for sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though the obstruction of the right internal carotid artery was revealed angiographically, his symptoms improved after conservative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, his consciousness deteriorated and he developed left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, he was transferred to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After thorough examination, right STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis surgery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 2 months after surgery, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> developed and gradually exacerbated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since it was thought to be due to increased blood flow in the right superficial temporal artery, it was kept under observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On angiogram, 8 months after surgery, good blood flow supplied from the right superficial temporal artery to the territory of the right middle cerebral artery was shown, and a dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> fed by the right occipital artery was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen months after the surgery, an enlarged dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> with backflow to the superficial cerebral veins fed by the enlarged right occipital artery and right ascending pharyngeal artery was revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Embolization therapy to the right occipital and ascending pharyngeal artery was performed using coils and ivalon, and irradiation of 30 Gy was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After this treatment, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On angiography 2 years later, transverse sinus was slightly visible via the right occipital artery and ascending pharyngeal artery, but the dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The origin of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In our case, dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was not found before the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis surgery, and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was not found throughout the course of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the occult dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was disclosed and enlarged by the increased blood flow through the external carotid artery via the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> seemed to be congenital in origin </plain></SENT>
