<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective chart review with a sent questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral centre, University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intratemporal and intracranial complications of OM over the past 15 years (1990-2004) in the study hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, treatment and outcome of patients with intratemporal and intracranial complications of OM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients aged 16-75 years were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual age-adjusted incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intratemporal and intracranial complications was 0.32/100 000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-one (82%) of the complications were intratemporal and nine (18%) were intracranial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear disease</z:e> behind the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> (AOM) in 80% (40/50), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> (COM) in 12% (6/50) and COM with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> in 8% (4/50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>Mastoiditis</z:hpo> was complicated by subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">labyrinthitis</z:e> and facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> in 7% (3/41), 15% (6/41) and 32% (13/41) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy was performed on 56% (28/50) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four (44%) of the intracranial complications were intracranial abscesses, four (44%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and one (11%) was sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Permanent hearing loss occurred in 13 (26%) patients and one patient died due to otogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severe complications of the OM in adults are rare in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The commonest cause is AOM rather than COM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Operative treatment is predominantly needed for intracranial complications and intratemporal abscesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Complications of OM are still associated with considerable morbidity, and early recognition is most likely to form the basis for effective treatment </plain></SENT>
