<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> is widely used to treat <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> increases the risk of neurological involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patient files from the Ophthalmology Department for the period 2000-2005 were screened retrospectively, and the occurrence of neurological involvement and its relationship to ocular severity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 454 patients with BD were seen at the Ophthalmology Department in this period, including 24 who had been referred from the Neurology Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excluded from the study were 47 patients who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and 114 patients with an inadequate follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 269 patients had been treated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (Group I, n=92), other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> (Group II, n=132), or no treatment other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (Group III, n=45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with neurological symptoms were sent to the Neurology Department for evaluation: 20 from Group I [10 with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, 1 with sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 8 with parenchymal neurological involvement (pNBD)]; 13 from Group II [10 with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 1 with pre-morbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, 1 with sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 1 with pNBD]; and 5 from Group III with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of pNBD was significantly higher in Group I, and included atypical features such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and MRI lesions as well as the typical symptoms of brainstem involvement and pleocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eye involvement tended to be more severe in Group I, and the difference remained significant both when milder cases were excluded from the analysis (6 vs. 0; p=0.03) and when severe cases were excluded (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>pNBD was significantly more frequent in patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> alone than in those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> plus another agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> seems to be associated with an increased risk of developing pNBD, although the reason for this is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A prospective trial is needed to shed light on this problem </plain></SENT>
