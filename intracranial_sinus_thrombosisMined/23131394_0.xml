<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 11 patients during postpartum period with CVST who received IST during July 2007-November 2011 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urokinase was infused into the sinuses via a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) was performed to assess the recanalization of venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before discharge, the intracranial pressure in 11 patients was under 200 mmH(2)O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRV confirmed that venous sinus of 9 patients were smooth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cortex venous and deep venous recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous sinus of 2 patients recanalized partly, and cortex venous and deep venous had compensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>9 patients had good outcome and 2 patients had only mild deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intrasinus thrombolysis is safe and effective in patients with severe cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during postpartum period </plain></SENT>
