<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Renal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, although rare in adults, is well recognized in neonates and is one of the most common manifestations of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of renal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> remains unidentified in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of renal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a neonate associated with elevated maternal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A full-term female infant, appropriate for gestational age, was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery to an 18-year-old primigravida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infant's birth weight was 3680 g and the Apgar scores were eight and nine at 1 and 5 minutes respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the infant in the newborn nursery revealed a palpable mass in the right lumbar area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tests revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> and a high serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level of 1.5 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An abdominal ultrasound Doppler flow study demonstrated an enlarged right kidney, right renal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and progression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> to the inferior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of saggital sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An extensive work-up of parents for hypercoagulable conditions was remarkable for a higher plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) level of 73 mg/dl and an elevated fibrinogen level of 512 mg/dl in the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> paternal levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) level in the neonate was also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The neonate was treated with low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (enoxaparin) at 1.5 mg/kg/day every 12 hours for 2 months, at which time a follow-up ultrasound Doppler flow study showed resolution of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in both the renal vein and the inferior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There have been no studies to date that have explored the effect of abnormal maternal risk factors on fetal hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A case-control study is required to investigate whether elevated levels of maternal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) may be a risk factor for neonatal thrombotic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although infants with this presentation are typically treated with anticoagulation, there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities vary between study and treatment centers which warrants the establishment of a national registry </plain></SENT>
