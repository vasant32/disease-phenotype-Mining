<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The long T2 and short T1 signals in the related region of multiple venous sinuses on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> were important characteristics for the diagnosis before angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 12 cases, the treatment consisted of intermittent injection of urokinase via common carotid artery and oral administration of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracranial pressure of 11 cases reduced to lower than 300 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> and clinical deficits were markedly improved in 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Re-angiography of 4 cases found partial recanalization in 2 in one week after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraoarterial thrombolysis combined with general anticoagulation in the treatment of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in cerebral venous sinuses may be an effective meansure </plain></SENT>
