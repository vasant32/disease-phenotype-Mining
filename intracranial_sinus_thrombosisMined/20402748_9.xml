<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) is a rather <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> which accounts for &lt;1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is still frequently overlooked or delayed as a result of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and the often <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or lingering <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current therapeutic measures which are used in clinical practice include the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> such as dose-adjusted intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or body weight-adjusted subcutaneous low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH), the use of thrombolysis and symptomatic therapy including control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Library to review the strength of evidence to support these interventions and the preparation of recommendations on the therapy of CVST based on the best available evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Review articles and book chapters were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recommendations were reached by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Where there was a lack of evidence but consensus was clear we stated our opinion as good practice points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CVST without contraindications for anticoagulation (AC) should be treated either with body weight-adjusted subcutaneous LMWH or with dose-adjusted intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (level B recommendation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitant intracranial haemorrhage (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) related to CVST is not a contraindication for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The optimal duration of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Oral AC may be given for 3 months if CVST was secondary to a transient risk factor, for 6-12 months in patients with idiopathic CVST and in those with "mild" <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, such as heterozygous factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutation and high plasma levels of factor VIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Indefinite AC should be considered in patients with recurrent episodes of CVST and in those with one episode of CVST and 'severe' <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, such as antithrombin, protein C or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, homozygous factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and combined abnormalities (good practice point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either systemic or local thrombolysis in patients with CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If patients deteriorate despite adequate AC and other causes of deterioration have been ruled out, thrombolysis may be a therapeutic option in selected cases, possibly in those without large <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (good practice point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There are no controlled data about the risks and benefits of certain therapeutic measures to reduce an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (with brain displacement) in patients with severe CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, in severe cases with impending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> craniectomy can be used as a life-saving intervention (good practice point) </plain></SENT>
