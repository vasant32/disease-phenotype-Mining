<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Venous sinus disease must be excluded before diagnosing idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> but is found only rarely in typical cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is the technique of choice for investigating this, and provides images that are diagnostic and easy to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent work using more invasive techniques has documented pressure gradients and stenoses in the lateral venous sinuses in many cases of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the reason for this discrepancy and to establish whether there are characteristic appearances on MRV in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that are routinely overlooked in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRVs from 20 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were reviewed, unblinded, by two neuroradiologists, and their appearances rated for focal narrowings and signal gaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group of 40 asymptomatic volunteers, matched for age and sex with the patient group, was recruited prospectively for MRV, and their scans rated in the same way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lateral sinuses presented a range of appearances with quite different distributions in the two groups (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bilateral lateral sinus flow gaps were seen in 13 of 20 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and in none of 40 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A historical failure to use <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy controls to establish the boundaries between imaging artefact, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anatomical variant, and disease means that the pathological significance of the different appearances of the lateral sinuses on MRV has not so far been appreciated </plain></SENT>
