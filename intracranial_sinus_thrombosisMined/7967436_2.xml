<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case history of a 7-year old girl who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sinus sagittalis superior during ALL-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging after the child became symptomatic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until this event the girl had been treated already for two weeks with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and E. coli-asparaginase (4 infusions) </plain></SENT>
