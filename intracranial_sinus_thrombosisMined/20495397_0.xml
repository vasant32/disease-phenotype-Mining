<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Detachable endovascular coils have become a common treatment strategy for carotid cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (CCAs), but previously unrecognized postprocedure complications may emerge as longer follow-up data are accumulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, the authors document the first known cases of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathy</z:e> following CCA coiling in 3 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom present at least a year postprocedure without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> regrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential mechanisms underlying this syndrome are discussed as well as their implications on the selection and optimal endovascular management of CCA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Three previously healthy females aged 50, 60, and 62 underwent CCA coiling at our institution and subsequently developed ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> at 56, 28, and 14 months, respectively, post-procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At presentation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients had a new, recurrent area of flow in their CCA without changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: One patient declined further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other 2 patients, a stent was placed across the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck, and one patient underwent additional coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients remained symptomatic at their latest follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because of the intimate anatomic environment of the cavernous sinus, neural elements within it may be particularly susceptible to persistent mass or dynamic effects exacerbated by remnant or recurrent flow across the neck of a coiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These 3 cases prompted the authors to advocate for more aggressive efforts to achieve and maintain CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when such efforts are unsuccessful, consideration of traditional carotid occlusion strategies with or without bypass is warranted </plain></SENT>
