<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of any tympanoplasty is to eradicate disease and improve hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These are the primary indications for this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The success or failure of the surgery is influenced by many factors such as the age and general health of the patient, the extent and type of disease present, and whether the upper airway is functioning properly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contraindications to tympanoplasty will vary from one surgeon to another depending upon his training, philosophy, experience, and surgical skill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is helpful to think of these contraindications as being either absolute or relative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Absolute contraindications consist of: 1. uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo>; 2. <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>; 3. unusual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and/or extenuating circumstances; and 4. complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear disease</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, or lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative contraindications are less well defined: 1. eustachian tube insufficiency or non-function; 2. the uncooperative patient; 3. the dead ear; 4. the better hearing or only hearing ear; 5. the elderly patient; 6. the young child; and 7. the repeated failure case </plain></SENT>
