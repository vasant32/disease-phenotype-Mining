<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, anticoagulation therapy has been restricted to neonates without an associated parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe sequential neuroimaging findings and use of anticoagulation therapy in newborn infants with a unilateral thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten neonates with a unilateral thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was suspected using cranial ultrasound and confirmed with MRI/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight infants had a repeat MRI at 3 to 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed from 3 months until 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One infant died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven infants were treated with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No side affects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI showed involvement of multiple sinuses, additional <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, and white matter lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was present on the repeat MRI at 3 months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment was delayed in one infant and anticoagulation was started only after extension of the thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>He required a ventriculoperitoneal drain for posthemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> and developed cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> and global delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two other infants showed global delay and one of them also developed postneonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mild asymmetry in tone was present in 4 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found in 10 neonates with unilateral thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was suspected on cranial ultrasound and confirmed with MRI/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Treatment with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in newborn infants with a thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> appears to be safe and should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up will be needed to assess cognitive outcome </plain></SENT>
