<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low grade fever</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruptions</z:e>, but neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antinuclear and anti ds-DNA antibodies were positive, and complements were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI demonstrated diffuse hyperintense white matter lesions on T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledemas</z:hpo> developed in the fundi, when her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was exacerbated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 550 mmH2O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed no cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed as BIH secondary to SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since RI cisternography revealed remarkably delayed absorption of the CSF, it was speculated that the CSF absorption by arachnoid villi would be probably disturbed in association with some autoimmune mechanisms by SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The subsequent rise of intraventricular pressure may result in retrograde transependymal flow of the CSF and the diffuse hyperintense white matter lesions on MRI </plain></SENT>
