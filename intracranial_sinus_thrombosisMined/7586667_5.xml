<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both presented with a short history of periorbital pain and swelling followed rapidly by complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By the time of correct diagnosis, both cases were advanced with lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001291'>cranial nerve involvement</z:hpo>, CT evidence of ophthalmic artery and cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and, in one, internal carotid artery invasion (demonstrated on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography) with resultant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient was treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> but died within a few days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second patient had aggressive surgical resection and survived with significant residual morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026718" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucormycosis</z:e> should be excluded in any diabetic patient presenting with orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, especially when there is early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early aggressive treatment with surgery and antifungal agents is often successful whereas the outcome is almost universally fatal when the diagnosis is delayed </plain></SENT>
