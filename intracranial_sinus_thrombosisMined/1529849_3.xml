<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children, 6 months to 14 years old, with intracranial lesions or clinically suspected vascular malformations were studied prospectively with conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In nine cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic findings were verified with digital subtraction angiography or conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies were performed on a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> system using a circularly polarized head coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, performed in 24 cases, revealed congenital abnormalities of the arterial vessels in 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vessel stenosis was observed in nine patients, and displacement of intracranial arteries due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> could be seen in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven children had no abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was performed in seven children, with depiction of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The comparative analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and digital subtraction angiography showed equivalent results in nine patients; in one patient the degree of stenosis was overestimated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, when combined with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, reveals information about soft-tissue and vascular structures in a single setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At this point, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography can replace invasive conventional angiography or digital subtraction angiography only in selected cases because of software and hardware limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Arterial or venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography can be helpful as an additional scan in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations of children with suspected cerebral neurovascular diseases, and its noninvasive nature makes it well suited for routine use in children </plain></SENT>
