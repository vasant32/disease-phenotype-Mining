<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>279 patients with angiographically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into mild and severe clinical grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was divided into three phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phase I included 27 patients treated with systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase II included 72 patients, 30 in severe grade and 42 in mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>26 were thrombolysed with 14 in severe and 12 in mild grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phase III included 180 patients treated according to a defined protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>133 were in mild grade and 47 in severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>67 patients were thrombolysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the thrombolysed group 27 patients were in mild grade and 40 in severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>113 patients were treated with systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> management <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were anticoagulated for six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The baseline characteristics were found to be same in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On comparison of outcome in Phase III with Phase 1 the likelihood ratio was found to be statistically significant in favor of Phase III (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The likelihood ratio was found to be statistically significant in mild and severe clinical grade in favor of thrombolysis in Phase III (p 0.039 in mild and p 0.00001 in Severe clinical grade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This ratio was insignificant (p=0.716) for intracranial bleed; however, local puncture site <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was found to be significant in the thrombolysed group (0.00005) </plain></SENT>
