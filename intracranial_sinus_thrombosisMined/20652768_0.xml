<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The underlying mechanism for symptomatic recovery in patients with cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) is not clear, although post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> recanalization and collateral formation have been proposed as possible mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the occurrence of recanalization and collateral formation among survivors of CVST and explore its association with symptomatic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients admitted with CVST over a 5-year period and who underwent initial magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) or computed tomographic (CT) venography and a follow-up CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography between 3 and 12 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the images were reviewed by a single observer using the classification for recanalization proposed by Qureshi grade I--partial recanalization of one or more occluded dural sinus with improved flow or visualization of branches; grade II--complete recanalization of one sinus but persistent occlusion of the other sinuses [A--no residual flow, B--non occlusive flow]; grade III--complete recanalization and for collateral formation (grade I--collaterals bypass occluded segment of dural venous sinus but connect within the same sinus; grade II--collaterals bypass occluded segment but connect with a different sinus; grade III--collaterals bypass the occluded segment and connect with different circulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with CVST (mean age 34.82 [Â± 17.1 SD]; 19 were men) had an initial and follow-up venographic study performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 21 patients underwent serial venographic imaging using the same modality allowing a direct comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 patients who had recanalization during follow-up, 10 patients had grade I recanalization, 7 had grade III recanalization, and 4 had no recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collateral formation was seen in 8 patients: grade I in 3 patients, grade II in 1 patient, and grade III in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> appeared higher in those with no or partial recanalization than with complete recanalization (5 of 14 patients vs. 0 of 7 patients) and in patients with no collaterals than patients with collaterals (4 out of 13 vs. 1 out of 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients experienced any recurrence or new symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complete or partial recanalization and collateral formation are seen in a prominent proportion of patients with CVST in the months following initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to identify the temporal course and clinical significance of venographic recanalization and collateral formation, and factors influencing venographic changes </plain></SENT>
