<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging of the brain, initially computed tomography, followed by magnetic resonance venography, confirmed a diagnosis of sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with associated venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's past medical history revealed that she had suffered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and following investigation for this, had undergone a nephrectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was complicated by postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
