<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study sought to identify imaging criteria useful in discriminating anatomical variants from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the posterior intracranial venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 102 patients underwent coronal unenhanced two-dimensional time-of-flight (2D ToF) magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transverse sinus (TS) calibre and asymmetry were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oval (O-FG) and linear (L-FG) flow gaps were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several slices of the 2D ToF sequence were applied perpendicularly to the TS within each FG to avoid in-plane saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean calibre of the right TS was significantly greater than the contralateral sinus (6.5 mm+/-1.84 vs 5.1 mm+/-1.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Right and left dominance was observed in 61% and 17% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean right-left TS diameter was 5.77 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 204 TS, 44 L-FG and 42 O-FG were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Partial L-FG (&lt;2/3 of TS) never involved the distal TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No L-FG was observed in a dominant TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Supplementary sagittal 2D ToF images disclosed blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two L-FGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>O-FGs were mostly observed laterally (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: L-FGs in a dominant TS, partial L-FGs in the distal part or O-FG in the medial part of any TS, a left-right mean diameter &lt;3 mm and absence of flow even in ToF images perpendicular to the direction of blood flow should raise the suspicion of sinus pathology </plain></SENT>
