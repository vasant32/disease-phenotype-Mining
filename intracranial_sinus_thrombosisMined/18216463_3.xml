<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thereby, the dynamic visualization of cerebral vessels is enabled similar to the principle of digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet, its voxel size is relatively large due to an inherent trade-off between the desired spatial and temporal resolutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the limited spatial resolution of TR <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography (MRV) is sufficient to visualize dural venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prospective study included 20 patients without compromise of cerebral venous outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists independently graded the quality of visualization of 11 predefined dural venous sinuses on images of fast TR contrast-enhanced MRV (1.5 s/dataset; voxel size, 2 x 2 x 2.2 mm; acquisition time, 37.5 s) in comparison to time-of-flight (TOF) MRV (voxel size, 0.8 x 0.8 x 4 mm; acquisition time, 3 min 51 s) and steady-state contrast-enhanced 3D (VIBE) MRV (voxel size, 1.1 x 0.9 x 1.5 mm; acquisition time, 2 min 46 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The torcular Herophili (p &lt; 0.001), left (p &lt; 0.001) and right (p &lt; 0.01) transverse sinus, and right jugular bulb (p &lt; 0.05) were visualized better at TR MRV than at TOF MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For visualization of the small inferior sagittal sinus, TR MRV was inferior to VIBE (p &lt; 0.001) and TOF (p &lt; 0.05) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The visibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other dural sinuses was equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the inferior spatial resolution, TR MRV depicted some large dural sinuses more clearly than TOF MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To overcome the visualization of smaller venous structures, TR MRV can be applied complementarily with high-resolution steady-state contrast-enhanced MRV </plain></SENT>
