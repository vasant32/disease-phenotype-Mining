<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 23-year-old male was admitted to our clinic on August 16, 1978, because of generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>. he had complained of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> for about 7 days before admission, and on admission he was in slightly drowsy state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At that time, bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choked discs</z:e> and bilateral abducens pareses were found without any other neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan on his 1st hospital day revealed only slight compression of the ventricular system without any midline shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the 2nd hospital day, he developed sudden left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, but his level of consciousness did not deteriorate as that of the previous day, demonstrating clear CSF by lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Right CAG on August 21 revealed delayed circulation, poor-filling of the cortical veins, and narrow superior sagittal sinus showing zigzag shaped margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scan on August 22 showed multiple irregular high dense foci mainly in both parietal lobes and the shift to the left of the ventricular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides, on enhanced CT scan, the so-called "empty triangle" sign was revealed with gyral enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although an increase of the shift of the ventricular system was demonstrated by the follow-up CT scans, he gradually improved and external decompression was necessitated no longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He was discharged with slight <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the left upper limb after superior sagittal sinus showing good-filling on right CAG performed on September 27 and had been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result, it was confirmed that in case sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is doubted, follow-up study by CT scan would be significant for the choice of treatments as well as for its diagnosis at its each stage </plain></SENT>
