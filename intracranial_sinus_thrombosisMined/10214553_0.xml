<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>25 patients are presented, who were diagnosed with cerebral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> by a combination of Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and conventional Spin-Echo sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An angiography in DSA technique was carried out additionally in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 24 patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiographic control examinations were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven cases MRA revealed an isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) whereas in eleven patients there was an additional occlusion of other sinuses or cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transverse sinus (ST) was the second most affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DSA essentially confirmed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite anticoagulation follow up MRA's showed complete recanalisation in only 7 patients, in 8 cases partial recanalisation was observed and in 9 cases a complete occlusion persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to these findings neurological examinations during the follow up period were unremarkable in 16 patients and the remainder revealed only mild residual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general no further morphological alterations of the cerebral sinus system were detectable by MRA after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow up imaging beyond 6 months therefore appears unnecessary, unless a relapse is suspected </plain></SENT>
