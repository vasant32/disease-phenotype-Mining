<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sinus was thrombosed proximal and distal to the dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> with the venous drainage being retrograde through cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ipsilateral percutaneous transjugular approach was used in both cases and allowed recanalization of the thrombosed sinus and embolization of the dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> with coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete cure was achieved in one patient and 95% reduction in arteriovenous shunting including elimination of the cortical venous reflux in the other </plain></SENT>
