<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Multi-detector computer tomography angiography (CTA) provides a fast non-invasive assessment of the cerebral vessels, is readily available in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting and can potentially replace invasive digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the diagnosis of intracranial vascular lesions in an emergency setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience in the use of emergent cerebral CTA versus DSA in the assessment of patients presenting acutely with symptoms suspicious of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients presenting acutely with clinical suspicion of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture were evaluated over a 4-month period from January to April 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CTA with peripheral intravenous contrast injection was performed on a 32 slice helical scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DSA was performed within 48 hours for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases when CTA was the initial assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies were assessed via radiology reports using DSA or surgery as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except for 3 patients had CTA as the initial study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> detected by CTA in these 37 patients, with 9 negative studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>), 1 with AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (AVF), 1 tumoral bleed, 2 vertebral dissections, and 1 missed sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVT) on CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based solely on CTA assessment, 3 patients had direct surgical clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, while 4 proceeded to direct endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Emergent CTA is a non-invasive, reliable and viable alternative to emergent DSA for the assessment of the cerebral vessels in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> assessment of patients presenting with symptoms suspicious of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Where positive, it can serve as a guide to therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Review of CTA source data is essential, especially for small lesions and for post-clipping assessment </plain></SENT>
