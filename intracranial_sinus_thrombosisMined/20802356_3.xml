<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Parasagittal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> invading the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) pose formidable obstacles to surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Invasion is often considered a contraindication to surgery because of associated morbidity, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report our most recent experience with the resection of parasagittal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> invading the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1992 and 2004, 110 patients with parasagittal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> underwent surgery at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical charts, radiological studies, pathological features, and operative notes were retrospectively analyzed; only those patients with minimum 24 months follow-up (n = 61) were further studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> distribution by location along the SSS was: 21% anterior, 62% middle, and 17% posterior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were managed with initial surgical resection with radiosurgery for residual/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> if indicated (19.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination revealed 80% grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, 13% grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, and 7% grade III <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simpson grade I/II resection was achieved in 81% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>/infarction (7%), intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (1.5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1.5%); long-term outcomes assessed included recurrence (11%) and improvement in Karnofsky Performance Score (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of our study, the incidence of postoperative venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is 7% in the setting of a recurrence rate of 11% with a mean follow-up of 41 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the published literature, the data corroborate the rationale for our treatment paradigm; lesions invading the sinus can initially be resected to the greatest extent possible without excessive manipulation of vascular structures, whereas residual/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> can be observed and managed with radiosurgery </plain></SENT>
