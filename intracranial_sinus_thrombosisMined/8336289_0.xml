<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is essential to a favorable outcome that clinicians maintain a high index of suspicion in relation to physical complaints of puerperal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Meticulous, comprehensive, multisystem assessment is indicated to explore fully the presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, or other subjective data when discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> can easily be attributed to a multitude of factors associated with birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, stress, complications of anesthesia, fluid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalances</z:e>, and muscle tension and strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is imperative that clinicians not assume a benign etiology for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Careful documentation of findings as well as open, ongoing communication with members of the clinical team will best serve the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of vague complaints and subtle clinical findings frequently forms the basis for diagnosis of SSSVT and for clinical management to follow </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For this reason, identifying fulminant processes is an increasingly significant role of the perinatal nurse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Data collected in routine assessments and then verified and aggregated by the members of the health care team will be critical to prevent a rise in morbidity and mortality in the early days following discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In a more hopeful tone, detecting and resolving complications will help to set up the newly established family for a positive start </plain></SENT>
