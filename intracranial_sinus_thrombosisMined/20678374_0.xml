<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of interventional neuroradiologic techniques has enabled infusion of thrombolytics at the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a woman with a cerebral haemorrhage due to a thrombosed superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her decreased level of consciousness and increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> prompted direct thrombolytic therapy (urokinase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow was restored in the occluded sinus, but an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> expansion of the haematoma an hour after conclusion of the infusion resulted in temporary worsening of her neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the ultimate outcome was satisfactory, the possibility of further <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> must be balanced against the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with conservative therapy </plain></SENT>
