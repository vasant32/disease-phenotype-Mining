<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Intracranial complications as a result of otogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> occur even in the antibiotic era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>Meningitis</z:hpo> is the most common reported intracranial complication, followed by brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to review our experience and management of these serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed at a tertiary referral medical center for the period from 1998 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Charts with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> as primary diagnosis were reviewed, and intracranial complications secondary to either were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, clinical presentation, radiographic findings, management, and outcome were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> or petrous apicitis were not included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten cases reviewed had intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain abscesses</z:e>, 1 patient had a subdural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath>, and 4 patients had lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were treated with direct drainage of the intracranial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, especially if clinical and serial radiographic response was favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Otogenic intracranial complications can be fatal if not managed appropriately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for 6 weeks is usually sufficient treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Management of the intracranial disease takes precedence, but direct drainage of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> may not be necessary if a patient's symptoms, neurologic status, and radiographic findings progress favorably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A high index of suspicion should be maintained on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presenting with symptoms not typically seen with routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
