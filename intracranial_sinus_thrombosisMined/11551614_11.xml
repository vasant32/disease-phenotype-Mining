<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The clinical picture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo>, sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> has changed with the advent of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A delay in the recognition of intracranial complications in children and in the institution of appropriate therapy may result in morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased mortality of the children has been correlated with the neurological status of the patient on admission to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective study was made of two children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> and sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> with cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> treated in 1997 in the ENT Department of the Medical University of Gdansk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We present two cases of intracranial complications in children (13 and 11 years old) originating from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first case, of a 13-year-old boy with sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> took its course as a typical Symonds Syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy, thrombectomy and jugular vein ligation associated with antibiotics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>-reducing drugs and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> proved to be successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second case of an 11-year-old boy with exacerbated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo>, was complicated by suppurative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, perisinual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and sigmoid sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgical approach by suboccipital craniotomy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> drainage was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Otological treatments of modified radical mastoidectomy, thrombectomy, jugular vein ligation, perisinual and cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> drainage associated with wide-spectrum antibiotics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>-reducing drugs were performed with a very good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 3 years of follow-up the patients remain without any neurological and psychiatric consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors show different courses of both presented complications and imaging techniques and surgical procedures performed in these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sigmoid sinus trombosis with Symonds Syndrome may be difficult to diagnose due to previous antibiotics valuable in establishing the diagnosis and the extent of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The successful therapy is based on understanding of pathogenesis of the intracranial complication and the cooperation of an otolaryngologist, a neurologist, a neurosurgeon and an ophthalmologist </plain></SENT>
