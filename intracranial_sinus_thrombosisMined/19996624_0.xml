<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report the success of anticoagulation (AC) treatment in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in view of the limited evidence seen in the literature supporting such a treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 38-year-old lady with CVT and SAH presented 12 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AC with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was started 4 days later, when the repeated brain CT showed regression of the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was changed to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, and she was asymptomatic over a 12-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In a limited number of small studies, AC has been found to be beneficial for cases of CVT with hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proper time to start AC in such cases was not clearly defined, and a delay of 4-33 days was observed after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) in general, active <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is usually confined to the first 6 h, and chances of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> enlargement are higher in the first 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it has been advised to rule out a coincidental vascular malformation and to radiologically confirm regression (or at least non-progression) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> before starting AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AC for cases of CVT may remain beneficial in the presence of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time to start AC for CVT with hemorrhagic complications is unclear; however, AC was successful when given 4 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in our case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may be wise to repeat CT after at least 24 h from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms (to confirm regression or at least non-progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) before starting AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may also be prudent to perform magnetic resonance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography to rule out a coincidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> before AC </plain></SENT>
