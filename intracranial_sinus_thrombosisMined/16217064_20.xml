<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether TS stenosis changed after normalization of CSF pressure in patients with IIH during medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients with IIH with bilateral TS stenosis on cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography (MRV) during the medical treatment were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, patients underwent repeated lumbar punctures (LPs) and cerebral MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRV was always performed before each LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TS stenosis persisted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 9 of 14 (64%) patients with IIH, CSF pressure normalized during medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transverse sinus (TS) stenoses, as revealed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography, persist in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after normalization of CSF pressure, suggesting the lack of a direct relationship between the caliber of TS and CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
