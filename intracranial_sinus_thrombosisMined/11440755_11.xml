<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a difficulty with the discrimination between mirror images more selective than has been previously reported (Turnbull OH, McCarthy RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>Failure to discriminate between mirror-image objects: a case of viewpoint-independent object recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurocase 1996;2:63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FIM was asked to judge, in five same/different experiments, whether pairs of simultaneously presented line drawings of objects were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FIM demonstrated only a minor impairment in discriminating between orientations in the picture plane but was at chance in making discrimination between mirror images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An experiment with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> observers established that our results were not due to differences in task difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two further experiments investigated the effects of rotation on the discrimination of letters and geometric shapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FIM's impairment extended to geometric shapes but not to letters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results would be consistent with the preservation of an abstract representation for object recognition that did not code the difference between mirror image views </plain></SENT>
