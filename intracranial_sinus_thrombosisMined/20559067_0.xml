<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report a rare case of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus associated with a parafalcine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> resulting in a superior sagittal sinus dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (dAVF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conclude that dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a significant predisposing factor for development of a dAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man had a left parietal parafalcine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> that invaded the posterior third of his superior sagittal sinus, leading to its occlusion and presumably resulting in an associated dAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was fed by the middle meningeal and superficial temporal arteries on both sides and drained through a superior interhemispheric cortical vein into the vein of Galen and straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION AND TECHNIQUE: The parafalcine mass, which involved the sagittal sinus, was excised via a left parieto-occipital craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was decided to resect the dAVF at a later date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the original operation, the patient underwent a parietal interhemispheric approach for occlusion of the dAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dissection proceeded until a large arterialized vein and venous pouch with multiple feeders from both external carotid arteries were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vein, which was partially embedded within the falx cerebri, was collapsed, and a second <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> injection confirmed cessation of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report supports that dAVFs are acquired lesions and that venousoutflow obstruction is a significant contributing factor to their development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> associated with the dural sinuses, diagnostic evaluation for possible dAVFs should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these lesions should be based on risk factors because spontaneous resolution after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> excision has been reported </plain></SENT>
