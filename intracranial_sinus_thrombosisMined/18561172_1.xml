<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Central venous catheter (CVC) blockage is a common complication in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether inherited thrombophilic factors may predispose Chinese children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> to CVC blockage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Newly diagnosed patients with CVC inserted were recruited during a 30-month period and prospectively followed until CVC removal, end of treatment or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein C (PC), protein S (PS), anti-thrombin III (AT-III), Factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin 20210 variant (p20210), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism (C677T), were studied with other acquired factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was CVC blockage and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (TE) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Thirty-six patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CVC blockage was found in 3/36 (8.3%) and the incidence was 0.23 per 1,000 catheter-days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 3 with CVC blockage, 2 were heterozygous for MTHFR polymorphism and 1 was heterozygous for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One with ALL developed superior saggital sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> while on asparaginase and he was heterozygous for MTHFR polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One ALL patient with combined heterozygous MTHFR polymorphism, PC and PS deficiency did not develop any CVC blockage during a median follow-up of 3.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AT-III deficiency, FVL and p20210 were not found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared to previous studies, our cohort had a much lower incidence of CVC blockage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A different pattern of inherited thrombophilic factors was found with heterozygous MTHFR polymorphism being the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We concluded that inherited thrombophilic factors alone were not associated with CVC blockage in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric cancer</z:e> patient population </plain></SENT>
