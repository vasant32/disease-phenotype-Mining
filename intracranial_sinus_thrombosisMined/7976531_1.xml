<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism involved in the relative preservation of the subcortical U-fibers in the arcuate zone was studied in a post <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after sagittal superior sinus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Superior sagittal sinus (SSS) of 36 mongrel cats were occluded by polymer injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately before the occlusion Evans-blue (EB) was administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cats were killed 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 72 and 120 hours after sinus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 20 cats in which cortical veins were occluded, in addition to the SSS, EB was extravasated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 9 of these cats, which had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, EB-staining was present only in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 11 cats with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, massive EB extravasation was observed also in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The U-fiber layer was free of EB, suggesting that the extension of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was blocked by this zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrated that the U-fibers act not only as a resistance against extension of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> from white to gray matter, but also in a reverse direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the spread of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> is not yet completely understood; both anatomical and biochemical peculiarities from its basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Different morphological patterns in the astrocytic reaction as well as the U-fibers sector vascularization are important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of each one of these factors in the preservation of subcortical U-fiber layer in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> further investigations should be done </plain></SENT>
