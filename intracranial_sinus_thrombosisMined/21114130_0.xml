<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The present retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on patients diagnosed with cerebral vein or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> based on the patients' clinical presentation and the findings of the imaging studies between 2003 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were studied for possible risk factors and the resultant outcome after terminating the therapeutic course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo>, the most common symptom reported in 80% of the cases, was considered the first symptom in only 46% of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo>, focal motor deficit at presentation, hemorrhagic conversion of infarction and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in more than one sinus were factors associated with unfavorable outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Physicians should always have CVT in mind while examining patients particularly women on pills who complain about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More studies however are needed to point out more specific presentations which would lead to the early diagnosis of CVT in the patients </plain></SENT>
