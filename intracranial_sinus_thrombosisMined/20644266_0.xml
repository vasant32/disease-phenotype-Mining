<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) is one of the common causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality in CVST, in addition to progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, is related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of decompressive surgery in CVST is not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We report our experience with decompressive surgery in CVST and review the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a retrospective study carried out in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit of a multispeciality tertiary care hospital in south India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients admitted with the diagnosis of CVST between December 2003 and July 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation, etiology, medical management, indications for surgery and outcomes were assessed for patients undergoing decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensorium was assessed using the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS), while the outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics were used as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and six patients were admitted with the diagnosis of CVST during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (10%) underwent decompressive surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery included a low GCS at admission with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the computed tomography scan, mass effect and midline shift, clinical and radiological signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e>, deterioration in the sensorium in spite of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> measures and postthrombolysis <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (73%) had a good outcome while three patients (27%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who died, two had a low GCS and bilaterally nonreactive pupils before the surgery while one had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decompressive surgery for patients with large cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is a life-saving procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with CVST who develop clinical and radiological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> either at presentation or during the course of medical management may benefit from decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
