<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The values of outflow resistance and volume-pressure response increased also and remained significantly unchanged with only slight decrease of the volume-pressure response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The morphometric study of the surface veins showed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the veins draining to the occluded saggital sinus for about 10-20% </plain></SENT>
