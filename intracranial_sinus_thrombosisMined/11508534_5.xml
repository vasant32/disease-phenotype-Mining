<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method of CSF shunting utilizes the impact pressure (IP) of the bloodstream in the SSS to maintain the intraventricular pressure (IVP) more than the sinus pressure (SP) regardless of changes in posture or intrathoracic pressure (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) and discourages stagnation and clotting of blood at the venous end of the connection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It also utilizes collapse of the internal jugular vein (IJV) in the erect posture to prevent siphonage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the past 8 years, 50 RVS shunts were successfully implanted using valveless shunting catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no problems related to incorrect CSF drainage or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated arrest of the hydrocephalic process, normalization of the IVP and proper shunt function </plain></SENT>
