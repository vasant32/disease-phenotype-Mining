<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its management remains a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to study the role of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic outcome of 150 patients of puerperal CVT manifesting within one month of delivery or abortion, was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was supported by cranial computed tomography and/or angiography whenever required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy three patients, 46 with non-haemorrhagic infarction and 27 with haemorrhagic infarction, received 2500 units of subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, three times a day within 24 hours of hospitalization till 30th post partum day or symptomatic relief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy seven patients during the same period, 50 with non-haemorrhagic infarction and 27 with haemorrhagic infarction, who did not receive <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> formed the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeat CT scans were done when indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group, 34 patients made full recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> among the patients with haemorrhagic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In control group, only 14 patients recovered completely (P=&lt;0.001) and 18 died (P=&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Low dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is safe and efficacious in puerperal CVT, even in patients with haemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
