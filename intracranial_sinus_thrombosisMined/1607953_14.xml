<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is supposed that progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from the sinus into bridging and cortical veins plays a key role in the development of these pathophysiological changes, but this hypothesis lacks experimental proof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study, using a novel animal model of sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, was to evaluate the effects of a standardized occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus and its bridging and cortical veins on hemodynamic alterations, on brain water content, and on ICP in domestic pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 animals, the middle third of the superior sagittal sinus was occluded with a catheter-guided balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of these pigs received an additional injection of 1 ml fibrin glue into the superior sagittal sinus anterior to the inflated balloon, leading to an obstruction of bridging and cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five control animals the balloon was inserted but not inflated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five pigs underwent cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four hours after occlusion, the brains were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and coronal slices were examined for Evans blue dye extravasation, regional water content, and histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus alone did not affect ICP or cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The additional injection of fibrin glue caused an obstruction of cortical and bridging veins as well as severe increases in mean (+/- standard deviation) ICP to 49.4 +/- 14.3 mm Hg, compared with 8.3 +/- 4.5 mm Hg in sham-treated controls and 7.1 +/- 3.9 mm Hg in animals with occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was also a steep fall in the mean CPP to 34.2 +/- 19.6 mm Hg compared with 96.4 +/- 13.8 mm Hg in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>White-matter water content anterior to the occlusion site was elevated to 81.9 +/- 3.7 gm/100 gm frozen weight in the fibrin group as compared to 70.7 +/- 2.2 gm/100 gm in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Posterior to the occlusion site, water content did not differ among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated collateral flow via cortical and bridging veins in animals with occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additional fibrin glue obstructed these collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The data suggest a multistep process of pathophysiological alterations in patients with sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and may explain why these patients present with a wide variety of symptoms: minor neurological deficits or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> might indicate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus and/or its bridging veins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
