<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 54 year old woman presented with symptoms resulting from a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the lateral transverse and sagittal sinuses the day after an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) replacement treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had previously suffered a milder episode after IVIg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infections</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> for more than 40 years, a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">IgG1 deficiency</z:e> had been made two years earlier, after exclusion of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She made a good recovery from the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but high platelet counts were investigated and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocythaemia</z:e> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigation of humoral immunity revealed protective amounts of IgG antibodies to pathogens, and because the previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">IgG1 deficiency</z:e> had resolved IVIg infusions were not restarted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She made a good response to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi>, with improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and lowering of the platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic antibiotics reduced the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infections</z:e> and nasal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> improved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011109'>chronic sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case is presented to highlight the need to look for other contributing factors for severe recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> after IVIg treatment, and to consider the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> even when replacement doses of IVIg are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is also important to emphasise the need to ensure that an isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162539" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">IgG subclass deficiency</z:e> is not transient; that failure to produce specific IgG antibodies to immunisation and/or exposure antigens is confirmed, thus meeting the criteria for the diagnosis of primary antibody deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A thorough risk-benefit assessment is essential before blood product treatment is started </plain></SENT>
