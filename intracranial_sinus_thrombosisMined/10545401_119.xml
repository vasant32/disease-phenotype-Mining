<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those patients without any evidence of objective neurological involvement as well as the patients with other possible explanations for the neurological picture, and cases not fulfilling the criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 200 cases (155 male, 45 female) were evaluated: 162 had parenchymal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement (brainstem or 'brainstem +' involvement in 51%, spinal cord involvement in 14%, hemispheric involvement in 15% and isolated pyramidal signs in 19%) while 38 had secondary or non-parenchymal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first group the most common findings were pyramidal signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, behavioural changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002839'>sphincter disturbance</z:hpo>, whereas in the second group the syndrome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> due to dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was the main clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 60% of the cases with parenchymal involvement, CSF was hypercellular and/or had an elevated protein level, whereas in cases with non-parenchymal involvement the CSF was usually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> except for the elevated pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In more than half of the patients with parenchymal involvement, MRI showed brainstem and/or basal ganglion lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-one per cent of the cases had a course with at least one attack and remission, another 28% also had attack(s) but showed secondary progression, 10% had primary progression and 21% had silent neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed in patients who had at least a 3-year duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal involvement, elevated protein and/or pleocytosis in the CSF, 'brainstem +' type involvement, primary or secondary progressive course and relapse during steroid tapering were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
