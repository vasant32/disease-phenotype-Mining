<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted as a part of the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated predictors of outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> patients who had an "early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>," ie, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> already present at time of diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> by a logistic regression analysis, with a modified Rankin scale 3 to 6 at month 6 as dependent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same analysis was performed with "delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>," ie, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> that occurred after the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, as dependent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 624 patients recruited in International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp>, 245 (39%) had an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>: at month 6, 51 (21%) of them had a modified Rankin Scale 3 to 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of having modified Rankin scale 3 to 6 at month 6 were older age (adjusted odds ratio for 1-year increase in age, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.08); male gender (adjusted odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.29 to 8.16); having a deep cerebral venous system <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (adjusted odds ratio, 5.43; 95% CI, 1.67 to 17.61) or a right lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (adjusted odds ratio, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.03 to 6.40); and having a motor deficit (adjusted odds ratio, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.21 to 7.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 patients who had a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, those who had a modified Rankin scale 3 to 6 at month 6 were less likely to have received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, and more likely to have had early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, those who were older, men, had a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep cerebral venous system or of the right lateral sinus, and a motor deficit were at higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency at month 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This subgroup of patients with predictors of poor outcome can be the target for new therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
