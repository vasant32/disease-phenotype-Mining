<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pathophysiology of sinus vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) is still controversial in patients and experimental animals, the microcirculatory alterations in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to develop a new sinus vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model and to further elucidate pathophysiological events such as the relationship between local and regional cerebral blood flow and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> oxygen saturation (HbSO2), changes of the microvasculature, leukocyte behaviour and brain tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a first experimental series, animals were divided into two groups which resulted from different procedures of inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the SSS middle occlusion group (SMO group), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> was induced by the ligation of the superior sagittal sinus right in the middle between the bregma and the confluence sinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the SSS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior occlusion</z:e> group (SPO group) the ligation was performed close to the confluence sinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed at 36 identical locations by laser Doppler flowmetry together with regional <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> oxygen saturation (HbSO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second series of experiments <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> was induced by ligation of the SSS close to the confluence sinum (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> group) to study effects on the cortical microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A sham operation was performed in six animals (sham group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both groups, an intravital microscopic double tracing technique was utilised for evaluating microvessel structures and leukocyte behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The images were recorded on videotape for evaluating alterations of microvessel (venules, arterioles and capillaries) diameters and numbers of leukocyte rollers and stickers by a digital video analyser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed for histological evaluation after 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The posterior sinus ligation caused a significant decrease of rCBF and HbSO2 and brain tissue damage which was not seen in the SMO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alteration of rCBF and HbSO2 were positively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in the SPO group only, where venous infarction was easily reproduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is suggested that this model is suitable for studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in Mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intravital microscopy of the cortical microcirculation revealed no significant changes of vessels diameter in the sham group, whereas a significant dilation of veins and capillaries was seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Numbers of leukocyte rollers and stickers were positively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microcirculatory alterations and brain tissue damage from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in the Mongolian gerbil depend on the SSS occlusion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The newly established mongolian gerbil sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model has advantages compared to previously reported sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models such as easy handling, easy technique, highly reproducibility, and good observation of microcirculatory event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The model allows for studies of cerebral low-flow conditions such as expected to occur in an ischaemic penumbra zone </plain></SENT>
