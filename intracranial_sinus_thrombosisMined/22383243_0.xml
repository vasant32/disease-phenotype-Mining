<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients with cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> recover after treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, but a subgroup of severe cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those patients may benefit from intrasinus thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this research was to carry out a retrospective analysis of patients with severe cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and to study the safety and efficacy of intrasinus thrombolysis in patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> unresponsive to conventional <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> who received intrasinus thrombolysis during a 3-year period (January 2007 to December 2009) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urokinase was infused into the sinus via a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data regarding demographic, clinical, and radiologic features were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were obtained at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRV was repeated to assess the recanalization of the venous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (73%) had good outcome and 7 patients (19%) who were independent for activities of daily life had only mild deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient survived with severe neurologic deficits and 2 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization of the superior sagittal sinus was seen in 35 patients (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At a follow-up of 6 months, 34 patients (92%) were either asymptomatic or had only minor subjective symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intrasinus thrombolysis is safe and effective in patients with severe cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the subgroup of patients that is likely to benefit the most from this procedure is not clear from our data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Large randomized controlled trials are required to further clarify this issue </plain></SENT>
