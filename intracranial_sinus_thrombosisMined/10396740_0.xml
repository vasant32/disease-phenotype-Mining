<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> and he was admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed a fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the right transverse sinus and angiography revealed the occlusion of the right transverse-sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> again and he was re-admitted to our hospital 4 months after the first admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed a dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (DAVF) of the right transverse-sigmoid sinus fed by the right occipital artery and the right transverse-sigmoid sinus was found to be recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The angiography which was carried out one year after the second admission, revealed also an enlarged DAVF fed by the left occipital artery and the right transverse sinus was occluded again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are two theories about the pathogenesis of DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One is that it is congenital and the other that it is acquired, but it is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our case suggested that sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induced DAVF initially and the DAVF induced sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> secondarily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The causal relations between DAVF and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> probably changed inversely over a long term and, when we discuss the pathogenesis of DAVF, we must understand the natural history of DAVF starting from the occurrence of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
