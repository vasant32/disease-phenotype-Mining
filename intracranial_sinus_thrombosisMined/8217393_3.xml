<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients ranged in age from 36 to 73 years old with a mean of 57 years and included 2 males and 3 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and bruit, one with atypical facial pain, and one with parietal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had a history of hemorrhagic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DAVFs were located at transverse-sigmoid sinus (3 cases), superior petrosal sinus (1 case), and straight sinus (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were fed by many branches of external carotid artery including middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, posterior auricular artery, occipital artery, meningeal branches of vertebral artery and posterior cerebral artery, and meningohypophyseal trunk of internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shunt flow drained into contralateral transverse-sigmoid or supratentorial sinuses via the isolated venous segment through markedly dilated cortical and/or deep venous systems, which caused altered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venous drainage pattern and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transarterial embolization in multiple stages (mean 3.4) using n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) could alleviate symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DAVFs were almost totally obliterated in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further embolization in one case, and surgical excision in one case were planed because of some residual dilated cortical venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Posterior fossa DAVFs with isolated sinus segment accompany markedly dilated cortical and/or deep venous systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They could cause cerebellar, brainstem, or cranial nerve dysfunctions, and sometimes present distant supratentorial symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> due to abnormal venous drainage and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
