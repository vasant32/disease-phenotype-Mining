<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the controversial issue of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and indications for surgery in association with severe sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the last 4 years, we have treated three patients with severe sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients received systemic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and, after experiencing neurological deterioration, underwent open thrombectomy and local thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the operation, aggressive intensive care was given and included cerebral perfusion monitoring, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> administration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, and osmotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment was guided by repeated neuroradiological investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients returned to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracranial sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, even in the worst neurological state, should be treated aggressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cornerstone in treatment is systemic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and repeated neuroradiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When, despite adequate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and intensive care, neurological deterioration occurs, a combination of open thrombectomy and local thrombolytic therapy should be considered </plain></SENT>
