<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin G20210A variant is reported to be the second most frequent prothrombotic polymorphism in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the prevalence of this variant in south Indian women and examine its association with cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurring during puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated 96 women with puerperal cerebral veno-sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVT) and 103 age-matched women with no post-partum complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to identify their genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prothrombin G20210A variant was not detected in either the CVT patients or the healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study on a large series of patients with puerperal CVT shows that the prothrombin G20210A variant is not present in south Indian women and is not associated with puerperal CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study also highlights the fact that there are racial differences in the risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which should be considered when investigating these patients </plain></SENT>
