<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is increasingly recognized as a much more frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> than was anticipated before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the pathophysiology of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (SSST) from 19 patients and a rat SSST model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated 19 cases with SSST who were diagnosed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The symptoms of nine patients, who suffered multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, were abrupt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another ten patients who recovered satisfactorily, the condition progressed slowly and they were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that female, sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt;24 hours) and posterior 1/3 occlusion are related to bad outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experimentally, SSST was induced by ligation and slow injection of kaolin-cephalin suspension into SSS in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> oxygen saturation (Hb Sao(2)) using a "scanning" technique were measured at 48 locations, and fluorescence angiography was performed before and until 90 min after SSST induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours the animals were sacrificed for histological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decrease of rCBF and tissue Hb SO(2) and brain damage were seen in group B (n = 10) with an extension of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from SSS into cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain injury was not observed in group A (n = 8) with SSS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> alone and sham-operated animals (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a brain with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> extension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from SSS into cortical veins becomes critical for cerebral blood supply and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CBF, tissue HbSO(2) and repeated angiography can be helpful monitors for the early detection of critical conditions after SSST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As to the therapy, restraint on the ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is essential to protect the brain with SSST, and we encourage the use of combination therapy of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and urokinase as early as possible in cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
