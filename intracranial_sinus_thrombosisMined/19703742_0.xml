<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important for emergency physicians to be aware of the classic and most common risk factors leading to this illness, including genetic and acquired prothrombotic states, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, inflammatory conditions, and certain drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this article are to discuss a case of CVST and describe the signs and symptoms of CVST as well as the radiologic modalities used to diagnose this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, we will discuss the causes and risk factors that lead to this potentially devastating diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old girl was found unconscious and without pulses in an apparent drug overdose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emergency Medical Services responders and Emergency Department personnel resuscitated the patient to a return of spontaneous circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As part of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> work-up, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head was performed and showed a cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was thought to be due to the drug overdose and the low-flow state that occurred during loss of circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After anticoagulation therapy and antibiotic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, the patient had a full recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rapid diagnosis of CVST was essential to the appropriate care of this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Being aware of signs, symptoms, and risk factors leading to CVST will assist the emergency physician in making this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
