<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate possible relationships between the asymmetry of transverse sinuses in TOF <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and intraocular pressures of right and left eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, subjects were 63 male and 42 female medical school students, aged 18-21 years (mean+/-SD; 19.72+/-0.67 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with neurological and ophthalmologic disease, particularly dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>, trauma and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, were excluded the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into five groups according to the magnitudes of the right- and left-transverse sinuses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is a functional relation between intraocular pressures of the right and left eyes and asymmetry of the transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the transverse sinus on one side is larger and its venous drainage is greater, the intraocular pressure of the eye on this side is lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It can be speculated that the transverse sinus size may be associated with pathogenesis of diseases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007906'>increased intraocular pressure</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine the relation between the size and drainage of transverse sinuses in TOF <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in our next study </plain></SENT>
