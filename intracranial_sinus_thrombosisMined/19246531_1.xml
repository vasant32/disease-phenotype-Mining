<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Meningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334121" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="IMT">inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) has been rarely reported, and its prognosis is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to describe the imaging features of patients with meningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and their results on follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in 10 consecutive patients with pathologically proved meningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMTs</z:e> were retrospectively evaluated, focusing on the lesion distribution, signal intensity (SI), and contrast-enhancement pattern with a review of the clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> showed localized (n = 4) or diffuse (n = 4) dural thickening, a single mass (n = 5) or 2 (n = 2) dural-based masses with surrounding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 5), and leptomeningeal involvement (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracranial involvement of the mastoid (n = 2) and orbit (n = 2) was also associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of the 2 patients with intraspinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> showed a dural-based mass and a segmental dural thickening, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the thickened dura showed low SI on T2-weighted images, iso-SI on T1-weighted images, and diffuse contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variable recurrences with dural-based masses, mastoid involvement, or nasolacrimal duct involvement were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients with diffuse intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, but not in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Localized or diffuse dural thickening of T2 low SI and diffuse contrast enhancement combined with dural-based masses are a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging finding of meningeal intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjacent leptomeningeal involvement and dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are frequently associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diffuse type has a tendency toward recurrence </plain></SENT>
