<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients were examined with bone subtraction CT angiography (BSCTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were acquired on 4-and 64-slice spiral CT systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The post-processing method is based on fully automatic registration of non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced CT data and subsequent selective bone removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular structures and brain tissue are retained with the original CTA noise level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Image quality and delineation of the pathologic process were assessed and artifacts introduced by the bone removal process recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bone subtraction algorithm worked successfully in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The processing time was 6 min on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Image quality was rated excellent in 20 (39%), good in 26 (51%) and acceptable in 5 (10%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmic arteries were visible in 12 (24%) patients bilaterally, in 13 (25%) patients unilaterally and in 26 (51%) patients at least at the origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BSCTA improved visualization of the infraclinoid ICA and the vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The depiction of stenosis of the extracranial ICA and supraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was not significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with suspicion of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, BSCTA and conventional CTA yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To conclude, BSCTA improves the visualization of vessels with close contact to bone and can improve the diagnostic accuracy and therapy planning of infraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
