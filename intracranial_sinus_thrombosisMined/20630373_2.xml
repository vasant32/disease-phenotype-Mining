<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) is a life-threatening condition that may present with symptoms and signs identical to idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both conditions consist of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP); however, IIH shows no evidence of contributory intracranial pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral hormonally based contraceptive usage has been associated with both conditions as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> often occurs in CVST, and IIH and is evident in other sight- and life-threatening conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial mass</z:e> lesions, neuroimaging and other ancillary testing must be conducted for definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE: An 18-year-old white woman with IIH previously diagnosed presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the left eye (O.S.) was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Threshold perimetry found bilaterally <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enlarged blind spots</z:e> as well as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000603'>central scotoma</z:hpo> O.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her medical history was significant for a right transverse, sigmoid and jugular siphon <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> secondary to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> and associated with her use of oral birth control medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequent magnetic resonance venography (MRV) found the presence of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite anticoagulation therapy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, she had severe, nonresolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>She recovered full visual fields and excellent visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because of the similarity in clinical presentation of CVST and IIH, it is important to differentiate distinguishing characteristics of these diseases for correct diagnosis and prompt treatment </plain></SENT>
