<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are still a portion of cases with unknown reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between internal jugular vein (IJV) abnormalities and the development of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 51 CVST patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter, the maximum velocity (Vmax) and the reflux time in bilateral IJVs were measured by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The paired t test was used to compare the numeric values between the bilateral IJVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Pearson chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between IJV abnormality and CVST, IJV abnormality and IJV reflux, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 51 CVST patients, 20 (39%) patients were with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IJV and 31 (61%) patients were with abnormal IJV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The types of IJV abnormality included annulus stenosis 19 cases (61%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> 9 cases (29%), <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 2 cases (7%) and anomalous valve 1 case (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with unilateral IJV abnormality, the minimum diameter of the IJV on the lesion side was significantly smaller than that of the contralateral side (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When compared with contralateral side, the Vmax of the lesion side with unilateral annulus stenosis was significant higher, however, it was obvious lower in patients with unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, among 27 cases with unilateral IJV abnormality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the CVST occurred on the same side as the IJV lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IJV abnormality closely correlated with the development of CVST, which is a newly identified risk factor for CVST </plain></SENT>
