<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the spectrum of neuroradiologic findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) and to compare findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and non-SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 110 patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> who underwent CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, of whom 59 (54%) had abnormal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 59 patients, abnormalities were categorized as large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, hyperintense white matter foci on T2-weighted images, or dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter foci were designated as small (&lt; 5mm) or large (&gt; 5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were the most common abnormality, seen in 24 of 110 (22%) patients, followed in frequency by hyperintense white matter foci, seen in 19 of 110 (17%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent of patients with hyperintense white matter foci had at least one large lesion, and 76% had five or more small foci, three or more large foci, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were seen in 11 of 110 (10%) and 10 of 110 (9%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was seen in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of abnormalities was high in both the SLE (57%) and the non-SLE (41%) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in the non-SLE group (26%) than in the SLE group (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although hyperintense white matter foci and cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in SLE patients, the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> of various sizes and hyperintense white matter foci are the most common abnormalities seen on CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found no significant differences in frequencies of abnormalities seen between non-SLE and SLE patients </plain></SENT>
