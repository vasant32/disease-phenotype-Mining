<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) is still considered a severe clinical problem that is difficult to diagnose and manage and is linked to a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, conventional cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or more recently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography allow a more rapid and precise diagnosis, and prognosis has improved with the use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report 23 cases of CVST consecutively admitted to the Institute of Neurology of the University of Parma during the period 1990-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases diagnosis was confirmed by means of MRI or conventional angiography of brain vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the patients, 22 were female and 1 was male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, plasma levels of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III (ATIII) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 15 of 23 patients, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> was also determined, and found positive in 3 patients (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 22 female patients, 15 (68%) were on low-<z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> (containing less than 50 microg <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>) oral contraceptive (OC) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This percentage of OC use by patients with CVST is much higher than that of the rest of the female Italian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OC use was associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> in two cases, with a deficiency of protein C in 1 case and a deficiency of protein S in another.Whether low-<z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> Ocs may induce cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> is an open matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to our data, it may be argued that Ocs, even if at low <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> content, represent a major risk factor for CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of Ocs, as is the case for systemic venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, may further increase the risk of CVST in women carrying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> or other inherited hyperthrombotic conditions </plain></SENT>
