<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although coronary sinus catheter-related injuries (CSCRIs) are rare, they are potentially lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate such injuries, the repair methods used, and to identify related risk factors for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 10,552 cardiac surgical procedures from 1995 to 2000 in which retrograde cardioplegia was used revealed 10 cases (n = 10) of CSCRIs (0.095%) at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These injuries occurred during coronary bypass, valve replacement, and combined procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Management included direct suture, vein patch, or pericardial "on-lay" patch repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred (20% mortality) from failure of CSCRI repair; 8 of 10 injuries (80%) were successfully repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had delayed, localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e>, which resolved spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> that was assessed 3 and 5 years later by coronary angiography; the coronary sinus was found to be patent in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 6 patients have been asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repair of CSCRIs can be challenging as it can be complicated by inadequate myocardial protection, inadvertent coronary artery injuries, and possibly, subsequent coronary sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repair of CSCRIs should be carried out on an arrested, well-protected heart providing secure hemostasis and coronary sinus patency </plain></SENT>
