<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients averaged 7.4 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They commonly presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and otalgia (seven of seven patients), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (six of seven patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had abnormal otoscopy, and four of seven patients had a <z:mp ids='MP_0006252'>lateral rectus palsy</z:mp>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> was not always present (only three of seven patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent MRI with venography (MRV) for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were admitted to the hospital (average length of stay 8 days) and treated with antibiotics (six of seven patients with i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29007">ceftriaxone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of seven were treated with simple mastoidectomy and concurrent middle ear ventilation tubes; two patients received only medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average follow up was 114 months (range 33-387 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had long-term sequela: one had persistent mild lateral gaze <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> and another had unilateral moderate to severe high frequency <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six of seven patients had follow up imaging (average 15 months, range 1-40 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four of six patients showed recanalization of the lateral sinus on repeat imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on the current experience in the modern era of MRV and broad-spectrum antibiotics, a new treatment algorithm is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is an uncommon cranial complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The advent of non-invasive diagnosis and effective broad-spectrum antibiotics has drastically decreased the mortality and altered the diagnostic and treatment paradigm </plain></SENT>
