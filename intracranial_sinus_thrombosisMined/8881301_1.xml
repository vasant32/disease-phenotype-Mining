<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may also be seen in young babies without known predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: From 1988 to 1994, 11 children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (longitudinal sinus) in the first year of their life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from two days to 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo>, pseudo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cerebri were the first clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of longitudinal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was suggested by unenhanced CT scan, confirmed by colour doppler flow imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, with absence of blood flow in the longitudinal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repeated doppler flow imaging showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> resolution within 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was associated with predisposing factors in seven cases and appeared idiopathic in the four others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of longitudinal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can be made more accurately and noninvasively by colour doppler flow and angio-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> appears unnecessary and dangerous in idiopathic forms </plain></SENT>
