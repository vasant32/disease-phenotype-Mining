<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On physical examinations, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001482'>subcutaneous nodules</z:hpo> were noted in the chest, abdomen and extremities with dilated veins in the chest wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the discoloration of the skin attributable to the venous occlusion was noted in the left foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations failed to reveal any abnormalities except for moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choked disc</z:e> in bilateral ocular fundi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spinal puncture revealed CSF pressure as high as 350 mmH2O with slight increase in cell numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT demonstrated small intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> bilaterally in occipital lobes with evidence of "empty delta" sign in the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On angiographical findings, the superior sagittal sinus was not demonstrated in venous phase and the blood was drained mainly through the paravertebral plexus and the pterygoid plexus without any abnormalities in arterial and capillary phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serological examination revealed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> especially in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">Low Density Lipoprotein</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">Very Low Density Lipoprotein</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On etiological considerations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these abnormalities seemed to be derived from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023804" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple symmetrical lipomatosis</z:e> was defined as a "<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">storage disease</z:e>" in which laboratory examinations revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> especially in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and in some subfraction of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although not a typical case, there must be some possibilities that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipomatosis</z:e> of this case is secondary to disorder of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of various pathological conditions observed in this case were considered to be due to the disorder of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
