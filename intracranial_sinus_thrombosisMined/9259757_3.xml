<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was performed with a range-gated 2-MHz transducer in 6 patients with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, in 5 subjects with platelet hyperaggregability, and in 20 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emboli monitoring was performed mainly in one distal internal jugular vein for 10 to 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three of the six patients (50%) with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with platelet hyperaggregation or healthy volunteers revealed microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microemboli can be found in superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their prognostic significance remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
