<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can lead to intracranial venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and can be complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case report of a patient who underwent endovascular recanalization and stenting of a thrombosed occipital sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old patient with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> refractory to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography delineated multiple dural arteriovenous fistulae and persistent occlusion of the posterior sagittal, occipital, and bilateral transverse dural sinuses with retrograde cortical venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After embolization of the dural arteriovenous fistulae, a transvenous approach was used to recanalize and perform balloon angioplasty of the right internal jugular vein and the occipital and left transverse sinuses, resulting in subsequent clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's condition deteriorated 3 days later with reocclusion of both balloon-dilated sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeat angioplasty and then deployment of an endovascular stent in the occipital sinus were performed, and reestablishment of venous outflow was achieved, resulting in a decrease of intracranial venous pressure from 41 to 14 mm Hg and neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the 3-month follow-up examination, the stented occipital sinus remained patent and served as the only conduit for extracranial venous outflow; the patient remained neurologically intact at the 12-month follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report of mechanical recanalization, balloon angioplasty, and stent deployment in the occipital sinus to provide sustained venous outflow for the treatment of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with retrograde cortical venous drainage in a patient with dural pansinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> refractory to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
