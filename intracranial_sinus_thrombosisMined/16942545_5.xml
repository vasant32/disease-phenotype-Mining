<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cortical and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (CDVT) without dural sinus involvement is uncommon and presents diagnostic difficulty for many reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to determine the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and clinical findings in patients with CDVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> proved on MRI included in our Registry, corresponding to 0.1% of 4650 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and 18 of them had follow-up MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was evaluated by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale at the time of discharge and during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients presented cortical venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 21 of them had involvement of the dorsomedial venous system, six had a defect in the posteroinferior venous group, and five had a defect in the anteroinferior venous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients presented simultaneous involvement of the superficial and deep venous system; seven with a defect in the parietal and internal cerebral veins (three with involvement of vein of Gallen), four with a defect in the temporooccipital (vein of Labb√©) and basal vein of Rosenthal, two with a deficit in the anterior frontotemporal and uncal-pterygoid venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> primarily localized to the thalami bilaterally and the basal ganglia on the right because of occlusion of the thalamostriate veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main presenting symptoms of CDVT were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, focal neurologic signs, partial complex or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo>, and consciousness disturbances in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, presented alone or in combination at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CDVT was more than twofold more frequent in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy, puerperium, oral contraceptive use, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were the most common predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Computerized tomography, conventional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging showing ischemic and/or hemorrhagic lesion that does not follow the boundary of classical arterial boundaries without signs of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and partial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> followed by focal neurologic signs may predict CDVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The outcome of patients with cortical venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was good, but not in those with cortical plus deep venous infarction </plain></SENT>
