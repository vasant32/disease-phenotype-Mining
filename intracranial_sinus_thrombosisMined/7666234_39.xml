<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rat model was developed to determine the role of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and elevated sinus pressures in the pathogenesis of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five protocols were tested to compare various sinus pressures and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a sinus: 1) Control I, sham operation (five animals); 2) Control II, occlusion of the right common carotid artery, the right external jugular vein, and the vein draining the left transverse sinus, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sagittal sinus (10 animals); 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (AVF) I, anastomosis of the right common carotid artery to the external jugular vein causing retrograde flow through the transverse sinus (10 animals); 4) AVF II, anastomosis (as described in AVF I) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sagittal sinus (12 animals); 5) AVF III, anastomosis (as described in AVF I) as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sagittal sinus and occlusion of the vein draining the transverse sinus on the left (12 animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial and sagittal sinus pressures were monitored and cerebral angiograms were obtained intraoperatively and again 90 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Afterward, the animals were sacrificed and their brains and dura were examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formation of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> resulted in a significant (p &lt; 0.05) threefold increase in sagittal sinus pressure in the AVF II group and a significant (p &lt; 0.05) sixfold increase in the AVF III group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> (three in the AVF II group and four in the AVF III group) were demonstrated angiographically and histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The seven malformations were located adjacent to a thrombosed sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were within the dura and sinus wall with direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-sinus wall connections demonstrated in four of the malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other three lesions displayed arteriovenous connections within the sinus wall and dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the importance of not only sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but also sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the development of a dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
