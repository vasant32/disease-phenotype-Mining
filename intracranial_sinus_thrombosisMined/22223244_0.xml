<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Postpartum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> (PPA), a rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the puerperium, is heralded by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> within 1-2 weeks after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrates segmental vasoconstriction that often resolves spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PPA is generally regarded as benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to define clinical presentations, radiological findings, and outcomes of patients with PPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients from 3 centers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological symptoms and angiography showing vasoconstriction in the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients without neuroimaging and with diagnoses of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, clinical symptoms, neuroimaging findings, and clinical condition at hospital discharge were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients (mean age, 31 years; range, 15-41) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median gestation was 38 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve (67%) had a history of prior uneventful pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptoms began on median day 5 postpartum and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (n=16, 89%), focal deficit (n=9, 50%), visual disturbance (n=8, 44%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (n=6, 33%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (n=5, 28%), often in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging was abnormal in most (n=13, 72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most common abnormalities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n=7, 39%), vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (n=6, 35%), and infarction (n=6, 35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were markedly variable with full recovery seen in 9 (50%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after a fulminant course in 4 (22%), and residual deficits in 5 (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior reports, this group of patients with PPA had a higher proportion of nonbenign outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most patients who undergo neuroimaging have parenchymal abnormalities, which are most often <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (hemorrhagic or ischemic) or reversible vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
