<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A previously healthy 21-yr-old, primiparous, preeclamptic parturient was admitted to the hospital at 37 weeks gestation for uterine contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before pregnancy she was taking no medication other than oral contraceptives and was a non-smoker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> was established on the first attempt at 8 cm of cervical dilation, in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of labour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following an uneventful delivery, on the third day postpartum, the patient experienced gradual <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of an atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> with unclear postural character, followed by focal neurological signs five days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emergency neuroimaging revealed direct evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the posterior sagittal venous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation was initiated with iv <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (500 UI x kg(-1) x day(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> decreased progressively and full motor recovery was noted by day 14 postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 24 days, the patient was discharged without any neurological disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Common inherited thrombophilic dispositions were absent, with the exception of a decrease in protein S level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Central <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, while rare, is a recognized cause of puerperium <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present case highlights the importance of considering the diagnosis in the presence of postpartum atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> following spinal anesthesia/<z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early intervention with systemic heparinization is critical when the diagnosis is confirmed </plain></SENT>
