<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenesis, clinical features, radiographic findings and therapeutic outcomes of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> were examined with computed tomography, magnetic resonance and angiography, diagnosed as having non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and treated with thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 3 men and 2 women, aged from 22 to 49 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptom duration ranged from 1 month to 7 months, and 4 of the 5 patients were associated with venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed cold and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, and 3 patients had no evident predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the infusion of thrombolytic and systemic anti-coagulant therapy, the neurological symptoms and signs of the patients were alleviated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is more sensitive and accurate than MRI on diagnosing intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may play an important role in the assessment of the treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis and anticoagulation of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment not only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage but also in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
