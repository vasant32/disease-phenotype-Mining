<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>Hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the rostral third of the SSS is a well-known variant and constitutes the most frequent variation of the SSS after preferential drainage to one of the transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to describe unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the rostral end of the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTA performed in 100 consecutive patients studied for conditions other than dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was reviewed for the presence of a unilateral or bilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associated dural venous sinus anomalies were recorded as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angiographic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of unilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS was illustrated by 2 cases further imaged with DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS was found in 7 patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, compensatory drainage occurred through a large superior frontal vein that joined the SSS in the region of the coronal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the 7 patients with a unilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS had at least another dural venous sinus anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete or bilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS was noted in 3 patients (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS is more than twice as frequent as bilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is the most frequently encountered variation of the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of this anatomic variation is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and to avoid erroneously mistaking it for a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four types of variations of the rostral SSS may be identified: 1) classic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> with a fully developed rostral SSS; 2) duplication of the rostral SSS; 3) complete or bilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS; 4) unilateral hypoplastic rostral SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 4 types of rostral SSS variations can be explained by studying the embryologic development of the SSS </plain></SENT>
