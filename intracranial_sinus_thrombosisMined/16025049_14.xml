<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of children admitted with complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000255'>acute sinusitis</z:hpo> from January 1995 to July 2002 to a tertiary care children's hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred four patients were reviewed with the following complications: orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> (51), orbital abscesses (44), epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyemas</z:mpath> (7), subdural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyemas</z:mpath> (6), intracerebral abscesses (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (2), cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472513" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pott's puffy tumors</z:e> (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six percent were males (P &lt; 0.001), and 64.4% presented from November to March (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with isolated orbital complications were younger than patients with intracranial complications (mean, 6.5 versus 12.3 years), had a shorter stay (mean, 4.2 versus 16.6 days), and had shorter duration of symptoms (mean, 5.4 versus 14.3 days; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete resolution was documented for 54/55 patients with restricted ocular motility, 7/8 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, 3/3 patients with a nonreactive pupil, 7/7 with neurological deficits, and 2/4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common organism isolated was Streptococcus milleri (11/36 patients with surgical cultures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mortalities occurred, and persistent morbidity occurred in 4 patients (3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant deficits on presentation, permanent morbidity was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Streptococcus milleri is a common pathogen with complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
