<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We used the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> (ISCVT) sample (624 patients, with a median follow-up time of 478 days) to develop a Cox proportional hazards regression model to predict outcome, dichotomised by a modified Rankin Scale score &gt;2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the model hazard ratios, a risk score was derived and a cut-off point selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model and the score were tested in 2 validation samples: (1) the prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral Venous Thrombosis</z:hpo> Portuguese Collaborative Study Group (VENOPORT) sample with 91 patients; (2) a sample of 169 consecutive CVT patients admitted to 5 ISCVT centres after the end of the ISCVT recruitment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, c statistics and overall efficiency to predict outcome at 6 months were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The model (hazard ratios: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> 4.53; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> 4.19; <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep venous system 3.03; mental status disturbance 2.18; male gender 1.60; intracranial haemorrhage 1.42) had overall efficiencies of 85.1, 84.4 and 90.0%, in the derivation sample and validation samples 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the risk score (range from 0 to 9) with a cut-off of &gt;or=3 points, overall efficiency was 85.4, 84.4 and 90.1% in the derivation sample and validation samples 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity in the combined samples were 96.1 and 13.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CVT risk score has a good estimated overall rate of correct classifications in both validation samples, but its specificity is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be used to avoid unnecessary or dangerous interventions in low-risk patients, and may help to identify high-risk CVT patients </plain></SENT>
