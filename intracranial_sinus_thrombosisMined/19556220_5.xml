<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) in children is associated with a high incidence of serious morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presenting features are variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can be diagnostically challenging and the optimal treatment is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To describe the features of a series of children with CVST treated in a single paediatric neurology centre and to discuss the role of local thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electronic databases were searched using diagnostic labels and International Classification of Diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) codes to identify children aged 1 month to under 17 years with CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 21 children were identified over a period of 8.25 years with a median age of 7.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (15 children), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (14 children) and visual disturbance (eight children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Signs found included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> (16 children), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (six children) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sixth nerve palsy</z:e> (six children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common underlying condition was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle ear infection</z:e> (13 children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases received unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and four severe cases received local pharmacological thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>48% of cases had an adverse outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sixth nerve palsy</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: CVST has non-specific presenting features and a high risk of significant morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CVST is typically found in association with a predisposing condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is the mainstay of treatment, thrombolysis may reverse deterioration as seen in three cases in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of thrombolysis at present </plain></SENT>
