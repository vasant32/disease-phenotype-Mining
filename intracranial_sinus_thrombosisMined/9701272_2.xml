<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological problems may complicate the posttransplant period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Possible causes include the conditioning regimen (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>), central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, and fungal), or factors secondary to the immunosuppressive therapy and side effects of drug treatment (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and tacrolimus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, the occlusion of a cerebral venous vessel or a sinus, is an unusual cause of neurologic symptoms in patients after transplantation, and this has not been reported in the literature previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients presenting with various neurological symptoms after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation underwent computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging as a primary diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was found as the cause for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>; it was the cause of disturbance of consciousness in two patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> symptoms resolved without any neurologic deficiency after anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> followed by dicumarol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> should be considered as a cause of neurological symptoms in patients after transplantation under immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is rapidly confirmed by noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic heparinization is the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
