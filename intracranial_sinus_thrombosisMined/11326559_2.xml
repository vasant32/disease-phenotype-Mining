<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with pathology in intracranial venous structures or with inadequate image quality of the venous system were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arachnoid granulations were found in 12 of the 57 patients (21.1%), always at the junction of the vein of Labbé and the transverse sinus; the vein of Labbé was present in 55 patients (96.5%), most often without associated arachnoid granulations; the latter, however, were not observed in the absence of a vein of Labbé </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the close, constant anatomic relationship between arachnoid granulations in the transverse sinus and the termination of the vein of Labbé </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This observation may help to differentiate arachnoid granulations from pathologic conditions involving the transverse sinus such as dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The constant character of this relationship suggests a developmental role of afferent veins in the formation of arachnoid granulations </plain></SENT>
