<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A male neonate diagnosed as VGAM with prenatal ultrasonography and MRI presented severe cardiac and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> soon after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five sessions of transarterial embolization using NBCA were performed during the first 6 months of his life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The shunt flow was effectively reduced and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was resolved after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography performed 2.5 years after the last embolization revealed complete obliteration of VGAM and newly developed small dural AVF on the wall of the thrombosed falcorial sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe that the dural AVF in this case was caused by local venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or induction of angiogenic factor during the thrombosing process of VGAM </plain></SENT>
