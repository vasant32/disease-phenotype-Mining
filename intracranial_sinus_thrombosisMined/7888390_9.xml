<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This anomaly has been reported to carry a dismal prognosis both in terms of neurological outcome as well as cosmetic appearance if treatment is delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the paucity of data concerning the results of early operative intervention, it remains uncertain whether aggressive craniofacial decompressive/reconstructive procedures are effective in ameliorating the effects of the malformation on both neurological development and cosmetic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper reports the treatment and outcome of 7 children with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> malformation treated at our institution between 1981 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children underwent an initial decompressive craniectomy with the removal of at least 50% of the cranial vault for relief of high intracranial pressure in early infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our first 4 patients underwent near total calvariectomy whereas the 3 children treated subsequently have undergone a staged approach with anterior followed by posterior craniectomies with bone morcellation and replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent reconstructions, intended to further improve the cosmetic appearance, were performed later in infancy or in early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranges from 17 months to 9 years, with a mean of 61 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term results are reported with regard to neurological outcome as well as normalization of skull shape in terms of both the cephalic indices and general cosmetic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 4 children initially treated with total calvariectomy, only 1 child is neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and has a good cosmetic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One child is severely impaired neurologically following a sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> suffered during a secondary reconstructive procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
