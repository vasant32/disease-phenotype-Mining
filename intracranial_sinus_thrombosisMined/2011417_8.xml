<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of observations of the first 100 neonates at the University of Texas Health Science Center (Houston) who received magnetic resonance imaging of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system by means of a high-field image (1.5 T) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were assessed prospectively to be at risk neurodevelopmental delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This first report specifically addresses the appearance of primarily hemorrhagic intracranial lesions, including <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (n = 28), and extracerebral lesions, which include 3 cases of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The signal intensities of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> underwent a characteristic evolution with time with only minor variations in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging detected direct evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> for up to 2 months, but hemosiderin was detected as a late indicator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> for up to 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was equal in benefit to head ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, but magnetic resonance imaging was also able to approximate the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was superior for the evaluation of extracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>; ultrasonography failed to detect any of these lesions and computed tomography detected only 3 of 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> was assessed, but the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to predict long-term neurodevelopmental delay is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing project </plain></SENT>
