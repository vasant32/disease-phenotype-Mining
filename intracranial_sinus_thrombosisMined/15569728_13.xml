<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The common entity cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is associated with the poorly characterized imaging finding of parenchymal abnormalities; diffusion-weighted imaging has offered some insight into these manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relationship between the diffusion constant from apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) with follow-up imaging findings and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the medical records and T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of 13 patients with CVT complicated by intraparenchymal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted (DW) images and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps were evaluated for increased, decreased, or unchanged signal intensity and were compared with signal intensity of contralateral, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> were obtained in nine pixel regions of interest in abnormal regions in eight of the 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients had superficial CVT, and five had superficial and deep CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CVT of deep veins was associated with deep gray nucleus and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo>, whereas superficial CVT was associated with cortical and subcortical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four nonhemorrhagic lesions were identified in 10 of 13 patients on the basis of follow-up imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had lesions with decreased diffusion that appeared hyperintense on follow-up T2-weighted images, three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had lesions with decreased diffusion that resolved, and seven patients had lesions with increased diffusion that resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of 10 patients had more than one lesion type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was noted in mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> for lesions with decreased diffusion that resolved compared with lesions with decreased diffusion that persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DW imaging in these patients disclosed three lesion types: lesions with elevated diffusion that resolved, consistent with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>; lesions with low diffusion that persisted, consistent with cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity; and lesions with low diffusion that resolved in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This information may be important in prospectively determining severity of irreversible injury and in patient treatment </plain></SENT>
