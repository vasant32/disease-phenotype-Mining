<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present a patient with traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>extradural haematoma</z:hpo> successfully evacuated with good clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the patient then deteriorated and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cause, at post mortem, was a propagating CVST, sustained at the time of head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CVST, although rare, is therefore an important cause of deterioration in traumatic head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This patient with CVST is unique in that CVST was not considered as a diagnosis in the face of more obvious pathology and was responsible for late deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discuss the potential difficulties in both the detection and management of such a complication, particularly in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>extradural haematoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
