<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: HIV-1 is a neurotropic virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a resource-limited country such as India, large populations of affected patients now have access to adequate chemoprophylaxis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> (OIs), allowing them to live longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately the poor availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has allowed <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication to proceed unchecked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has resulted in an increase in the debilitating neurologic manifestations directly mediated by the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to identify and describe in detail the direct neurologic manifestations of HIV-1 in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive, HIV-infected patients (excluding the neurologic manifestations produced by opportunistic pathogens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Three hundred successive cases of HIV-1 infected, ART-naive patients with neurologic manifestations were studied over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each case was studied in detail to identify and then exclude manifestations due to opportunistic pathogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining cases were then analyzed specially in regard to their occurrence and the degree of immune suppression (CD4+ cell counts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND PATIENTS: The study was carried out in an apex, tertiary, referral care center for HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were admitted for a detailed analysis.No interventions were carried out, as this was an observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 300 cases, 67 (22.3%) had neurologic manifestations due to the direct effects of HIV-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> involved the neuroaxis at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The distribution of cases showed that the region most commonly involved was the brain (50.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The manifestations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndromes (29.8%), demyelinating illnesses (5.9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> complex (5.9%), and venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The other manifestations seen were <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo> (35.8% of cases), spinal cord pathologies (5.9% of cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radiculopathies</z:e> (4.4% of cases), and a single case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occurrence of these diseases and their progression were then correlated with the CD4+ cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> is responsible for a large number of nonopportunistic neurologic manifestations that occur across a large immune spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>During the early course of the disease, the polyclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hypergammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> induced by the virus results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating diseases</z:e> of the central- and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and PNS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> progresses, the direct toxic effects of the virus unfold, directly damaging the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and PNS, resulting in protean clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
