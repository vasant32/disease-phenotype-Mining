<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report an unusual case of acquired dural-pial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) following sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: Initial angiography performed in a 39-year-old man showed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the right transverse sinus (TS) but no vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography 29 months later revealed recanalization of the SSS and the TS, retrograde cortical venous drainage which suggested that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sinuses probably propagated into the adjacent parietal cortical veins, and development of a dural-pial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> at or near the site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in more than one cortical vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete surgical excision of the lesion was accomplished without neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present case suggests the possibility that the pial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> is not only a congenital condition but also may develop as an acquired lesion </plain></SENT>
