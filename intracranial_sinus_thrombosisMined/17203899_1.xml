<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Transvenous embolization is an effective treatment for dural arterio-venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the event of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, embolization can be performed by direct puncture via craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with transcranial venous embolization in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients underwent transcranial venous embolization of a type-III dural arterio-venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> of the transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The craniectomy was performed with neuronavigation assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The surgical approach consisted in a minimal exposure of the sinus with a drill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuronavigation allowed accurate placement of the craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endovascular treatment was performed in a second stage, enabling complete and stable occlusion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This combined treatment of dural AVFs associating craniectomy and transcranial puncture of the sinus is simple and efficient when retrograde navigation through the internal jugular vein cannot be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuronavigation is helpful in accurately positioning the craniectomy </plain></SENT>
