<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 28 consecutive patients with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> admitted to our hospital in recent 3 years, six patients underwent combined intra-arterial and intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each patient, local contact thrombolysis was performed with balloon catheter to break clot and urokinase infused for thrombolysis in sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the same time, urokinase (100,000 IU/h) was infused intra-arterially via internal carotid artery to dissolve the venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic outcomes, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (GCS), neuroimaging results and modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the six treated patients, two were males and four females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 38 +/- 13 (range from 22 to 57) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Completely recanalization was observed in five patients, whose clinical symptoms recovered completely (mRS score 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient in whom thrombolysis was delayed died the day after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment with combined intra-arterial and intravenous thrombolysis may improve neurological outcomes of severe cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
