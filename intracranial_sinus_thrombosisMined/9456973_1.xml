<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our small study population, hemorrhagic venous infarction was common (three of four patients) among patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and activated protein C resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of five patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had positive tests for activated protein C resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding, in conjunction with data from other studies, suggests that patients with dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may need to be studied for the presence of activated protein C resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A positive finding for activated protein C resistance can be important not only in helping to explain the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in affected individuals but also in identifying families at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
