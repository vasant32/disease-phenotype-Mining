<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 2007, the authors treated 15 women (age range 23-45 years) in whom neurosurgical management was used for overt <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of cerebral sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were healthy, with a history of use of oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was the most common symptom, followed by motor focal deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were located in the thalamic and basal ganglia region in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven women had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 3 had ventricular dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was done in 10 patients, and conventional angiography was done in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of chromosomal abnormalities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was done in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent external ventricular drainage, and 1 had a decompressive craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had absence of signal in the cerebral sinus rectus, with associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the transverse sinus in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were negative for additional vascular malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment included <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> in 9 cases, and enoxaparin in the other 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis was positive for prothrombin mutation G20210A (factor II variant) in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration of 53 months demonstrated no neurological deficit in 10 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 3, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One woman died 5 days after a decompressive craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> secondary to oral contraception in young women, including lesions in critical and deep regions, can be treated medically with acceptable morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, a subgroup of patients needed basic neurosurgical management of the lesions, including surgical measures for controlling raised ICP </plain></SENT>
