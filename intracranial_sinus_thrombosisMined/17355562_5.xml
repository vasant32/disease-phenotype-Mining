<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four independent observers rated a convenience sample of 40 MR/MR angiographies to assess whether or not each dural sinus and major cerebral veins were occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interobserver reliability was measured using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was comparable between the six pairs of raters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Agreement was excellent for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep cerebral venous system (kappa = 1.00), cerebellar veins (kappa = 1.00), superior sagittal sinus (kappa range: 0.82-1) and right jugular vein (kappa range: 0.84-0.95); good to excellent for the right transverse/sigmoid sinus (kappa range: 0.75-0.90) and the left jugular vein (kappa range: 0.65-0.85); moderate to excellent for the left lateral sinus (kappa range: 0.59-0.78) and the straight sinus (kappa range: 0.59-0.92); poor to good for the cortical veins (kappa range: 0.02-0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Agreement between observers varies with the location of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is good or excellent for most of the occluded sinus and veins, except for the cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that information on the location of CVT can be reliably collected and used in multicentre studies </plain></SENT>
