<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess accuracy of a management program in patients at risk for alloimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (NAITP) and to describe perinatal outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Nineteen fetuses at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were identified using obstetric history, HLA type of the mother and fetal phenotyping in cases where paternal heterozygozity for the offending antigen was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cordocentesis was timed according to obstetric history and performed with safety precautions to prevent haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High dose intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) was administered to the mother in cases with a fetal platelet count &lt; 100 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The platelet antagonisms were distributed as follows: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-1a in 15 patients, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-5a in two, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-3a in one, with one further woman who had antibodies against a private antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> multigravidas (N = 18) had previously given birth to an infant with NAITP and two of those infants had experienced severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two fetuses were negative for the offending antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median and mean platelet count at first cordocentesis was 26 and 75 x 10(9)/l respectively (range 3-276) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 46 cordocentesis were carried out, of which 37 were followed by platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> complications were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IVIG was administered to eight mothers and two fetuses responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine infants were delivered by caesarean section (CS) and 10 vaginally at a mean gestational age of 37 weeks (range 34-41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median and mean platelet count at birth was 141.5 and 140 x 10(9)/l, respectively (range 36-314) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound examination, both ante- and postnatally, revealed no intracranial haemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was one procedure related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> and one infant suffered from <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> in the neonatal period due to a sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, possibly related to the platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When obstetric history is taken into account cordocentesis in NAITP can be postponed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Safety recommendations described in this study allow cordocentesis without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, our study does not support routine cordocentesis in patients with a history of NAITP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Both the risks of cordocentesis, and the lack of prospective data on the magnitude of the risk of intrauterine or peripartal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, should be considered </plain></SENT>
