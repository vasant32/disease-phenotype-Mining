<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its low incidence and multiple etiologies, the optimum therapy for this condition will only be elucidated by a multicenter, randomized prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At our institution, we favor early and aggressive management of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with transfemoral, venous intradural infusions of the fibrinolytic agent urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, treatment of only 13 patients using this technique has been reported in the English literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report adds 12 more such treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of preinfusion <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 5 patients, four of which were hemorrhagic, we incurred no major therapeutic morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional sinus patency was achieved in 11 of 12 patients, with our only true failure occurring in an individual with symptoms of at least 2 months' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good to excellent clinical outcome was achieved in 10 of 11 patients (one newborn had inadequate follow-up) </plain></SENT>
