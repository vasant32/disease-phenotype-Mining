<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTS: Clinical symptoms and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) may be nonspecific and unreliable, or even entirely absent, in hydrocephalic infants and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even with a radiological examination, it is often difficult to distinguish between "arrested <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>" and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> requiring treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present two cases with unusual and initially misleading clinical manifestations of increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, i.e. raised ICP, were not recognised until demonstrated by a long-term ICP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a 5-month-old boy with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> head circumference and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> psychomotor development, the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of episodes of torticollis and screaming were the only symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No pathology underlying the developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and the raised ICP could be established, but the boy's condition improved after a shunt operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other case, symptoms and signs consisted primarily in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the facial veins with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at the age of 2-3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the girl also presented a congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subvalvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, the venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> was initially thought to reflect a vena cava superior syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further radiological examinations, however, revealed an extensive sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> underlying the raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The girl underwent shunt insertion, and the venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cases illustrate that though clinical and radiological findings may be very doubtful, or unusual for increased ICP, direct diagnostic long-term ICP monitoring should always be contemplated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only ICP monitoring can reveal with certainty whether disturbed CSF dynamics are involved, requiring a CSF diverting operation to treat and stabilise the condition </plain></SENT>
