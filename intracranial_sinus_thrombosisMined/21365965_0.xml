<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: To identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant publications on MRSA-induced CST in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven publications were included in this review describing patients age 19 or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together, with the case included in this publication, a total of 8 cases of MRSA induced CST have been documented since 2003 </plain></SENT>
