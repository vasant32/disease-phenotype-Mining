<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurs, of which the symptoms may be alleviated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical brain function improvement may be directly attributed to the effect of the decreased ICP, or to the decreased pressure on the venous sinus which alleviates venous blood flow and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, worsening, rather than improvement of symptoms are occasionally observed in patients after CSF drainage, and therefore it is as yet difficult to determine the precise indications for CSF drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors of this study suggest that external CSF drainage of sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may accelerate the sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and aggravate symptoms in such a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other words, the sagittal sinus differs from other sinuses in that when sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> develops, CSF absorption is impeded from the early stages, leading to a higher likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>, because most of the CSF are normally absorbed through the arachnoid villi and drain into the sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>External CSF drainage and subsequently decreased ICP will improve sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after implementation of CSF drainage of the sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but on the other hand, this decreased CSF drainage leads to decreased venous sinus blood flow, both of which may result in aggravation of the sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it is also suggested that CSF drainage may be accomplished safely on the unilateral lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> because CSF drainage may alleviate venous sinus obstruction, and does not influence the sinus blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We, authors of this study suggest that caution should be taken when external CSF drainage of the sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is performed to prevent further aggravation of intracranial pressure elevation </plain></SENT>
