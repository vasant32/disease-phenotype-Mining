<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three infants presented with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> after birth and at the age of 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient was found to have occlusion of the straight sinus and large collateral veins at the base of the brain, presumably due to venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, supporting the concept of vascular compression of the facial nerve at its exit from the brain stem as a mechanism for the production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other patients each had an intrinsic mass compressing the fourth ventricle, located in the lower pons and extending into the cerebellar vermis and right cerebellar peduncle in one; in the other patient, the mass involved the cerebellar vermis and right middle cerebellar peduncle alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients widen the etiologic spectrum of the syndrome and show that serious intracranial diseases may underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> in infancy </plain></SENT>
