<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (CCF) is an abnormal communication between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of spontaneous CCF remains unclear, although sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is known to be a predisposing factor for dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because spontaneous CCFs are mainly of the dural type, we considered that thrombogenic conditions, such as, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> might be associated with CCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old woman complained of conjunctival injection and retro-orbital pain that first appeared 1-month before visiting our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had no history of head trauma or intracranial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>Exophthalmos</z:hpo> and chemosis were observed in her left eye, which also had lower visual acuity and higher intraocular pressure than the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images and cerebral angiography revealed a left dural CCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her protein S was low, at 41% (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range: 70-140%), but other hematologic values related to coagulation were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms were relieved after initial transvenous coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a newly developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sixth-nerve palsy</z:e> was detected 4 days after initial embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography revealed a minimal shunt, and thus transvenous coil embolization was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two days later, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> started reducing, and 1-month later it had almost disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of spontaneous dural CCF in a Korean patient with concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sixth-nerve palsy</z:e> developed after transvenous coil embolization in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This additional symptom caused by the residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was relieved after additional transarterial embolization </plain></SENT>
