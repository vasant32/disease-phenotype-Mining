<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experience suggests that VI-DSA will have a more limited application than was originally expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is a low-risk, cost-efficient technique for serial and postoperative studies and for screening outpatients who may have occlusive extracranial lesions that have not been detected by noninvasive tests; however, false-negative results may be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AI-DSA provides far more accurate and reliable results than VI-DSA and has the potential for increasing the flexibility, efficiency, and safety of angiography, in comparison with conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
