<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The physiopathologic mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> DAVF are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> followed by an increase in venous pressure and/or an increased procoagulatory activity of the coagulation system are associated at least with some DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the coagulation profile in patients with DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the association of thrombophilic abnormalities, sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and DAVF should be analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 patients with cranial DAVF were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were analyzed for 20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene, resistance to activated protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen (Fib), Textarin time (TT), antithrombin (AT), protein C and protein S activity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen (vWF:Ag), Ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo), D-Dimer (DD) and coagulation factor VIII-activity (F VIII) were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood was screened for the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombophilic risk factors were found in 5 (33%) of the 15 patients with cranial DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients had a heterozygote 20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene and one patient had a heterozygote FV Leiden mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was detected in two patients with grade 2b DAVF and was associated with a 20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, one patient had deficient protein C activity and screening for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies was positive in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the current series the frequency of prothrombin Gene 20210A mutation was higher in patients with DAVF compared to the general population, whereas the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore in patients with cranial DAVF thrombophilic abnormalities should be considered in the post-operative/post-interventional management </plain></SENT>
