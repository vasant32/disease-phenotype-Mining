<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) as a rare but important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of multidetector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) as a fast and cost-effective imaging tool in diagnosing CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients who presented with clinical symptoms of a possible CVST were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had received both MDCTA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging with venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three blinded readers were asked to identify the cerebral sinuses and veins in MDCTA and to evaluate the presence of CVST in MDCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consensus reading with interpretation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging served to establish the definite diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The consensus reading revealed CVST in 10 of the 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With MDCTA, the venous sinuses could be identified in 99.2% and the cerebral veins in 87.6% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of MDCTA for the diagnosis of CVST were 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that MDCTA provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of MDCTA in specific subsets of the general entity of CVST such as cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the cavernous sinus, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
