<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and types of abnormalities at arteriography in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) and ischemic cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and ischemic cerebrovascular events who underwent arteriography were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients over the age of 65 years were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patients met diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> angiograms were reviewed by two neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (74%) between the ages of 28 and 64 years (average age, 40 years) had abnormal angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had arterial abnormalities and one had dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten had solely intracranial abnormalities (nine arterial and one venous), six had solely extracranial arterial abnormalities, and one had both intracranial and extracranial arterial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arterial abnormalities included stem or branch occlusions of the cerebral or basilar arteries, which were generally solitary (six patients), and findings suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients had stenoses of the origins of two or more great vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had extracranial internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> or occlusions that were not typical of atheromatous disease, considered to be embolic in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In another patient, a stenosis of the origin of the internal carotid artery was present that appeared typical of atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Infarctions were seen on CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies in 13 of 17 patients with abnormal angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our group of patients, typical atheromatous lesions at the common carotid artery bifurcation were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Some lesions that are infrequent in the general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>-like findings and stenoses at the origin of great vessels) were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and cerebrovascular events appear to differ from the general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population with regard to types of arterial abnormalities seen at arteriography </plain></SENT>
