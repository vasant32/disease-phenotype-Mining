<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We are presenting the case of a 63 year-old man with a dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> of the transverse sigmoid sinus who developed focal deficits followed by less localized symptoms such a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> and eventually <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial cerebral angiography showed retrograde filling of the cortical and deep cerebral venous system with marked delay in venous empting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following embolization clinical symptoms completely cleared at the time that control angiography showed retrograde venous flow turning anterograde </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient's symptoms recurred four months later when there was a relapse of retrograde cerebral venous drainage at the time he developed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior longitudinal and right transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery were coincidental with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since control angiography still showed persistence of the AV shunting radical excision of the involved dural sinuses was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final outcome was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The physiopathological mechanism responsible for neurological deficits in our patient most likely was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of venous origin secondary to venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> resulting from retrograde cerebral venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical and angiographic presentation in few similar cases reported in the literature is reviewed </plain></SENT>
