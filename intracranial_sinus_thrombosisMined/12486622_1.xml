<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>Acute otitis media</z:hpo> is a common disease, mostly contracted at childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> has been decreased since the introduction of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently it is only developed in 0.004 % cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But despite of this fact, even today one should not neglect this condition as the complications such as intracranial spread and lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are still life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective study from 01/96 - 09/00 we reviewed the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> at our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally we compared study results out of 1972 until 1989 with our current results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether mastoidectomy has been carried out at 157 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cases have steadily increased since 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is confirmed by comparison with study results of previous years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients were between 8 months and 3 years old (60 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the patients first presented at our department, the first signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> were 19.5 days ago in average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>38 % of the patients received no antibiotic treatment before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A thickened mucous membrane was seen by the mastoidectomy mostly (58 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A subperiostal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> we noted in 8.5 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most common isolated bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (33 %) and Streptococcus pyogenes (11 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patients stayed at the department about 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In comparison to recent study results the "typical" <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> has decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The causative pathogens have not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the last years we realised an increasing number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> at our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The isolated bacteria are the same as presented in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Early surgery combined with an effective antibiotic treatment can avoid the known complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
