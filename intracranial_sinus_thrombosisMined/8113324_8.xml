<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we developed a model in rats to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term changes of brain function and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> following <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The superior sagittal sinus of rats was exposed, ligated, and injected with thrombogenic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the longitudinal sinus and ascending cortical veins was monitored by intravital fluorescence angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histology was studied at 24 h and 4 weeks after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and changes in intracranial pressure, electroencephalogram (EEG), and tissue impedance were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous locomotor activity was followed for 4 weeks after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment on tissue impedance was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus could be regularly induced, although pathological sequelae developed only if ascending veins were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sinus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was histologically characterized by bilateral, parasagittal infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> induction was followed by an increase in intracranial pressure from 4.7 +/- 1.6 to 12.8 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (n = 4) at 1 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, associated with an exponential rise in tissue impedance to 165 +/- 14% (n = 8) of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EEG changes were similar to those following global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and remained pathological for up to 6 months after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a permanent behavioral deficit spontaneous locomotor activity was reduced to 60 +/- 10% (n = 6) of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, the administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (1 IU/g body weight) after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induction was found to reverse the pathological tissue impedance response of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, involvement of ascending cortical veins following sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> appears to be critical for the development of irreversible tissue damage, such as infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Changes in intracranial pressure and tissue impedance suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> of a predominantly cytotoxic nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> led to long-term changes of brain function, as demonstrated by persistent disturbances of the EEG or of the spontaneous locomoter drive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These deficits may be amenable to treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
