<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transpalatal approach has a relatively wide exposure as compared to the transnasal, transantral and transethmoidal approches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The added advantage of a medial approach which follows medial landmarks and the flexibility of being able to extend exposure to the maxillary sinuses and pterygomaxillary space makes this an attractive approach for large lesions in the nasal passages, nasopharynx and sphenoid sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large mucoperiosteal flaps, care to avoid the palatine vessels, and application of palatal splint postoperatively, minimize complications and patient discomfort </plain></SENT>
