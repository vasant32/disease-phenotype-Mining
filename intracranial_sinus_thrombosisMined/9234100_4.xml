<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the safety and efficacy of local, direct, intra-arterial and intravenous fibrinolysis treatment in selected cases of clinically symptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the intracranial cerebral arteries and dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> progressive neurological deterioration, in spite of systemic anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet medications, presenting with occlusion of a major intracranial cerebral artery or dural sinus were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a transfemoral approach through a guiding catheter, a 2.5F microcatheter was guided directly into the intracranial cerebral circulation and embedded within the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusion of urokinase was then performed directly into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> until lysis was attained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 36 total patients, 27 cases were treated for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in 45 vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically, there was neurological improvement in 18 (66.7%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications directly related to therapy included symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in three cases (11.1%), which included 1 case (3.7%) of vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 8 (29.6%) patients, there was no evidence of clinical improvement, and in long-term follow-up there were 9 (33.3%) patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were treated for an intracerebral dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in ten vascular territories by local urokinase infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 7 (77.8%) cases, there was angiographic evidence of clot lysis and clinical improvement of the patient's neurological condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minor complications including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and noncerebral sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 3 (33.3%) patients, requiring adjustment in urokinase infusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Local, direct intra-arterial or intravenous infusion of thrombolytic drugs for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients may improve overall patient morbidity and mortality related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further clinical studies are warranted to evaluate this form of therapy </plain></SENT>
