<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) is a relatively rare cerebrovascular condition which accounts for 0.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk of CVST has been documented in patients with numerous conditions including central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, however, Japanese <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> (JE, epidemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> type B) with CVST has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a case of JE with CVST in a 17-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On admission, the patient was initially diagnosed as intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and soon after, brain magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging (MRI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> Venography (MRV) confirmed the diagnosis of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the blood JE-specific IgM antibody which proved weakly positive at first, turned positive one week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, our patient was diagnosed as CVST accompanied by JE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anti-infective therapy were initiated, which eventually lead to gradual recovery of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of CVST associated with JE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI and MRV represent a prime method for the diagnosis of CVST, while the positivity of JE virus IgM antibody, especially increased antibody levels within a short period, is of great significance to diagnose JE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The early diagnosis and timely treatment of this potentially lethal condition would improve its prognosis significantly </plain></SENT>
