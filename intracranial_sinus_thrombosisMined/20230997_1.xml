<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three patients underwent 2D and 3D MRV, whereby venous structures were evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, 10 were diagnosed with dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 12 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3D GEC MRV displayed superior sensitivity/specificity (90.9%/96.8%) compared to 2D TOF MRV (63.6%/48.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves also showed superiority of 3D GEC (0.91) versus 2D TOF (0.53) MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 31 healthy patients, the rate of complete visibility of venous structures was also greater for 3D GEC (95.8%) than for 2D TOF (62.1%) MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 3D GEC MRV is superior to 2D TOF MRV for providing more detail of the intracranial venous system, and can lead to better diagnosis of venous conditions </plain></SENT>
