<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these patients 5 had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 3 had a prolonged reversible neurologic deficit (PRIND), 3 cases were presented with a completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1 patient suffered from a suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of the sinus sagittalis superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total 8 cases showed pathological platelet accumulations in the vessel clinically affected, 5 extracranially and 3 intracranially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other 4 cases the platelet scintigraphy was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> showed pathological platelet accumulations in the appropriate vessel, even if the angiogram was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand platelet scintigraphy did not show any abnormality in 2 patients with an occlusion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>So platelet scintigraphy might be useful in the detection of small arterial lesions producing small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and which remain undetected by other diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
