<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using population-based, nationwide medical registries, we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients aged 0-18 years at the time of hospitalization with first-ever AIS and/or CSVT in Denmark between 1994 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records were retrieved and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 211 patients with AIS and 40 patients with CSVT corresponding to IRs of 1.33 (95% CI 1.16-1.52) and 0.25 (95% CI 0.19-0.34) per 100,000 person-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IRs peaked in infancy (&lt;1 year) for both AIS and CSVT with an additional peak among adolescents (15-18 years) for CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IR of AIS increased 3.9% per year (p=0.036), whereas no changes were found for CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 48.2% of the patients received antithrombotic treatment; no major complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-related 30-day case fatality ratios were 3.6% and 2.4%, respectively; neurological sequelae were found in 56.2% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The IR of AIS was highest in infants and had increased with 3.9% annually during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IR of CSVT had an additional peak in adolescence and remained unchanged over time </plain></SENT>
