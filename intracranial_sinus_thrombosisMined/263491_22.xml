<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Static radionuclide brain scans and dynamic radionuclide flow studies were also obtained in four patients; in two, findings diagnostic of lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These comprised a "negative on dynamic, hot on static" image, as well as a "hot on static with nonfilling on angiography." Computed cranial tomography findings included visualization of the thrombosed vein ("cord sign") or sinus ("empty triangle" or "delta sign"), multiple focal bilateral parasagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, intense tentorial enhancement, gyral enhancement indistinguishable from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, solitary intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, small ventricles, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excluding the patients with underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of whom survived, seven of the remaining eight patients expired during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of their illness, an 88% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This group includes one patient who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CCT findings, albeit without contrast enhancement, who was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The need for full neuroradiological evaluation, including angiography, is thus stressed if this highly fatal yet treatable condition is not to remain undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
