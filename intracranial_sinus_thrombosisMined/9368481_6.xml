<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A tight correlation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and ALL has also been hypothesized because of the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) found during the early period of chemotherapeutic treatment apart from L-Ase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the authors reporting on this subject, however, consider the remission induction phase of treatment the most risky, if not exclusive, for the development of a thrombotic event, in particular if it includes the administration of L-Ase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here two cases of ALL patients who experienced a cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a later phase of treatment, demonstrating that the thrombotic risk is surely exacerbated by chemotherapy but is not exclusive to the remission induction period </plain></SENT>
