<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Various imaging findings of cerebral sino-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CSVT) have been described on magnetic resonance venography (MRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of visualization of the arterial system on cerebral MRV, also described as arterial contamination, as an indirect sign of CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with a clinical suspicion of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain, followed by MRV sequence, based on 2D time of flight technique in the coronal oblique plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient's clinical symptoms and signs were noted with particular interest for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> on MRV, and of these, arterial contamination was visualized in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 13 cases, in which there was no evidence of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, arterial contamination was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of this finding was 59.25% (n = 16/27), specificity was 100%, positive predictive value was 100% and negative predictive value was 54.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 16 patients with arterial contamination, 12 patients had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> in the form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Visualization of the arterial system is a useful indirect sign of CSVT, and may be an indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
