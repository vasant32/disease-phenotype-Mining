<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of the waves, however, is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the ICP was recorded continuously, the size of the ventricular system was evaluated using computerized tomography (CT), the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow was studied using isotope cisternography, and the absorptive capacity of the CSF was determined by measuring the conductance to CSF outflow, in 94 patients with increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who received continuous ICP monitorings had a basic ICP level of more than 200 mmHg, and these patients were assigned to two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of the plateau waves in the ICP recordings: group I comprising 17 patients without plateau waves but with a high ICP resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> or hypertensive intracerebral haemorrhage, within 5 days after the start of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>; and group II consisting of 77 patients with both plateau waves and a high ICP resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumours</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> carcinomatosa, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The isotope cisternography and conductance to CSF outflow studies showed that there was neither a delay in CSF circulation nor an impairment of CSF absorption in the group 1 patients and these patients showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> on CT, whereas there was a marked sluggishness in the CSF flow and a severe defect in the CSF absorption capacities of the group II patients irrespective of the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present observations indicate that patients with a plateau-wave phenomenon have a marked impairment of CSF absorption and CSF flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the phenomenon is an important sign indicating an impairment of CSF absorption capacities </plain></SENT>
