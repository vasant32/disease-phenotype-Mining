<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is a common condition that sometimes indicates a life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) but is mostly harmless </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have performed a prospective study of 137 consecutive patients with this kind of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>=TCH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The examination included a CT scan, CSF examination and follow-up of patients with no SAH during the period between 2 days and 12 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence was 43 per 100 000 inhabitants &gt;18 years of age per year; 11.3% of the patients with TCH had SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings in other patients indicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (five), intracerebral haematoma (three), aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (four), cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> (one) and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus no specific finding indicating the underlying cause of the TCH attack was found in the majority of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A slightly increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> was found in the non-SAH patients (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The attacks occurred in 11 cases (8%) during sexual activity and two of these had an SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo>, neck stiffness, occipital location and impaired consciousness were significantly more frequent with SAH but did not occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Location in the temporal region and pressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> quality were the only features that were more common in non-SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrent attacks of TCH occurred in 24% of the non-SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No SAH occurred later in this group, nor in any of the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that attacks caused by a SAH cannot be distinguished from non-SAH attacks on clinical grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is important that patients with their first TCH attack are investigated with CT and CSF examination to exclude SAH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results from this and previous studies indicate that it is not necessary to perform angiography in patients with a TCH attack, provided that no symptoms or signs indicate a possible brain lesion and a CT scan and CSF examination have not indicated SAH </plain></SENT>
