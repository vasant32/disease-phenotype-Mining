<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the possible role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For inducing CVST in Sprague-Dawley rats, a cranial window was made to expose the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the exposed sinus, a strip of filter paper soaked with 40% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control rats 0.9% saline was used instead of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After induction of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, clinical evaluations were done on days 1, 2 and 7 for neurological deficit, weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and brain lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In neuronal-rich cell preparations flow cytometric estimations were done at different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the study group on sequential follow-up, there was spontaneous recanalization of SSS as well as a significant decrease in brain lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An insignificant improvement in neurological deficit was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the controls, there was no neurological deficit or evidence of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuronal free radical levels were significantly increased in the study group on day 1 compared to controls, but on follow-up free radicals levels decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the free radicals increase in the early stage of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may be important in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
