<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We induced CVST in rat by topical application of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> over the exposed superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and pathological changes were monitored on days 1, 2 and 7 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2 weighted signal changes were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the study group rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2 hyper intensity decreased over the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In study group, the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) was decreased by 31.94% on day 1 compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was 15.5% increase in the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value on day 2 compared to day 1 which reached almost equal to control value on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On histological evaluation, neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and cellular infiltration were observed in cortical region after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The early decrease in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> could be attributed to cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> that precedes vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> indicated by normalization of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and a decreased T2 hyper intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> induced CVST in the rat produces cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in early stage followed by vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> which is related to recanalization of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
