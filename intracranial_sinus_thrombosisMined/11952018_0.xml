<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case is described of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> due to factor V Leiden deficiency that occurred in the neonatal period, presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on ultrasonography, Doppler ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aetiology was only recognized after blood-clotting tests, antithrombin III, C and S protein levels and factor V Leiden were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This situation was treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> controlled by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI angiography and Doppler US were important in the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is important to assess periodically the neurological development of the baby and to prevent situations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, which can precipitate further thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetics allowed the identification of this trait in other family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In every newborn with a thrombotic episode, coagulation studies must be performed, including testing for activated protein C (APC) resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Doppler US flow measurement and the MRI studies provide the best tools for diagnosis and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> should be given to double the initial individual APTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is important to prevent any risk situation such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, which could lead to a recurrence of a thrombotic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regular assessment of the child's neurodevelopment is an important aspect of further care </plain></SENT>
