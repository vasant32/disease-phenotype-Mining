<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Otogenic lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OLST) is almost always associated with other complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> (COM) and did not present a distinct clinical expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our experience, OLST exhibits a benign course if the underlying disease is controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics provided effective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy is no longer used routinely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization is rare and is independent of the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of the clinical aspects and evolution of OLST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study investigated a retrospective case series in a tertiary teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 1993 to 2007, eight cases of OLST were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical and imaging data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from a minimum of 6 months to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients, the lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was detected by imaging studies performed to evaluate complications and symptoms related to COM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve paralysis</z:hpo> were the main clinical manifestations associated with coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, and cerebellar and epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We could not identify features specific to lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent mastoidectomy and were given broad-spectrum antibiotics for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four cases were anticoagulated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight cases experienced complete clinical recovery without sequelae </plain></SENT>
