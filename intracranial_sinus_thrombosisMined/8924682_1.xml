<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We report on our first experience in imaging the cerebral veins and sinuses with CT angiography (CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: CTA was performed in 10 patients after bolus injection of contrast medium to rule out sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 8 of 10 patients <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of cerebral venous sinuses was ruled out by CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was diagnosed and confirmed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 5 cases, diagnosis of CTA was confirmed by MRI and/or DSA, in 5 other cases by the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTA results in detailed information about flow and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of cerebral veins due to high intravascular contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTA is a suitable noninvasive method to study cerebral veins as it is superior to conventional CT because of high resolution and intravascular contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To assess the sensitivity of CTA for diagnosis of venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> a prospective study is needed </plain></SENT>
