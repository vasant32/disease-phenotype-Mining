<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Calvarial remodeling is typically associated with significant blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although preoperative erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have proven to significantly decrease the need for blood transfusions, recent data in adults have raised concerns that elevating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels greater than 12.5 g/dl may increase the risk of thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess the risks of erythropoietin in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records were retrospectively reviewed from 2000 to 2008 at three major metropolitan children's hospitals of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children undergoing calvarial remodeling after receiving preoperative erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and perioperative outcome data were reviewed, including transfusion reactions, pressure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> secondary to prolonged positioning, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 369 patients met the inclusion criteria (mean age, 0.86Â±1.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On average, three preoperative doses of erythropoietin were administered (600 U/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Iron was also supplemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No complications associated with dosing were noted, there were no thrombotic events identified, and no other major complications were seen (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (8.40 percent) experienced one or more postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels greater than 12.5 g/dl and the occurrence of any noted complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With zero thrombotic postoperative complications, the authors estimate the risk of a thrombotic event in the pediatric population to be less than 0.81 percent (95 percent confidence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that preoperative administration of erythropoietin in children undergoing calvarial remodeling does not appear to increase the incidence of thrombotic events or other significant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV </plain></SENT>
