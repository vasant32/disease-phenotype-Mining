<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anticoagulation is effective, the duration of therapy remains speculative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the relationship between sinus recanalisation and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 12 consecutive patients with aseptic CVT with evidence of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on initial magnetic resonance imaging, followed up 5-68 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, using 15 repeat magnetic resonance scans in 9 of the patients to assess recanalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients initially had one or more thrombosed sinuses and were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> for at least 6 months, including 3 with haemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Residual neurological deficits were present in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalisations was incomplete in 6 of the 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sinus recanalisation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> does not correlate with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although empirical, the general recommendation of 6 months <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy is appropriate </plain></SENT>
