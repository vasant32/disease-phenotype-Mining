<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we found the first congenital deficiency of histidine-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (HRG) in a Japanese woman with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the genetic basis of this deficiency, we first performed Southern blot analysis and found no gross deletion or insertion in the proband's HRG gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then examined the nucleotide sequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven exons of the proband's HRG gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single nucleotide substitution, G to A at nucleotide position 429, which mutates Gly85 to Glu in the first cystatin-like domain, was found in exon 3 in 13 of 22 amplified clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mutation generates a unique Taq I site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exon 3 was amplified from the proband, her family members, and 50 unrelated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Japanese individuals, and Taq I fragmentation was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fragmentation of exon 3 was observed in one allele of the genes from the proband and the family members who also have decreased plasma levels of HRG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty unrelated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Japanese individuals had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HRG gene, indicating that the G to A mutation is not a common polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the identified mutation as a cause for the secretion defect of HRG in the proband's plasma, we constructed and transiently expressed the recombinant Tokushima-type HRG mutant (Gly85 to Glu) in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, and examined an intracellular event of the mutant protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed that only about 20% of the Tokushima-type HRG was secreted into the culture medium, and intracellular degradation of the mutant was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study strongly suggests that the HRG deficiency is caused by intracellular degradation of the Gly85 to Glu mutant of HRG in the proband </plain></SENT>
