<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A pattern of decreased intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps is useful in the early detection of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less information exists with regard to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic deficits in whom there is abnormal conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors identified 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic deficits who underwent diffusion MRI and had calculated <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps demonstrating hyper-intensity in regions characterized by computed tomography hypodensity and MRI T2 hyperintensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial and follow-up imaging characteristics and clinical syndromes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical syndromes included hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo>, hyperperfusion following carotid endarterectomy, venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, HIV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was hyperintense in 3 of 13 patients, isointense in 4 of 13 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in 3 of 13 patients, and hypointense in 3 of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in these regions were significantly higher than those in control regions (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At early follow-up, MRI abnormalities resolved completely in 3 of 13 patients and partially in 9 of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI abnormalities were unchanged in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the evaluation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic deficits, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> hyperintensity may identify a subset of patients with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of nonischemic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequently, these conditions are potentially reversible if appropriately managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DWI and conventional images alone are not sufficient to identify these neurologic conditions </plain></SENT>
