<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Direct invasive monitoring of brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) has been routinely utilized to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and to prevent secondary injury in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and vasospasm secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety and utility of these devices in the pediatric population have been examined in a few small studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No studies, however, have examined the use of PbtO(2) monitoring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review of the first two consecutive, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> pediatric patients in the pediatric intensive care unit requiring brain tissue oxygen monitoring for newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICP, CPP, PbtO(2), SaO(2), BP, and RR were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> continually monitored during their care and were retrospectively collected and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We present two pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients managed in a critical care setting with PbtO(2) monitoring in addition to ICP, MAP, CPP, and SaO(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients had multiple events of low brain tissue oxygen (PbtO(2) &lt;20Â torr), independent of abnormal values in other monitoring parameters, which required physician intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No new ischemic damage occurred after PbtO(2) monitoring began in either patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is currently inadequate data to support the application of PbtO(2) monitoring in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to prevent progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and to improve outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the positive results for these two patients support the need for further study in this area </plain></SENT>
