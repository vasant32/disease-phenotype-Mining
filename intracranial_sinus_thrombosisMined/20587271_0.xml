<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of 42 adult patients with DAVFs involving a total of 63 sinuses, three distinctive findings were identified as essential for indication of selective TVE for DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first is extra-sinus fistulous drainage, which is embolizable fistulous drainage, remote from the major dural sinus, that flows into the sinus lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second is intramural fistulous drainage, which is embolizable fistulous drainage located within the dural leafs of the involved sinus and separate from the major sinus lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The third consists of several lumens inside the affected sinuses, which suggests a variety of histological changes in the developmental process of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extra-sinus drainage was occluded in three torcular heroplili <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> and three transverse sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intramural fistulous drainage was eliminated in three superior sagittal sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several lumens inside the affected sinuses were encountered in 17 posterior fossa <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> (68%) and 10 cavernous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These distinctive findings were recognized in 52% of the DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Out of various modalities for treatment of DAVFs, TVE has been the method of choice for the treatment of diffuse DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TVE of DAVFs do not correspond to simple sinus occlusion, but imply selective occlusion of fistulous drainages and sinus lumens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The recognition of these three distinctive types of fistulous drainages have clinical impact in that it helps to completely occlude <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the fistulous components of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> as well as preserve or restore the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venous outflow through the involved sinus </plain></SENT>
