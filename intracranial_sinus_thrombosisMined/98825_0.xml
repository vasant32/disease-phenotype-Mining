<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case, a young woman who, after several years, of cyclic consumption of 4 mg of norethylsterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and 0.05 mg of ethynilestradiol, died from a transtentorial temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> due to severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography, and later autopsy, showed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the dural venous sinuses and also of the majority of the emissary veins with C.S.F. blockage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second case, a patient who took 1 mg of norethyndrone and 0.05 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6784">mestranol</z:chebi> for 20 months, developed a focal symptomatology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014549,C0494475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">Grand Mal</z:e>, global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> without lowering of the level of conscionsness) which cleared up rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CAT performed during the clinical illness showed mild signs of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> while cerebral angiography <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It seems possible that the hormonal treatment may disturb the mechanisms of C.S.F. production-reabsorbtion and the filtration dynamics of the blood-brain barrier and perhaps, cause alteration of hypothalamic-hypophysial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This would explain a transitory symptomatology, such as benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the venous sinuses (sometimes, as in our first case, massive) may be due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e>, that accompanies intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and to the altered blood coagulation </plain></SENT>
