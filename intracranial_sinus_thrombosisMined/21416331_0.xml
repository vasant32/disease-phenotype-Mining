<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging data suggest that neurologic involvement in BD presents in two major forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) parenchymal involvement with a predilection to brainstem-diencephalic regions, is seen in the majority of patients with neuro-BD (NBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second form is cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST), which is seen in up to 20% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BD is very rare in children, but when it does occur, the patterns are reversed: most children with NBD present with CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other syndromes such as spinal cord involvement, arterial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>, aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo> may be seen, but are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD has a significantly better neurologic prognosis than parenchymal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is no Class I evidence regarding treatment of parenchymal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement or CVST in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current treatment applications are based largely on expert opinion; none are evidence-based </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> parenchymal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement should be treated with high-dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (IVMP), 1 g per day, for 5 to 10 days, followed by either a prolonged oral taper or intermittent IVMP pulses with a low oral dose between the pulses, over 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack, long-term maintenance with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> should be considered in patients with parenchymal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, as this form may follow a relapsing or secondary progressive course and may result in significant physical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> leading to severe neurologic disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A number of randomized controlled studies have tested treatments for systemic manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> was found to be effective for mucocutaneous symptoms, thalidomide was found to be effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were shown to be effective in BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> was shown to be effective for major vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More recently, interferon alfa and anti-TNF agents were also shown to be effective in BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although randomized controlled studies have not been performed in NBD, the most widely used long-term therapeutic agent is <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recent observations suggest that the addition and long-term use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> in NBD could be associated with a more favorable course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A growing number of case reports in recent years suggest that anti-TNF agents may be an effective alternative in NBD, but current experience with these agents is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CVST in BD is also treated with steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The addition to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> of anticoagulation, including short-term fractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, is controversial, as these patients have a higher probability of harboring pulmonary or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which may be associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Long-term oral anticoagulation is unnecessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the prognosis of CVST due to BD seems to be much more favorable than the prognosis of CVST due to other causes, with much less tendency for venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, as recurrences may occur, long-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> is recommended </plain></SENT>
