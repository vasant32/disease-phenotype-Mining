<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We present here the first report of a jugular bulb <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> after mild head injury, which lacked either a skull fracture or abnormal findings on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old boy was hit on the back of the head and experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> beginning the next morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A CT scan and cranial x-ray examination failed to reveal any abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated conservatively; however, his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 13 days after the injury, he began to show <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo> due to left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VIth nerve palsy</z:e> and bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedemas</z:e>, suggesting an increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although repeated CT scan failed to detect abnormal findings in both the supra- and infra-tentorial regions, MRI clearly visualized a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> which was situated within the right jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MRV demonstrated disruption of venous flow at the jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was administered <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>His symptoms improved and the CSF pressure on lumbar puncture returned to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level at 20 days after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed resolution of the clot, and MRV appeared to demonstrate partial recanalization simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged without any neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clot in the jugular bulb disappeared completely after 4 months, and he could be followed up for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case underscores the fact that MRI may represent the exclusive screening examination in cases of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when it occurs within the jugular bulb, as CT scan fails to reveal any findings suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
