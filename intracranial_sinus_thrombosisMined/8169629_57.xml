<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has been hypothesized as a possible cause of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (AVF's) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis and evolution from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> to actual development of an AVF are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study dural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> formation, a surgically induced venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> model in rats was created by producing an arteriovenous shunt between the carotid artery and the external jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The external jugular vein beyond the anastomosis was ligated 2 to 3 months after surgery and angiography was performed to identify any new acquired AVF's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats, each weighing approximately 300 gm, were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Group I, 22 rats underwent a common carotid artery anastomosis to the external jugular vein, which is the largest draining vein from the transverse sinus via the posterior facial vein, followed by proximal external jugular vein ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group II, 13 rats underwent the same surgical procedure, followed by contralateral posterior facial vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group III served as the control group, in which 11 rats underwent only unilateral external jugular vein occlusion with or without contralateral posterior facial vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The shunts in Groups I and II were ligated at 2 to 3 months following surgery, and transfemoral angiography was performed immediately before and after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New acquired AVF's had developed in three rats (13.6%) in Group I, three rats (23.1%) in Group II, and no rats (0%) in Group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of these newly formed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> was located at the dural sinus, analogous to the human dural AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other five were located in the subcutaneous tissue, including the face and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The dural AVF in the rat was present on follow-up angiography at 1 week after the bypass occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of 2 to 3 months' duration, without associated venous or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, can induce new AVF's affecting the dural sinuses or the subcutaneous tissue </plain></SENT>
