<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Outcome from sinus vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is very variable, with symptoms from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental findings suggest that an involvement of cortical veins is necessary to affect the cerebral microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to investigate the regional and temporal changes in local cortical blood flow after experimental occlusion and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus and tributary cortical veins in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by slow injection of kaolin-cephalin suspension after frontal and caudal ligation of the sagittal sinus in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and correlated with parenchymal damage found 24 hours after induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local cerebral blood flow 1 hour after sinus occlusion and induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had decreased to 60.92 +/- 29.05% (p &lt; 0.01); however, there was a large variability among individual animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only five of 12 rats showed histological damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> 24 hours after induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis revealed that parenchymal damage occurred in concurrence with reduced blood flow values after sinus ligation and injection of the thrombogenic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> alone, without alteration of blood flow, did not cause tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data support the contention that sinus vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> evolves gradually, with major symptoms occurring only if the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> expands from the sinus into bridging and cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collateral venous outflow pathways are thereby occluded, and local blood flow may become reduced to and below the ischemic threshold </plain></SENT>
