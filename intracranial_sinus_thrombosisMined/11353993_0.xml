<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the veins and venous sinuses is an uncommon condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1947 it was described in adults by Garcin and Pestel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is a potentially serious disorder, in which there is severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> which may be fatal or cause serious neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is made, during life, on the clinical condition and neuro-imaging features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We consider that treatment of the underlying condition is essential to improve prognosis, although this is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Cuba there are no publications reporting series of patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASES: We present five patients, four of whom were women, with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> involving focal neurological deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and with <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> in 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of imaging studies were compatible with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of veins and/or venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was conformed at necropsy in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The commonest risk factor was the puerperium, occurring in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated symptomatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The other patients made good progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The puerperium is the commonest risk factor in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the venous sinuses and the veins draining into them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo>, neurological focal signs and level of consciousness are the main symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo>, haemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> are of bad prognosis and followed by unsatisfactory progress of the disorder </plain></SENT>
