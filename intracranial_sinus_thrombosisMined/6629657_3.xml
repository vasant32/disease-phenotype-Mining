<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondarily to cranial and intracranial invasion the following complications may occur: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo>, cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, extradural, subdural and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proximity of the frontal sinus to both the dura and the marrow of the frontal bone, as well as a rich communicating venous system, lends support to the facility of intracranial extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Classically, frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> presents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or pain usually following an upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purulent nasal discharge may be noted on physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Roentgenographic studies will show opacification or an air-fluid level within the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present 4 cases of intracranial complications of frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> seen in male adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is our contention that this disease bears a notable preponderance in males; a postulation that appears to be substantiated in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequently even the classic signs and symptoms of frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> may be undetected, which indicates that certainly the more subtle presentation of this disease may escape diagnosis during the course of examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of CT scanning has proved an invaluable tool in the diagnosis of both frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> and intracranial involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The importance of its incorporation into the diagnostic workup of the patient with frontal sinus disease cannot be overemphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We advocate aggressive medical and surgical management for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adolescents presenting with frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> in an attempt to avoid possible intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
