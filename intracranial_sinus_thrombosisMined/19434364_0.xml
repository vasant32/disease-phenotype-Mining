<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report a rare case of small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> originating from the right cavernous sinus in a 55-year-old male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0011349'>abducens palsy</z:hpo> following right oculomotor palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Post-contrast T1-weighted MRI revealed a mass lesion of 3-cm maximum size occupying the right cavernous sinus and extending to the right middle cranial fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After biopsy via the frontozygomatic approach, one radiosurgery treatment was followed by four cycles of chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> together with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> therapy), after which the lesion diminished dramatically in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission has currently been achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered from the extraocular muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> and returned to his previous work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it is considered possible that small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> can occur wherever neuroendocrine cells exist, a lesion originating in the cranium is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of intracranial origin </plain></SENT>
