<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a rare intracranial complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> that is traditionally described in countries with poor access to medical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to describe the clinical presentation, management, and outcome of patients diagnosed with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a US tertiary care center and to highlight the clinically relevant differences in presentation between these patients and those described in previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical charts of 13 patients diagnosed with otogenic lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were identified from a manual search of 156 subjects with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes corresponding with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> over a 10-year period (1997-2007) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In contrast to previous reports in the literature, the majority of patients in this series exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathies</z:e> and signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> treated with antibiotics in the weeks preceding admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, many patients denied high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> or active otomastoid symptoms, which are classically associated with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the children by using computed tomography and MRI/venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategies included myringotomy tube placement, simple mastoidectomy, intravenous antibiotics, and anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Posthospitalization follow-up data revealed no significant long-term complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and other intracranial complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> are still a threat to children in the modern era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurologic, rather than otologic, symptoms may dominate the presentation of otogenic lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, a high index of suspicion may be critical for ensuring timely diagnosis of this rare condition </plain></SENT>
