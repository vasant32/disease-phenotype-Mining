<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial to examine whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment improves outcome in patients with sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized between body weight-adjusted subcutaneous nadroparin (180 anti-factor Xa units/kg per 24 hours) and matching placebo for 3 weeks (double-blind part of trial), followed by 3 months of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> for patients allocated nadroparin (open part) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> caused by sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled, and none were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient the diagnosis proved wrong after randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3 weeks, 6 of 30 patients (20%) in the nadroparin group and 7 of 29 patients (24%) in the placebo group had a poor outcome, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or Barthel Index score of &lt;15 (risk difference, -4%; 95% CI, -25 to 17%; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, 4 of 30 patients (13%) in the nadroparin group and 6 of 29 (21%) in the placebo group had a poor outcome, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or Oxford Handicap Score of &gt;/=3 (risk difference, -7%; 95% CI, -26% to 12%; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no new symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient in the nadroparin group had a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 1 patient in the placebo group died from clinically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> followed by oral anticoagulation) had a favorable outcome more often than controls, but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation proved to be safe, even in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
