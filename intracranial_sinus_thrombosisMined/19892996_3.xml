<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> are important consequences of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to define the role of the protein C pathway in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> elicited by experimental CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of neutrophil recruitment was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, leukocyte-endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (LECA) and inflammatory cytokine levels were monitored in a murine model of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of activated protein C (APC) was assessed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice (WT) receiving APC neutralizing antibody and in endothelial protein C receptor overexpressing mice (EPCR-tg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil involvement was evaluated using an anti-CD18 antibody (Ab) and antineutrophil serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> and increases in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and LECA were noted 48 hours after CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APC immunoblockade exacerbated these responses, while EPCR-tg exhibited blunted responses, as did WT treated with either antineutrophil serum or the CD18 Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The protein C pathway protects the brain against the deleterious microvascular responses to CVST, a response that appears to be linked to the recruitment of inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
