<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, the need for CT scans in such patients has been questioned owing to concerns regarding long-term effects of brain irradiation, with some clinicians claiming that the decision to scan should be based on a patient's clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at characterizing the typical clinical presentation of patients who already have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> when diagnosed with AM, and to compare it to that of AM patients presenting without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients hospitalized with AM between July 1997 and December 2009 in an otologic tertiary referral center were divided into those with and those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> on presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prereferral clinical characteristics and the signs, symptoms, and inflammatory indexes at presentation were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 71 patients presenting with AM, 10 had at least one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> (sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> [nine patients], perisinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath> [five patients], subdural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> [one patient], and epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> [one patient]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> did not differ regarding most clinical characteristics or presenting signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None presented with neurological signs or cranial nerve deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to define an evidence-based index of suspicion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> in patients with AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic imaging at presentation accordingly remains mandatory </plain></SENT>
