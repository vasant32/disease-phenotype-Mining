<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the same model, changes in cerebral metabolism at the site of r-CBF measurement were observed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases were classified according to occlusion site: group SSS [occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) only], group LS[occlusion of SSS plus lateral sinus (LS)] and group CV[SSS and LS plus cortical veins (CV)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In groups SSS and LS, SSSP changed very little up to 6 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group LS, r-CBF decreased slightly, but the change was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an increase in SSSP and decrease in r-CBF were observed in group CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">Phosphorus</z:chebi> MRS also demonstrated a decrease in phosphocreatinine (PCr) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) and increase in inorganic <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>) following occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of group CV revealed dramatic changes, including the development of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimental application of the proposed model revealed that widespread occlusion of the sinuses can cause an increase in intravenous pressure with a concomitant decrease in r-CBF, resulting in metabolic complications such as a decrease in PCr and ATP and an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
