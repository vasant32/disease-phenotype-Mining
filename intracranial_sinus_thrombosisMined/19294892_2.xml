<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dural sinus malformation (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>) is a term used to describe congenital vascular malformations characterized by massive dilation of one or more dural sinuses: these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> are typically associated with arteriovenous shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such malformations can present antenatally but their early natural history and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> is poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed five years of autopsy experience and retrieved three primary vascular malformations of the fetal dural sinuses with ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and post-mortem correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fetal ultrasound and MRI obtained between 19 and 23 weeks gestational age demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases dilation of the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two cases vascular thromboses were present in either the dilated dural sinus (one of three) or the associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (one of three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were autopsied at 22-23 weeks gestational age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one there was imaging and autopsy evidence of remodeling of the dural sinuses associated with a pial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two cases, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> was identified on initial imaging, but only became evident at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One case showed morphological overlap with vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation, with a midline arteriovenous shunt and vein of Galen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other demonstrated a perisylvian dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In utero <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of feeding vascular malformations or of the dural sinus malformation may be prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The early in utero developmental trajectory of dural sinus malformation (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>) is poorly defined and deserves further study </plain></SENT>
