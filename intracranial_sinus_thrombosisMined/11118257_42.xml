<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors to predict outcome in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of CVST have not been analysed in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors in patients enrolled in a clinical treatment trial were prospectively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome after 12 weeks, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency (Oxford handicap score &gt; or =3), was used as the principle outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate relations between possible prognostic factors and outcome at 12 weeks were analyzed with chi(2) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> factors associated with prognosis (p&lt; or = 0.25) were forced into a logistic regression model with a forward selection procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty nine patients (50 women, nine men) were studied, with a mean age of 37 years (range 18 to 80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks 10 patients (17%) had a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The univariate identified factors related to poor outcome were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e>, altered consciousness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, age older than 33 years, diagnostic delay &lt; or =10 days, intracerebral haemorrhage, and involvement of the straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and a delta sign on CT were associated with good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and cerebral haemorrhage were significantly associated with a poor outcome, with odds ratios of 8.2 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>3-50.1) and 20.7 (95% CI 1.6-264.3) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the straight sinus was also weakly, but not significantly, associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and intracerebral haemorrhage are independent predictors for poor outcome of CVST </plain></SENT>
