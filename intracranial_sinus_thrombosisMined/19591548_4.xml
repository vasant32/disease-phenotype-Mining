<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors conducted a study to determine the safety and efficacy of embolization of carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> (CCFs) with the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi> vinyl alcohol <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>, Onyx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: They prospectively collected data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CCFs who underwent Onyx-based embolization at their institution over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, route of embolization, viscosity of Onyx, additional use of coils, extent of embolization, procedural complications, and clinical follow-up were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 12 patients (5 men and 7 women who were age 24-88 years) underwent embolization in which Onyx was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 1 Barrow Type A, 1 Type B, 3 Type C, and 7 Type D <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolization was performed via a transvenous route in 8 cases and a transarterial route in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Onyx 34 was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 cases: a direct Type A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> embolized with Onyx 500 and an indirect Type C <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> embolized with Onyx 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant embolization with framing coils was performed in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were completed in a single session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> obliteration was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical resolution of presenting symptoms occurred in 100% of the patients by 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurological complications occurred in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a complete cranial nerve <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> VII palsy that has not resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathies</z:e>--1 a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> and partial CN VI palsy, and 1 a complete CN III and partial CN V palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Radiographic follow-up (mean 16 months, range 4-35 months) was available in 6 patients with complete resolution of the lesion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Onyx is a liquid embolic agent that is effective in the treatment of CCFs but not without hazards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Postembolization cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and swelling may result in transient compressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The inherent gradual polymerization properties of Onyx allow for casting of the cavernous sinus but may potentially result in deep penetration within arterial collaterals that can cause CN <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although not proven, the angiotoxic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> may also play a role in postembolization CN deficits </plain></SENT>
