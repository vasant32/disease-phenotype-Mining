<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the etiology, type and predictors of outcome of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from Northern India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 79 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients aged 1month to 18years managed during 2001-2011 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 144.8months (0.6-18years) and 26 were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed history including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical, imaging and laboratory findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was classified as per neuroimaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were evaluated by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 62 (78.5%) patients had arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS), 10 (12.7%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) and 7 (8.9%) had cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The underlying etiology was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0870953" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuroinfections</z:e> in 25, cardioembolic in 9, prothrombotic conditions in 5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> in 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> in 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> cytopathy and cervical rib in 1 each and cryptogenic in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>7 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was related to level of consciousness on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AIS is more common than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in this study and 8.9% patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> is the most common cause of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Northern India which is amenable to therapy and is preventable </plain></SENT>
