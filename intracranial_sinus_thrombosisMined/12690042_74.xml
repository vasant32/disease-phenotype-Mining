<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analysed 87 consecutive cases who were treated in our department between 1984 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>Meningitis</z:hpo>-associated intracranial complications developed in 74.7% and systemic complications in 37.9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> (28.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (16.1%) developed more frequently than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of arterial (21.8%) and venous (9.2%) cerebrovascular complications were also very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 9.2% of cases developed spontaneous intracranial haemorrhages (two patients with subarachnoid and two with subarachnoid and <z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>intracerebral bleedings</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>; one subject with intracerebral haemorrhage due to sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; and three cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>intracerebral bleedings</z:mp> of unknown aetiology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other new findings were the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spinal cord dysfunction due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelitis</z:e> (2.3%) and that of hearing loss (19.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 25.8% of survivors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality was 24.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 48.3% of the patients had a good outcome at discharge [Glasgow Outcome Scale Score (GOS) = 5] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome did not change during the study period, as mortality and GOS were similar for patients treated between 1984 and 1992 and for those treated between 1993 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with a bad outcome (GOS &lt;/= 4) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> debilitating diseases, low Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale Score and focal neurological deficits on admission, low CSF leucocyte counts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteraemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>-associated intracranial and systemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low CSF leucocyte counts were also associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>-associated intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; or =60 years was associated with a higher mortality (36.7 versus 17.5%), but the GOS of the survivors was comparable to that of the surviving younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were mostly systemic complications in the elderly and cerebral complications in the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A haematogenous pathogenesis seemed likely in asplenic patients, while contiguous spread from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029877" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">otitis</z:e> was the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in non-asplenic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, asplenic patients had a raised incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>-associated intracranial complications, but their outcome was similar to that of non-asplenic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The morbidity and mortality of pneumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in adults are still devastating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We report higher incidences (diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular complications) or new incidences (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelitis</z:e>, hearing loss, subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) of intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our detailed analysis of prognostic factors may help clinicians to identify patients at risk and may also be helpful in the design of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
