<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We present the case of a pregnant female diagnosed with dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by serial time-of-flight (TOF) MRV examinations, and treated with long-term anticoagulation based on these examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The appearance of the affected dural sinus did not change on MRV over the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient returned during follow-up with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo>, which prompted us to perform DSA to exclude a dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DSA revealed that the segment of venous sinus diagnosed as thrombosed on MRV actually was patent but had a septation in its midsection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the patient did not have a venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at the time of MRV examinations but rather an anatomical variant mimicking a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which would not have required any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRV, particularly TOF MRV, is limited by artifacts in correctly identifying vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and pathology and should be interpreted carefully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DSA remains the reference standard for most vascular imaging </plain></SENT>
