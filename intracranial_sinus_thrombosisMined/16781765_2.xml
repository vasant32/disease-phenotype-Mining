<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphisms involving coagulation factors are considered to be risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recently identified polymorphism in factor V gene, A4070G (R2 allele), has been reported as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in some studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the R2 allele has been reported to increase factor V Leiden-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk in doubly heterozygous individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk associated with the R2 allele has not yet been evaluated in CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the prevalence of factor V A4070G mutation in Indians and examine its role as a possible risk factor for CVT occurring during puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 50 patients with puerperal CVT and 100 healthy women with no post-partum complications for factor V A4070G and G1691A (factor V Leiden) polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Among cases, 6 (12%) were heterozygous for the factor V A4070G mutation and none were homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 9 (9%) were heterozygous and 3 (3%) were homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.31-3.13, p=1.000), suggesting that the risk for CVT was not increased in the presence of the R2 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no co-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of factor V A4070G with factor V G1691A in any of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that the A4070G mutation in factor V though highly prevalent in the Indian population is not associated with an increased risk of CVT occurring during puerperium in Indian women </plain></SENT>
