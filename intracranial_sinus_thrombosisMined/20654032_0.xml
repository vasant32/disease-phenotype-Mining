<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of urokinase and low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> complicated with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Urokinase and low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were administered to the 5 patients intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial dose of urokinase was 2000 - 4000 U/(kg.d), the initial pulse dose was 20 000 - 40 000 U given within 15 - 30 minutes, and the left was infused by using a pump, from the second day 2000 U/(kg.d) urokinase was infused daily for 3 to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the treatment thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were tested 3 times every week, with particular attention to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> 100 - 120 AXaIU/kg, 1 or 2 times per day was hypodermally injected for a course of two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-platelet drugs: long-term oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> 3 - 5 mg/(kg.d) was applied 2 - 3 times every day for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical symptoms disappeared after one month of the combined therapy of urokinase, low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> in 5 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> complicated with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in children, the plasma viscosity returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 1 month, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, fibrinogen degradation products returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 1 to 2 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> disappeared after 1 to 3 months in head CT or MRI examination, showing the cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> complete recanalization without relapse cases in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The early application of urokinase and low molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and anti-platelet coagulation drugs was effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of intracranial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> is important </plain></SENT>
