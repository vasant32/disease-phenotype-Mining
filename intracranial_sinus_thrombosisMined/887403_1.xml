<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report 4 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior longitudinal sinus (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="8984">SLS</z:chebi>) in women taking oestroprogestational agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This complication is very rare, only 25 cases existing in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture consists of premonitory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> associated with neurological signs suggesting lesions affecting both hemispheres in alternation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of treatment, sudden deterioration on about the tenth day is to be feared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This picture is similar to that of puerperal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="8984">SLS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis should be confirmed by carotid arteriography, which demonstrates the presence of collateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> and the thrombosed sinus giving a "negative" image on the AP view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral scintigraphy shows one or more areas of uptake in the form of adjacent rounded shapes, corresponding to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> of venous origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As far as the responsibility of oestro-progenstational agents is concerned, the role is suggested by the analogy with puerperal thromboses and also by the absence of cases in men (with the exception of head injury, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> of the face and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis is grave (19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> out of 29 cases), but surviving patients are completely cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This prognosis would seem to be essentially dependent upon the possibilities of venous callateral circulation, which are variable in each individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">Anticoagulants</z:chebi> and thrombolytic risk, in effective doses, to transform the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> into a cerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment consists rather of methods to reduce cerebral volume, aimed at maximal use of collateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> and assisting the patient to overcome to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the first 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> would seem to be the principal presenting symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, no biological test gives a reliable indication as to those women most at risk and contraindictions are in fact of a clinical character </plain></SENT>
