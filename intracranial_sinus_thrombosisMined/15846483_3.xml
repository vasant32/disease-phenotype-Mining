<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective study was carried out on 41 patients referred to our Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unit with clinical findings suggestive of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced 3D turbo-flash and 2D TOF MRA sequences were performed, and the dural sinuses and cerebral veins were classified into five grades according to the quality of visualization and presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found the dural sinuses and cerebral veins to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequences in 31 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of dural sinuses was detected in ten patients, with four of these ten cases found only in the contrast-enhanced 3D turbo-flash sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, complete visualization of cerebral veins and dural sinuses was significantly better accomplished with contrast-enhanced 3D turbo-flash MRA than with 2D TOF in either coronal or sagittal/oblique planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although 2D TOF MRA may be superior in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, contrast-enhanced 3D turbo-flash MRA sequences may offer advantages for the early diagnosis and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
