<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Consumption of oral contraceptive pills (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e>) is a known risk factor for cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether misuse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> could increase the risk of CVST in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was conducted from 2003 to 2007 on 64 female patients with CVST admitted to Al- Zahra medical center and 232 healthy age-matched female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> users as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and controls were interviewed and misuse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> was categorized to taking <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> for self-treatment of dysfunctional uterine <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, for family planning without physician consult, or for delaying menstruation in purpose of religious customs or traveling, and taking <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> in high dose during the preceding year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 64 cases and 232 controls, 30 (46.9 %) and 63 (27.2 %), respectively, had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> misuse (Odds Ratio = 2.36, 95% Confidence Intervals = 1.33 to 4.18, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50742">cyproterone</z:chebi> compound (Diane) was more frequent in the CVST group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis controlling for age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> misuse, type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e>, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> misuse (P&lt;0.001) and using Diane as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> (P = 0.006) were both independently associated with CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> misuse can be considered as an additional predisposing factor for CVST among women and partly responsible for larger proportion of female patients with CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings should alarm the healthcare system to create strategies controlling the inappropriate use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCP</z:e> among Iranian women </plain></SENT>
