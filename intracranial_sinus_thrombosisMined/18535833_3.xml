<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the charts of five patients (1 male and 4 female) with LST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chief complaints were otalgia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, mastoid tenderness, and neck pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were confirmatively diagnosed with MRI-Venography or Angio-CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with appropriate antibiotics and operations including mastoidectomies with/without thrombectomy according to their suspected disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors did not perform IJV ligation and use <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, but there were no mortalities or morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IJV ligation and use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> do not seem to be essential procedures for the management of LST, and it should be considered carefully according to the extents of disease and the state of patients </plain></SENT>
