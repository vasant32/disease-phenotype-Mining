<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI patterns above and below the inferior olivary nucleus enabled identification of six topographical types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>: small midlateral, dorsolateral, inferolateral, large inferodorsolateral, dorsal and paramedian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small midlateral, dorsolateral, inferolateral and inferodorsolateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were the most common types and were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, with specific clusters and severity of neurological features in each of the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dorsal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were both anatomically and clinically overshadowed by a constant associated cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paramedian infarction led to crossed tongue and sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, while a patient with an almost complete hemimedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had unusual ipsilateral sensory and motor disturbance due to lesion extension toward the upper spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A coexisting cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was present in 36% of the cases, but was never found with midlateral or inferolateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed an embolic occlusion of the PICA in five patients (18%), four of them having dorsal or dorsolateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>Atheromatosis</z:hpo> was by far the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> aetiology (72%), with intracranial vertebral artery tight stenosis or occlusion in 28% of the cases and in 75% of the cases with large inferodorsolateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vertebral artery dissection</z:e> and cardioembolism accounted each for 14% of the cases, the latter being associated with dorsal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that differences in topographical patterns of infarction in the lower brainstem probably reflect differences in aetiopathogenic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
