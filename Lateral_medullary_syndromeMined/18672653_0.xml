<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) has become a useful tool to assess the saccule and inferior vestibular nerve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vestibulopathies involving the saccule or inferior vestibular nerve typically result in VEMP responses that are diminished or absent on the involved side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormally large VEMPs are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large VEMPs have been associated with superior canal dehiscence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ménière's disease</z:e>, and labyrinthine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases, the abnormally large VEMP can be explained on the basis of labyrinthine hydromechanical changes that result in excessive saccular displacement in response to intense sound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, a case is presented of a 74-year-old male with dorsal lateral medullary infarction (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>) who presented with an enlarged VEMP--a finding that has not been reported to date as a result of a brain stem lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Particularly perplexing, the enlarged VEMP was on the contralesional side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A proposed mechanism of contralateral vestibular nuclei <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> secondary to the brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
