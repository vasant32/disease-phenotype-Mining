<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three patients with the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unilateral ischemic infarctions, which included the vestibular nucleus in the medullary brain stem and afferent vestibular pathways, were examined by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) during caloric vestibular stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had typical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001751'>vestibular dysfunction</z:hpo> such as transient rotatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, ipsiversive body and ocular lateropulsion, and a complete ocular tilt reaction with tilts of the subjective visual vertical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with healthy volunteers, who show activation in a network of temporoparietal vestibular areas within both hemispheres, especially in the posterior insula and retroinsular region that contains the human homologue of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC) in monkeys, the activation pattern of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> was typically changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During caloric irrigation of the ear ipsilateral to the side of the lesion, they showed no or significantly reduced activation in the contralateral hemisphere, whereas the activation pattern in the ipsilateral hemisphere appeared "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>." These results are compatible with bilateral ascending vestibular pathways from the vestibular nuclei to the vestibular cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The novel finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients was that the activation patterns were compatible with the assumption that only the crossing fibers from the medial vestibular subnucleus to the contralateral medial longitudinal fascicle were affected, but the ipsilateral vestibular thalamocortical projections via the superior vestibular subnucleus were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the activation pattern in the PET study may reflect the vestibular tonic imbalance within the vestibular nuclei circuitry at the cortical level </plain></SENT>
