<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, because of disorders of vital functions, the authors convened artificial lung ventilation which permitted to prolong the life of the patient and to study the dynamics of the EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 10 lethal cases the brain stem was studied on a series of continuous preparations to determine the degree of lesions in the nuclei of the reticular formation in the pons Varoli and medulla oblongata in ischemic foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to establish significant differences in the indices of bioelectric brain activity in lesions of reticular nuclei of pons Varoli and medulla oblongata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors stress the necessitity of reconsidering the existing concepts of a dependence of EEG changed parameters upon the localization of the focus in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
