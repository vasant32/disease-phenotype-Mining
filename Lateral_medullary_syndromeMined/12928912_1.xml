<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the Babinski-Nageotte's syndrome is the classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem syndrome</z:e> that corresponds to hemimedullary lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we compare clinical symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of two patients exhibiting classical Babinski-Nageotte's syndrome according to the original description with symptoms and MRI data of a patient with clinically complete hemimedullary lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that Babinski-Nageotte's syndrome is neither clinically nor on MRI identical with hemimedullary lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypoglossal palsy, an invariable symptom of hemimedullary syndrome, is not part of the Babinski-Nageotte's syndrome according to the original description </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the original historical report, Babinski- Nageotte's syndrome is a lateral "Wallenbergian" medullary lesion with a spreading of the lesion to the more basal localised pyramidal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of the hemimedullary syndrome, described in 1894 by Reinhold, and the MRI appearances in our patient with this syndrome are clearly different from other classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem syndromes</z:e> and should be called Reinhold's syndrome </plain></SENT>
