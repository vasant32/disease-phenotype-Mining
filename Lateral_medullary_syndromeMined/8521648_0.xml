<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He noticed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002317'>unsteady gait</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> approximately 6 hours after the accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the next day he was admitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, and pharyngeal and palatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0007256'>pyramidal tract signs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He could not balance on his right foot or gait tandemly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensation for cold and pin-prick was absent on his left limbs; position sense was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated an occlusion of the right vertebral artery at the 3rd segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cranial MRI demonstrated an infarction in the right lateral medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A radiogram demonstrated an atlanto-axial instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was an anomalous bone mass between the left superior articular process and the odontoid process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities might have precipitated injury of the vertebral artery during the minor neck trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of molecular markers for coagulation and fibrinolysis were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 levels were high, suggesting activated platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To my knowledge, this is the first report showing evidence for platelet activation at the molecular level early in the course of vertebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> following a minor neck trauma </plain></SENT>
