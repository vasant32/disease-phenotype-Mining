<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We evaluated the use of Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMPs) in the assessment of neural function, following medullary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 54-year-old male presented with symptoms and signs typical of right lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He underwent brain MRI and three successive neurophysiological investigations, which included VEMPs, Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BAERs) and the blink reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEMPs amplitude on the left (unaffected) side was 256.8 microv in the first investigation and remained approximately equal to that value in the following two ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their amplitude on the right (affected) side was 37.9 microv, 154.2 microv and 235.2 microv correspondingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> gradually improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Right blink reflex comprised a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> R1, but delayed R2 ipsilateral and R2 contralateral responses, which remained unaltered during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI disclosed a right dorsolateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VEMPs amplitude progressively increased, parallel to the improvement of vestibular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The blink reflex evolved differently, while BAERs were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As the three evoked responses are mediated by separate neural circuits, they provide information on different aspects of brainstem function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, VEMPs seem to be a useful method that complements existing ones in the assessment of brainstem lesions </plain></SENT>
