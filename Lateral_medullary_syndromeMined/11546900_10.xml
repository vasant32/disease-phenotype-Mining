<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> (WS) that are due to lateral medullary infarction (LMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with WS were evaluated by means of clinical and electrophysiological methods that measured the oropharyngeal phase of voluntarily initiated swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 22 patients with unilateral hemispheric infarction were investigated during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 4 patients with unilateral peripheral 9th and 10th <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-matched 30 healthy control subjects were also included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was clinically more severe in WS patients than in the patients in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pharyngeal phase of swallowing was predominantly impaired, whereas in patients with hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was related only to the delay of triggering of the voluntarily induced swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In WS patients, the swallowing reflex was extremely slow in spite of the unilateral involvement due to LMI, whereas the pharyngeal phase of reflex swallowing remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in patients with unilateral hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and patients with unilateral peripheral 9th and 10th <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although in WS the lesion due to LMI is unilateral, its effect on oropharyngeal swallowing is bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In LMI, primarily the premotor neurons in the nucleus ambiguous and their connections seem to be affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, a disruption and/or disconnection of their linkage to swallowing-related cranial motor neuron pools bilaterally and to the contralateral nucleus ambiguous could produce the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e> in WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the remaining intact ipsilateral premotor neurons and the contralateral center in the medulla oblongata may eventually begin to operate and overcome the severity and long-term persistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
