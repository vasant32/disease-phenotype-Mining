<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Background factors, neurologic signs and symptoms, imaging findings, cause of disease, and outcomes were assessed for patients with lateral and those with medial medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Examination of the clinical symptoms and neurologic findings suggested that among patients with medial medullary infarction, few demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the symptoms of Dejerine syndrome at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and many had lesions that were difficult to locate based only on neurologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both lateral and medial medullary infarction were frequently caused by atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> was observed in 31% of patients with lateral medullary infarction and 12.5% of those with medial medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 13% of patients with lateral and 37% of patients with medial medullary infarction, magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted images on the day of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> did not show abnormalities, and the second set of diffusion-weighted images confirmed infarction lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For lateral medullary infarction, a more rostral lesion location was correlated with a poorer 90-day outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For medial medullary infarction, a more dorsal lesion location was correlated with a poorer 90-day outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis rate of medullary infarction using imaging examinations at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>--particularly medial medullary infarction--is not necessarily high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The imaging examinations need to be repeated for patients who are suspected to have medullary infarction based on neurologic signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
