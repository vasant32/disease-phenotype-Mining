<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effect of head rotation on the mechanics of swallowing in healthy subjects, as well as the effects of this postural change on the oropharyngeal swallow of five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> (LMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Videofluoroscopic studies of swallowing in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects revealed that head rotation to either side increased upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening diameter by an average of 2mm without affecting the period of UES opening or the oropharyngeal transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maximal rotation of the head to the right or left caused the bolus to lateralize away from the direction of rotation, and also caused a significant (18mmHg or 35%) fall in UES pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the face forward position, the LMS patients exhibited <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> residue in the pharynx and pyriform sinuses, as well as diminished UES opening diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fraction of the bolus swallowed and the UES opening diameter increased significantly with the head turned toward the paretic side in the LMS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that head rotation can improve swallowing in patients with unilateral oropharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two potentially beneficial effects were observed: (1) functional exclusion of the relatively flaccid, weakened pharyngeal wall, and (2) reduced UES tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Which of these mechanisms is operative probably depends on the dominant mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In individuals with substantial impairment of UES opening, head turning reduces the resistance of the sphincter that must be overcome by pharyngeal contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In individuals with a flaccid hemipharynx, which dissipates pharyngeal pressure, head rotation excludes these structures from the bolus path and allows pharyngeal pressure to be directed at the UES </plain></SENT>
