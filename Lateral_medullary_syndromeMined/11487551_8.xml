<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CPG serially activates the cranial nerve motor neurons, including the nucleus ambiguus and vagal dorsal motor nucleus, which then innervate the muscles of deglutition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case provides insight into the central control of swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 65-year-old man with a right superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> presented with a constellation of symptoms, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The swallow was characterized using videofluoroscopy and esophageal motility and the results were compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Videofluoroscopy showed intact lingual propulsion and volitional movements of the larynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distal pharyngeal peristalsis was absent, and the bolus did not pass the upper esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Manometry showed proximal pharyngeal contraction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peristaltic activity in the lower esophagus (smooth muscle), but motor activity of the upper esophageal sphincter and proximal esophagus (striated muscle) was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI showed a lesion of the dorsal medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings are compatible with a specific lesion of the connections from a programming CPG in the solitary tract nucleus to nucleus ambiguus neurons, which supply the distal pharynx, upper esophageal sphincter, and proximal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is functional preservation of the CPG control center in the solitary tract nucleus and of the vagal dorsal motor nucleus neurons innervating the smooth muscle esophagus </plain></SENT>
