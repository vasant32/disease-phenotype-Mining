<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it's clinical significance has not been fully evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we made clinical and angiographic studies in patients with syndrome to elucidate the pathogenesis of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> presenting with this syndrome were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 51 years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were examined within 6 months of their first attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was made if subjective feeling of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the upper and lower extremities was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>increased deep tendon reflexes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was observed in 38% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed in 26 patients and divided into two groups; group A with ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (n = 9) and group B without ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 56% of patients in group A, angiography showed non-visualization of ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Non-visualization of these two arteries never occurred in the patients of group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, non-visualization of VA alone was observed in 35% of the patients in group B, but it was none in the patients of group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences in concerning the frequency of non-visualization of PICA alone or non-occlusion at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the region below the pyramidal decussation due to the occlusion of both VA and PICA, regardless of thrombotic or embolic episode, was considered to be responsible for ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
