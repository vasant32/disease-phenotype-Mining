<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report one instance where the thalamic effects of sensory deafferentation could be dissociated from those of neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 50-year-old patient underwent a left medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> leading to right-sided thermal and pain hypaesthesia up to the third right trigeminal division, as well as in the left face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the following months the patient developed neuropathic pain limited to the left side of the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the territory with sensory loss was much wider in the right (non painful) than in the left (painful) side of the body, PET-scan demonstrated significant reduction of blood flow in the right thalamus (contralateral to the small painful area) relative to its homologous region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of right motor cortex stimulation the patient reported 60% relief of his left facial pain, and a new PET-scan showed correction of the thalamic asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that thalamic PET-scan <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> contralateral to neuropathic pain does not merely reflect deafferentation, but appears related to the pain pathophysiology, and may be normalized in parallel with pain relief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms linking thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> and pain are discussed in relation with findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> patients, possible compensation phenomena and bursting thalamic discharges described in animals and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restoration of thalamic activity in neuropathic pain might represent one important condition to obtain successful relief by <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> procedures, including cortical neurostimulation </plain></SENT>
