<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 patients, who were diagnosed with localized brainstem lesions using MRI, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> in five patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0006051'>brainstem hemorrhage</z:mp> in three patients, pontomedullary infarction in one patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, 42 ears of 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult volunteers were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a patient with upper brainstem lesions mainly affecting the midbrain, the auditory brainstem response (ABR) was abnormal but the vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four patients with middle brainstem lesions which mainly affected the pons, both ABR and VEMP were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five patients with lower brainstem lesions which mainly affected the medulla, the ABR was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but the VEMP was abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those patients with middle-to-lower brainstem lesions, a disappearance of VEMP reactions, delay of the positive-negative (PN) wave, increase in PN interpeak latency and decrease in PN amplitude on the affected side were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the VEMP test comprises a useful new diagnostic method for identifying lower brainstem lesions </plain></SENT>
