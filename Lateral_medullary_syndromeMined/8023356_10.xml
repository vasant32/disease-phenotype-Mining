<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although lateral medullary infarction is a relatively common type of cerebrovascular disease, detailed correlation between clinical findings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has not yet been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 33 consecutive patients with lateral medullary infarction who showed appropriate MRI lesions and correlated their clinical findings with the MRI results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>Gait ataxia</z:hpo> (88%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>/dizziness (91%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (73%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (61%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo> (55%), Horner sign (73%), and facial (85%) and hemibody (94%) sensory changes were frequent clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI results showed that the lesions located in the rostral part of the medulla were usually diagonal band-shaped and were associated with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo>, and the presence of facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, whereas the caudal lesions, situated usually in the lateral surface of the medulla, appeared to correlate with more marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and Horner sign were common regardless of the lesion location, and lesions extending ventromedially correlated with facial sensory change on the contralateral side of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of MRI findings in rostrocaudal and dorsoventral aspects allows us, although not unequivocally, to make anatomicoclinical correlations in the evaluation of patients with lateral medullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
