<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic occlusion of the vertebral artery (VA) is one of the treatments for unclippable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and other lesions, although controversy still surrounds the appropriate site for occlusion to attain selective <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the lesion while avoiding ischaemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lower two-thirds of the lateral medulla are supplied by perforating branches of both the VA and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in patients without a PICA or in whom the origin of the PICA is low (at or below the foramen magnum), the VA is usually the only source of perforating vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied the results of VA occlusion on such anatomically high-risk patients, and propose a safer procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five high-risk patients underwent therapeutic occlusion of the VA for dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> developed due to propagation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> after the procedure in two patients in whom angiography did not demonstrate the anterior spinal artery (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) within the stump of the VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic signs did not develop in the other three patients, in whom the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was visible, and retrograde flow was observed proximal to the origin of the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> may play a role in preventing propagation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the VA distal to the site of occlusion and supply blood to its perforating arteries in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiographic assessment of the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> may be useful for predicting the likelihood of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> developing with therapeutic occlusion of the VA in patients without a PICA or with one whose origin is low </plain></SENT>
