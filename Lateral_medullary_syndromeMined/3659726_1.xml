<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the site and extension of the arterial lesions 3 clinico-pathologico-angiographic situations can be encountered: segmental occlusion (proximal: V1 or distal: V3, V4), multisegmental (mainly V1-V2, sometimes V1-V2-V3) or extensive (V1 or V4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequent infarctions are localized in ipsilateral cerebellar lobes and ipsilateral lateral part of the medulla oblongata; supra-medullary involvement is rare and indicates a propagation of the vertebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> into the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar, vestibular or cerebello-vestibular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> are the more frequent clinical disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are often preceded by occipito-cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to a common belief, the vital risk in vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is not negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 160 cases, 100 of which are personal, mortality was 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact benign segmental and proximal occlusion adequately compensated, specially when isolated, must be opposed to segmental distal occlusion and extensive occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography and DÃ¶ppler examinations localize arterial lesions and subsequent hemodynamic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment is often symptomatic only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgery of the proximal vertebral artery may in some cases be the only hope of preventing occlusion </plain></SENT>
