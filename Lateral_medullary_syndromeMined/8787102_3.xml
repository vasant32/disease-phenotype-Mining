<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>100 of overall cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were consecutively included in a prospective study using MRI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty three patients were investigated using transfemoral or magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides classical symptomatology, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual disorders</z:e> were usually noted: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> (n = 18), transient visual tilt of the surrounding (n = 4), skew deviation (= 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>esotropia</z:hpo> (n = 2) or conjugate gaze deviation (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The middle part of the medulla was affected in 35 cases </plain></SENT>
