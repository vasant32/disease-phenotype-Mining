<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e>, it is thought to result from altered signals in the olivo-cerebellar pathway to the oculomotor cerebellar network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study we aimed to determine whether saccadic lateropulsion results from a cerebellar impairment of motor related signals or visuo-spatial related signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the trajectory, the accuracy, the direction and the amplitude of a variety of vertical and oblique saccades produced by five patients and nine control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some results are consistent with previous data suggesting altered motor related signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the horizontal error of contralesional saccades in patients increased with the desired horizontal saccade size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the initial directional error measured during the saccadic acceleration phase was smaller than the global directional error, suggesting that the eye trajectory curved progressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, some other results suggest that the processes that specify the horizontal spatial goal of the saccades might be impaired in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the horizontal error of ipsilesional saccades in patients did not change significantly with the desired horizontal saccade size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, when comparing saccades with similar intended direction, it was found that the directional error was inversely related to the vertical saccade amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus we conclude that the cerebellum might be involved both in controlling the motor execution of saccades and in determining the visuo-spatial information about their goal </plain></SENT>
