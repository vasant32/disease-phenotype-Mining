<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES:   This study aimed to determine the laryngeal elevation muscle motor points, evaluate the movement of hyoid bone and larynx during stimulation of the motor points, and examine the potential for treating severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> by functional electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   The motor points of the laryngeal elevation muscles were anatomically determined from four cadavers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those motor points in two healthy subjects and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> patient were electrically stimulated by surface or implanted electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   The movements elicited by electrical stimulation of the motor points were greater in implanted than in surface electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevation of the hyoid bone and the larynx in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> patient were achieved with the implanted electrodes, but the upper esophageal sphincter opening was not obtained unless an additional cricopharyngeus muscle block was provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   The hyoid bone and larynx were elevated by electrically stimulating the motor points of the laryngeal elevation muscles </plain></SENT>
