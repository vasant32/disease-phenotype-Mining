<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 25-year-old man developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> (WS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At that time his carotid angiography was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When he was 28 years old, he suffered from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery embolism in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the age of 30 years, he had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abducens nerve palsy</z:e> in his right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid angiography showed a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the cavernous sinus portion in the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At his age of 38, the right oculomotor, trochlear and trigeminal nerves were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A vertebral angiography revealed a bead-like formation, and a diagnosis of fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (FMD) was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An intensive angiographic examination revealed many stenotic or dilated lesions in the carotid, vertebral, coronary, renal, and hepatic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A sural nerve biopsy specimen revealed that the sural vein was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Japan only one case of FMD presenting with WS is known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FMD should be under consideration as an underlying disease, when WS occurred in younger patients with few risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this patient an angiography revealed no abnormality in the cavernous sinus portion of the internal carotid artery, when he suffered from WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, eight years later he was proved to have a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the cavernous sinus portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we support the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> may originate from angiographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial wall in FMD </plain></SENT>
