<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one further patient with diffuse brain stem disease, we have been able to show bilateral loss of horizontal OKAN in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, with recovery during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings support the conclusion that the velocity storage mechanism or connections to it, are permanently disabled by unilateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and may be temporarily disabled by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retention of caloric responses in the absence of OKAN would appear to be of assistance in the differential diagnosis between peripheral and central vestibular pathway lesions </plain></SENT>
