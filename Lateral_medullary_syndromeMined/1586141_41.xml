<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients exhibited significant tilts of the internal representation of the gravity vector, as indicated by deviation of subjective visual vertical ipsiversive to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients (82%) had ipsiversive cyclorotation of one or both eyes, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271367" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">excyclotropia</z:e> of the eye ipsilateral to the brainstem lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 36 patients (33%), those with the most severe body lateropulsion, had a complete ocular tilt reaction consisting of <z:mp ids='MP_0005191'>head tilt</z:mp>, skew deviation, and cyclorotation in the roll plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that deviation of subjective visual vertical, lateropulsion of the body, and cyclorotation of the eyes are the perceptual, the ocular motor, and the postural consequences of a common lesion of central vestibular pathways that subserve the vestibuloocular reflex in the roll plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lateropulsion in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> is interpreted as a postural consequence of an abnormal tilt of the internal representation of orientation in space </plain></SENT>
