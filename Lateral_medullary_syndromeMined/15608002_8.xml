<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their importance may be underestimated and they can cause distress, exhaustion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hiccups in lateral medullary infarction remain poorly understood OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between the lesional loci of lateral medullary infarction and hiccups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 51 patients with lateral medullary infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging within three days of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 51 patients developed hiccup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with hiccups had middle level lateral medullary lesions, including two with lower level lesions and four with upper level lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the middle level lateral medullary lesions, dorsolateral lesions were most often involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with lateral medullary infarction presenting with hiccups also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observations suggest that middle level and dorsolateral lesion locations in lateral medullary infarction frequently induce hiccups </plain></SENT>
