<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The vertebrobasilar arterial system was assessed in 14 patients using transcranial and extracranial pulsed-wave Doppler and duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dissections were verified by angiography (in 1 patient), magnetic resonance imaging (in 5), or both (in 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dissected segments were atlantoaxial (V-3) in 6, V-3 and intertransverse (V-2) in 3, V-3 and intracranial (V-4) in 3, and V-2 in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracranial and transcranial Doppler examination of the atlas loop, involved in 12 patients, showed absent flow signal in 5, low bidirectional flow signal in 1, and poststenotic low blood flow velocities in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of these patients had high-grade stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stenotic segment with increased flow signal could be identified directly in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duplex examination of the intertransverse segment confirmed absent flow in 4 patients, making technically insufficient examination unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 2 patients with directly detected stenosis, duplex examination showed low flow velocities before the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined use of extracranial and transcranial Doppler and duplex sonography increases the diagnostic yield to detect vertebral artery pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If any abnormal sonographic finding was considered, the yield was 86%; relying only on definitively abnormal findings (absent flow signal, severely reduced vertebral artery blood flow velocities, no diastolic flow, bidirectional flow, and a stenosis signal), the yield was 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In most cases, there is no pathognomonic ultrasound finding for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, if a patient presents with suggestive symptoms, ultrasound may corroborate the clinical suspicion and aid in the decision regarding early <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A definite diagnosis can be made noninvasively when magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Angiography yields additional information such as nature of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, site and extent of dissection, intracranial extension, and presence of pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
