<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>Diplopia</z:hpo> was found in 10 of 31 patients (32%), with 5 patients reporting vertical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> alone and 5 reporting vertical and horizontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>Diplopia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> is considered to be caused by a lesion involving the otolith-ocular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vertical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> is simply explained by ocular skew deviation due to a lesion involving the vestibular nucleus; in which the affected eye becomes deviated inferiorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this situation, rotation of the eye due to ocular tilt reaction also occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant horizontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> may require involvement of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which produces skew deviation in mirror image; the unaffected eye becomes deviated inferiorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When downward deviation of the eye affected by dysfunction of the vestibular nucleus and that due to MLF dysfunction affecting the other eye are comparable, only horizontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> becomes apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MLF syndrome may be accompanied by paralytic pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi>) or non-paralytic pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> (NPPE), both of which may also participate in the appearance of horizontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
