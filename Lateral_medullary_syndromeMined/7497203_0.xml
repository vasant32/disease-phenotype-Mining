<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a 10 year-old girl with a WS caused by an embolism in the right lateral portion of the medulla secondary to an electrofulguration, but with an unusual progressive outcome, developing clinical signs of medial medullar injury, leading even into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> 30 days after admittance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She only became stable after surgical lesion decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of vascular malformation, finding only a great <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathology only showed changes compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case makes again clear the superiority of MRI upon CT-scan to diagnose a WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We think that the unusual progression of the lesion was due to great medullar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> found on surgery, involving the brain regional flow </plain></SENT>
