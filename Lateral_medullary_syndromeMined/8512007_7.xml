<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We here present 4 cases with dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) of the intracranial vertebral artery, who were followed up by repeat cerebral angiography and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients consisted of 2 males and 2 females, and the mean age was 43 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> (PN) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of the cases developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), while the other one suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cerebral angiography, "pearl and string" signs were revealed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, while a "double lumen" indicating a true diagnostic sign of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> was demonstrated in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiography showed that a <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bleb</z:mp> formation with a bulging of the aneurysmal sac was seen in 2 cases, and an irregularity of the wall in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand in one case, the ectatic part shrank, while the stenotic part was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a hyperintensity mass on T 1-weighted image (T 1-WI) adjacent to flow void suggesting either an intramural haematoma or a linear shape hyperintensity on T 1-WI were demonstrated in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the follow up MRI done in 2 cases, a serial change in the intensity from iso-intensity to hyperintensity on T 1-WI was observed in one case suggesting intramural haemorrhage, while an enlargement of the ectasic flow void was seen in the other case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of 4 cases were operated on by trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One, who had systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> due to PN, and repeat angiography showed a regression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, was conservatively treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
