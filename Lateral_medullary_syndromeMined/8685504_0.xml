<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In children and adolescents few data are available on its safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 28 patients (mean age 12.8) with symptomatic tachyarrhythmias underwent catheter ablation; 21 children had atrioventricular accessory pathways (11 right connections, 9 lef connections and one midseptal pathway), 3 had intranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and 2 had atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only four patients had associated structural anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Success rate was 71.4% (20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The success per cents in each group were: in intranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> 100%; we failed in the two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo>; in accessory pathways 76.1% and 50% in atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in a mean chase period of 24 months (12-46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major complications were only observed in one patient who developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency catheter ablation appears to be a safe and effective method to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in children and adolescents, which in most cases can supersede surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alow incidence of complications is reported, although long term damage on endocardial structures remains yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
