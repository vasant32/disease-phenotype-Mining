<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These "otolith" symptoms are less well known than vestibular symptoms issuing from the canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> who had one or more clinical signs suggestive of otolith pathway involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination looked for: Eleven patients presented ipsilesional skew deviation; ipsilesional tilt of subjective visual vertical was found in 8 patients; a room tilt illusion was described in 4 patients in either the frontal or the sagittal plane: 9 patients presented axial lateropulsion toward the lesioned side; 8 patients presented ipsilesional ocular lateropulsion, 6 of them in association with axial lateropulsion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, 3 patients presented positional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> evoked by <z:mp ids='MP_0005191'>head tilt</z:mp> in the roll or the pitch plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathophysiology of these symptoms and evidence for an otolith pathway involvement are discussed </plain></SENT>
