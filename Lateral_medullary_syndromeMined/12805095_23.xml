<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although there have been attempts to make clinical-MRI correlation in patients with lateral medullary infarction (LMI), studies with a large number of patients are unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, clinical features, MRI findings and angiogram results of 130 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, consecutive patients with pure LMI were studied and correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI-identified lesions were classified rostro-caudally as rostral, middle and caudal, and horizontally as typical, ventral, large, lateral and dorsal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of horizontal subtypes was significantly different (P &lt;0.001) among three rostro-caudal lesions in that rostral lesions tend to be ventral types and caudal lesions are lateral types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with rostrally located lesions had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.01, each) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) significantly more often, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05, each) less often than those with caudal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) and bilateral trigeminal sensory pattern (P &lt; 0.05) were significantly different among horizontal subtypes in that these symptoms were frequent in patients with "large type" as compared with those with lateral type lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiograms performed in 123 patients showed vertebral artery (VA) disease in 67% and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) disease in 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presumed pathogenetic mechanisms included large vessel infarction in 50%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> in 15%, small vessel infarction in 13% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dissection occurred more often in patients with caudal (versus rostral) lesions (P &lt; 0.01), whereas dorsal type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (versus other types) were related more often to cardiogenic embolism and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiogram findings (P &lt; 0.05, each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with isolated PICA disease (versus those with VA disease) more often had cardiogenic embolism (P &lt; 0.05) and less often had dissection (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that rostro-caudal and horizontal classification of MRI helps us to understand the clinical and, partly, the aetiopathogenetic aspect of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> LMI syndrome </plain></SENT>
