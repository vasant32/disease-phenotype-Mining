<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with infarction of the dorsolateral medulla oblongata affecting central sympathetic pathways (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>) and 21 healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the medial cerebral artery was investigated using transcranial Doppler ultrasound during decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure induced by leg-cuff test and tilt table </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Upon leg-cuff test, changes of cerebral blood flow and mean arterial blood pressure as well as autoregulatory index did not differ between patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in changes of CBFV, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate between patients or controls during the tilt table test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system does not have an influence on cerebral autoregulation after decrease in perfusion pressure under normotonous conditions </plain></SENT>
