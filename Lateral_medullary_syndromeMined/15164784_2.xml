<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted imaging in patients with Wallenberg's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with Wallenberg's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> were examined with conventional and echoplanar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in a 1.5 T magnetic resonance unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations were obtained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage of clinical syndrome, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was considered to be positive for infarction when an increase in signal was seen on b = 1000 s/mm2 images in the posterolateral medullary localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DWIs were positive in 12 patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stages of this clinical syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A false-negative result was obtained in only one patient examined within the first day, 10 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the visual evaluation of the DWI, the contrast between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and infarcted brainstem area was better in the high b-value images than in the apparent diffusion coefficient map images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DWI is a valuable technique for examining patients presenting with the signs and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> and high b-value images can provide complementary data to T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, because most of our case group were in either the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage, true sensitivity of the method in the hyperacute stage of the syndrome remains unclear </plain></SENT>
