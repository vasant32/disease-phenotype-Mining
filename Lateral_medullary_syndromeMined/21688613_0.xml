<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs rarely, but can lead to fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on our own case report, the aim of this article is to review its clinical symptoms, and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a patient who had symptoms of vascular lesion of the dorsolateral segment of the medulla, which was verified by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 12 of his hospital stay, in the early morning, rapid development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> was observed, which was an expression of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> with dominant <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the beginning, urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation were necessary, while in the later course of the disease breathing was assisted by noninvasive methods of Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Throughout the night, polygraph recording confirmed the diagnosis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010536'>central sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The course of the disease was favorable, with a very slow but constant improvement of respiratory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to literature data, the disease course is not always favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are published cases where it was concluded that ventilatory support was no longer needed but after a long period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred suddenly during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007110'>central hypoventilation</z:hpo> consists of ventilatory support, but there were also attempts of medicamentous treatment with the common aim of raising alertness and reactibility of the automatic breathing center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is important to emphasize that patients with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010536'>central sleep apnea</z:hpo> should not be supplied with oxygen without arterial blood gas monitoring because of the possibility of delaying the right diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of oxygen in patients who already have <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> could further intensify hyporeactivity of the breathing center and lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
