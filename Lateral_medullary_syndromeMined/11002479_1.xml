<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surface electromyograms(EMG) were recorded from both sides of the sternocleidomastoid muscles, with a reference over the jugular notch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EMG were averaged from 500 responses to 135 dB SPL, 3 c/s(0.1 ms) through one side of a headphone, with 115 dB masking noise in the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average potentials were collected at 20 ms before the clicks to 80 ms afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> healthy subjects showed typical biphasic complex responses(P 13-N 23-N 34-P 44) bilaterally by unilateral stimulation, predominantly on the ipsilateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average latencies were as follows: P 13(13.3 ms +/- 2.1 SD); N 23(22.2 ms +/- 2.7 SD); N 34(32.2 ms +/- 3.1 SD); and P 44(43.6 ms +/- 3.1 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average P 13-N 23 peak amplitude was 20.4 +/- 3.3 microV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, in which pure tone audiograms showed thresholds higher than 80 dB, latencies of VEMP were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits of the deaf side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, VEMP could not be evoked in the affected side in 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral vestibular disorders</z:e> or patients with 7 cerebello-pontine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0474740" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">angle tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients with endolymphatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo>, latencies of VEMP were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The P 13-N 23 peak amplitude, however, was remarkably enlarged after 500 ml of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> drip infusion(<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, the latency of P 13 was prolonged on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is concluded that the present study would provide additional information about the vestibular function, especially the otolith function, and clinical usefulness of detecting both central and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral vestibular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
