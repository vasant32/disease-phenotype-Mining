<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> are seen in monkeys after local unilateral injection of GABAergic drugs in the caudal fastigial nucleus of monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These include an ipsilateral saccadic hypermetria and a contralateral saccadic hypometria as well as cogwheel smooth pursuit eye movements toward the contralateral side and an ipsiversive lateropulsion of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was previously suggested that the lateral medullary infarction causes a lesion of climbing fibers to the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This lack of climbing fiber input increases the activity of ipsilateral Purkinje cells, which consequently provide too much inhibition of the deep cerebellar nuclei </plain></SENT>
