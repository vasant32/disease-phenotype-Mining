<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have described a patient in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> followed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> during sleep was due to <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the palatal and pharyngeal muscles resulting from the neurologic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient initially had reduced respiratory center motor output (mouth occlusion pressure) which increased significantly after tracheostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that obstructive as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> may follow neurologic lesions </plain></SENT>
