<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have carried out a prospective study of the sympathetic skin response (SSR) in 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> (LMS), with the aim of identifying the most common pattern of SSR abnormalities and its possible correlation with clinical and radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of the SSR recorded in the ipsilateral hand to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was abnormally reduced in the patients as a group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, using different stimulation and recording sites, and considering only the presence or absence of the response, we identified 5 different patterns of SSR abnormalities: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> responses; 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilaterally absent responses to stimulation of the ipsilateral supraorbital nerve but not to other stimulation sites; 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absent responses in the side ipsilateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> responses in the contralateral side; 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A combination of patterns 2 and 3; and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absent responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with ipsilateral facial sensory loss had absent SSR to ipsilateral supraorbital nerve stimulation, while there was only a positive correlation between abnormal contralateral facial sensation and preservation of the SSR (Fisher's exact test P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the pattern of SSR abnormalities and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> topography, assessed with the MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the damage to the SSR circuits of patients with LMS is not uniform, and follows an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> distribution independent from the MRI findings, and poorly related to the clinical sensory manifestations </plain></SENT>
