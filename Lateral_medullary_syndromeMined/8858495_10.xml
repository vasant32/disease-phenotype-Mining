<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dissociated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain-stem disorders</z:e> suggests a lateral lesion involving the spinothalamic tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evoked potential studies of the somatosensory system with standard electrical stimulation (SEP) generally fail to establish objective correlates of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e>, because electrical stimuli predominantly activate large myelinated fibers that project into the medial lemniscal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, laser-evoked potentials (LEPs), in response to brief radiant heat pulses, stimulate nociceptive afferents of the superficial skin and allow evaluation of thin fiber and spinothalamic tract function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe the recovery of deficits in pain sensitivity in five patients with isolated lateral brain-stem lesions that could be successfully monitored by LEP recordings in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and after intervals ranging from 7 months to 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon first examination, LEPs were abnormal on the affected body side in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e>, irrespective of whether the etiology was vascular or inflammatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of recovery of pain sensitivity upon reexamination was reflected by the extent of normalization of the LEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A control patient with vascular pontine lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LEPs on both sides, suggesting preserved spinothalamic conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The peak-to-peak amplitude of the main LEP component (N250-P400) correlated significantly with clinical pain sensitivity scored by standardized sensory testing (r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, early and late SEPs, after standard electrical median or tibial nerve stimulation, were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, consistent with their intact mechanosensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, LEP studies allow the status of nociceptive function to be objectively and reliably documented on repeated examinations and therefore provide a useful supplement to multimodal sensory assessment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain-stem disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
