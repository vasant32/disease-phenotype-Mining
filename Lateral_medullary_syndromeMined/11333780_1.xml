<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to review the clinical profile and the distribution of these complications in a retrospective series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: A retrospective analysis of the last 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster</z:e> with neurologic complications to our center from 1992 to 1999 by the Departments of Internal Medicine and Neurology was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the complications other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032768" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postherpetic neuralgia</z:e> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aside from the 88 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032768" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postherpetic neuralgia</z:e>, the 12 remaining patients presented other complications: seven different <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo>, including three with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, one patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ophthalmic herpes zoster</z:e> with cerebral vasculopathy as ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (75%) were males, four (25%) were under the age of 20 years and seven older than 60 years and only three were immunodepressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CSF was abnormal in six out of the eight patients in whom it was studied with lymphocytic pleocytosis being shown on analysis without qualitative or quantitative alteration in intrathecal synthesis of IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the immunosuppressed patients the serology in the CSF of the varicela <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zoster</z:e> virus was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients demonstrated regressive evolution following treatment with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic complications other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032768" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postherpetic neuralgia</z:e> occurred in 12% of the patients of this series, there was male predominance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo> were the most frequent complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serology of the varicela <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zoster</z:e> virus in immunosuppressed patients may be negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this series the prognosis was mainly satisfactory </plain></SENT>
