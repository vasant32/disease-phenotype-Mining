<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Review of two inpatient cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The rehabilitation unit of a tertiary general hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> who had solitary cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Assessment with standard neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scores were compared with patients' premorbid levels and standardized test norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A classical conditioning eyeblink paradigm was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychological measures of intellectual and executive functions, learning and memory, visual-spatial abilities, language functioning, fine motor speed, and dexterity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Test findings suggested lesion-associated deficits in higher aspects of cognition (visuospatial reasoning, verbal and visual memory, and intellectual and executive functions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These functions are not usually associated with the fundamentally motoric role of the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) Lesions in the cerebellum can be associated with impairments in higher cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(2) Such effects may be severe enough for a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> under current diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(3) These rehabilitation patients may benefit from comprehensive cognitive examination to determine if cognitive effects will detract from their participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(4) Further research is needed to localize which cerebellar areas affect which cognitive abilities </plain></SENT>
