<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Macro- and micro-somatognosia refer to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorders</z:e> of the cerebral representation of the body whereby patients perceive body parts as disproportionately large or small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the experimental study of a patient who, following a left lateral medullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, including vestibular deficits) complained of a persistent somatosensory illusory sensation of swelling, confined to the left side of his face (i.e., left macrosomatognosia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hemifacial somatosensory distortion was associated with a left facial anesthesia, and a neuropathic pain affecting the three branches of the left trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we first document quantitatively the patient's somatosensory illusion by using a somatosensory-to-visual matching task in which the patient modified the picture of his own face to fit his left-sided somatosensory misperception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's performance revealed that macrosomatognosia was confined to the second branch of the left trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perception of the size of visual objects was comparatively preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second, we investigated the effects of two peripheral stimulations, which may affect the spatial component of somatosensory deficits (caloric vestibular stimulation, CVS; transcutaneous electrical <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> stimulation, TENS) and pain (TENS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left CVS abolished the facial somatosensory illusion, for about 30min, but had no effect on the left facial pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, left TENS substantially reduced the neuropathic pain during stimulation, but had no effect on macrosomatognosia, indicating a double dissociation between the two disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results reveal that facial macrosomatognosia may be regarded as a high-order deficit of somatosensory perception of the shape and volume of the face, which fits the definition of 'hyperschematia' (i.e., when the body takes up too much room) originally proposed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1390409" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bonnier</z:e> (1905) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data also indicate that CVS may favor the restoration of the conscious representation of the shape and size of the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, these findings lend support to the view that afferent inputs from the vestibular system can affect in a specific fashion the activity of cerebral structures involved in the building up and updating of the topological description of body parts </plain></SENT>
