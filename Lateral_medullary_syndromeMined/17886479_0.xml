<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> following head and neck injury, whom we treated from 1993 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one patient suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> following direct neck injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of injury three patients had prodromal symptoms and the others had no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients were diagnosed with artery-to-artery embolism based on the dissection of the internal carotid artery in the neck, two patients, from the dissection of the vertebral artery in the neck, and one patient was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall patient outcomes at discharge as measured by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale were as follows: moderately disabled in one, severely disabled in three, vegetative survival in one, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient had been administered a screening test for neck vessel injury, indicating the difficulty in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prodromal symptoms, due to not only direct but also indirect neck injuries indicate the possibility of neck vessels injury, and hence, we should develop a method that enables the early detection of lesions caused by neck vessel injury </plain></SENT>
