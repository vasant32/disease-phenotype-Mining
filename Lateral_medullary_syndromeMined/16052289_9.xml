<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> located on the distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) are rare, and their underlying clinical features and surgical management are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our series of 16 patients with 18 distal PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with distal PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated between March 1996 and August 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that involved the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were analysed in the light of their clinical profiles, radiological studies, intraoperative findings and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent non-enhanced and contrast enhanced CT scans followed by 4-vessel cerebral angiography on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hemorrhagic patterns on initial CT scans were assessed using the Fisher Grading Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcomes were documented using the Glasgow Outcome Scale at time of discharge and at three or twelve months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The series included 6 men and 10 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Massive intraventricular haemorrhage was found in 13 patients with proven CT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, one patient revealed SAH without intraventricular components, one presented with only intraventricular blood in the occipital horns and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were found incidentally without presence of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were saccular and four were fusiform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine cases were associated with another cerebrovascular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A lateral transcondylar or a median suboccipital approach was used to secure the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 15 patients, either by direct clipping (14 lesions) or vessel sacrifice (3 lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by an endovascular approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At long-term follow up, an excellent or good outcome was achieved in 75% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to pre-existing cardiopulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most of our cases of ruptured distal PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presented with haematocephalus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These were frequently associated with another vascular abnormality and 22% were fusiform or multilobulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These specific features require special management strategies entailing an appropriate surgical approach to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, clipping method, haematoma removal, ventricular drainage and when suitable choice of endovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
