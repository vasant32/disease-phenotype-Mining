<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He died, of extracerebral causes, shortly after hospitalization and an autopsy study was done on the brainstem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Right ear stimulation disclosed BAEP abnormalities, but gave no indication of the level of the ischemic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination showed a typical right dorsolateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed study of the acoustic pathways demonstrated their anatomical integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm the uncertainty that still exists as to the exact location and type of generators of BAEP components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They suggest, moreover, that BAEPs can give objective evidence of functional impairment of brainstem acoustic structures even in the absence of persistent anatomical damage </plain></SENT>
