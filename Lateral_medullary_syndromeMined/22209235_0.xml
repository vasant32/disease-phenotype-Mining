<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our series of 29 ruptured PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with surgical treatment along with the description of the surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the PICA to the lower cranial nerves in cadaveric specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with ruptured PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who were surgically treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University during the period from January 1995 to December 2008 were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data relating to clinical, radiological, and intraoperative findings were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty formalin-fixed cerebellar hemispheres provided the material for the study of describing the detailed surgical anatomic relationship of the PICA to the lower cranial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our series, ruptured PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> reached an incidence of 2.35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (44.8%) located in the proximal segment, and 16 (55.2%) located in the distal segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 89.7% were saccular, 6.9% fusiform, and 3.4% dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Usually, the surgical outcome was influenced by Poor admission grade, the presence of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and associated distal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cadaveric specimen, 17.5% of PICAs passed between the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, 7.5% between the vagus and accessory nerves, and 62.5% through the rootlets of the accessory nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report summarizes the presentation and outcome of a large series of 29 patients with ruptured PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and we conclude that ruptured PICA with surgical treatment usually gets well recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study does, however, also demonstrate that the anatomic relationship of the PICA and lower cranial nerves is somehow variable and irregular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the findings in cadaveric dissection is essential in treating lesions of this region </plain></SENT>
