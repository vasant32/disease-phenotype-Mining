<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients with Wallenberg's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e>, one patient with a midbrain lesion involving the right side of the tegmentum, and 2 patients with a thalamic lesion, corneal reflexes were investigated by a new electromyographic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrophysical results were compared with the results obtained by clinical observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the lateral medullary lesions the electrophysiologically obtained reflex responses showed four types of abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type A consisted of a bilateral delay and type B a bilateral absence of the corneal reflex response to stimulation on the affected side in combination with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reflex response on both sides when the cornea on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side was stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type C, which was present in one case, and type D which was seen in 3 cases, consisted of a bilateral absence of the corneal reflex upon stimulation on the affected side; stimulation on the unaffected side produced a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reflex response on the intact side in combination with, respectively, a delay or absence of the corneal reflex response on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the clinical observations with the electrophysiological findings revealed minor discrepancies in type A and B abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the electrophysiological type C and D abnormalities were not detected by clinical observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that electrophysiological recording of the corneal reflex may reveal clinically undetectable abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the electrophysiological findings it is concluded that the corneal reflex is conducted along medullary pathways running both ipsilaterally and contralaterally from the stimulated side before connecting, respectively, with the ipsilateral and contralateral facial nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the anatomical findings it is suggested that the ascending pathways from the spinal fifth nerve complex to the facial nuclei are located in the lateral reticular formation of the lower brain-stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> corneal reflex responses in the presence of thalamic and midbrain lesions involving nociceptive fibres in the trigeminothalamic tract do not support a previously postulated long-loop reflex arc passing through this tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The suprabulbar influence upon the corneal reflex is discussed </plain></SENT>
