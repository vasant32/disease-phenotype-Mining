<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, heterotopic painful stimuli induce simultaneous and parallel decreases in the sensation of pain and in the spinal nociceptive flexion (RIII) reflex evoked by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This inhibition of the RIII reflex is not seen in tetraplegic patients with clinically complete spinal cord transection, suggesting that supraspinal structures are involved in this type of inhibition, mediated through 'Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls' (DNIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of heterotopic nociceptive stimuli on the RIII reflex were examined in 3 patients with unilateral thalamic vascular lesions and in 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> (WS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the former, as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, nociceptive electrical conditioning stimuli applied to the <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> hand produced a profound inhibition of the RIII reflex followed by long-lasting after-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No inhibition was observed in the WS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same conditioning procedure applied to the nonanalgesic hand of the WS patients resulted in inhibition and after-effects similar to those observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fact that noxious but nonpainful stimuli triggered DNIC in the patients with thalamic lesions excludes the possibility that masking of pain by a second painful focus is mainly due to attentional processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is also concluded that lemniscal and spinothalamic pathways are not involved in the triggering of DNIC in man and it is suggested that the brainstem and probably the spinoreticular tract are key neuronal links in the loop subserving DNIC in man </plain></SENT>
