<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This led to substitution of the original and correct diagnosis by that of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221057" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic syndrome</z:e> for which a prefrontal leucotomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient died some years later from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and autopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the dorsolateral part of the medulla oblongata a cavity was found in which aberrant nerve fibres with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027858" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neuroma</z:e>-like formations could be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These fibres coursed along blood vessels, and penetrated from the surface of the medulla oblongata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the base of the clinico-pathological correlations, it is conjectured that destruction of the lateral reticular formation cannot be the sole cause of the severe pain </plain></SENT>
