<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two components, N2 and P2, were recorded by stimulation of the unaffected hand, whereas on the affected side they were absent or decreased in proportion to the severity of hypalgesia which was evaluated by both needle test and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> laser stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Latency of either component, if appeared, was longer in the affected hand stimulation than that in the unaffected one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, N20 of the conventional electrically-stimulated SEPs (electric SEPs) showed no difference between the two sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, unlike other electrophysiological methods, pain SEPs following <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> laser stimulation can quantitatively evaluate functional impairment of the spinothalamic tract in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
