<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of experiments in rodents and clinical data, the present study addresses the hypothesis of bilateral projection of facial nociceptive input onto the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) in healthy humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nociceptive processing in the brainstem was investigated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 18 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heat stimuli (39, 43, 46 degrees C) were applied by a Peltier type thermode to the left forehead (V1) and the left mental region (V3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of fMRI data were performed with SPM2 and BrainVoyager software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A region-of-interest approach analyzed local activation in the STN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heat evoked significant bilateral activation in the STN (P &lt; 0.01, T &gt; 2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral activation was more frequent during stimulation of the V1 than of the V3 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas activation by V1 stimulation was located in caudal STN, V3 stimulation induced activity in more rostral parts of the STN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional MRI data in humans suggest bilateral brainstem activation when heat is applied to the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Contralateral brainstem activity is more pronounced by stimulation of V1 as compared to V3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results indicate similar nociceptive processing in humans and rodents and may explain clinical findings </plain></SENT>
