<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e>), records of 93 patients (70 men, 21 women, and 2 patients not identified by gender; mean age at ictus, 58.1 years) with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> who underwent MRI and/or vertebral angiography were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study items included the following: (A) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>; (B) arterial intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> on T1-weighted images as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> finding; and (C) double lumen, intimal flap, pearl and string sign, and string sign as angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These abnormal findings suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> were scored as 1 or 2 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to his or her total score, each patient was classified as "definite dissection." "probable dissection," "suspected dissection," or "no dissection." Twenty-three of 93 patients were classified as "definite dissection," 23 as "probable dissection," 27 as "suspected dissection," and 20 as "no dissection." The frequency of definite or probable dissection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> was estimated at 50% or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> is a frequent cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
