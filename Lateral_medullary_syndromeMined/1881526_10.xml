<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case is reported of ruptured dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the intracranial vertebral artery (VA) operated on with VA trapping and bilateral posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) side-to-side anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 42-year-old male suddenly developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, 3 hours later, he was in a state of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> (Japan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale 3) and had neck stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, especially thick in the posterior fossa with right side dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right vertebral angiography disclosed a fusiform <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> with proximal narrowing of the right VA which originated just proximal to the VA-PICA junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lateral suboccipital craniectomy was undertaken with the patient in a left park bench position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Right VA was dilated and discolored black, and right PICA arose from the proximal portion of this aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since it was impossible to clip the VA distal to the PICA for the proximal clip-occlusion, the VA including the VA-PICA junction was trapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering the risk of developing infarction at the PICA territory, bilateral PICA was anastomosed at their posterior medullary segment in a side-to-side fashion because the occipital artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) had been cut at the skin incision and could not be used for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>-PICA anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was benign, but a mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CT revealed no abnormal low density area and left vertebral angiography demonstrated the patency of the bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the deficit subsided gradually and the patient was discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>He is presently working without neurological deficit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
