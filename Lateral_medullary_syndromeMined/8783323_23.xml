<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) lesions, during which non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> or hypoalgesic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and occasionally occurring in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012075'>personality disorders</z:hpo>, ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013146" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug abuse</z:e> and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0600074" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autotomy</z:e> may result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
