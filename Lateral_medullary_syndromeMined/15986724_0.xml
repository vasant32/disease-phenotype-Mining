<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ventricle) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (PFT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> (CH), and the outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> (WS) after functional swallowing therapy (FST) has so far not been studied in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>208 patients with neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (ND) who were consecutively admitted for functional swallowing therapy (FST) over a 3 year period to our hospital were examined clinically, by use of a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and/or fibreoptic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent etiology was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (48%), followed by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study we defined three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 1 comprised 8 patients with PFT or CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 2 consisted of 27 patients with WS, which was the leading cause among patients with non-hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since in WS a vagal nerve <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> due to affection of the Nucleus ambiguus occurs, 8 patients with Avellis' syndrome or unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the vagal nerve served as controls and were defined as group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the three groups, functional feeding status showed significant improvement after FST comprising methods of restitution, compensation and adaptation, each of which were applied in more than 80% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcome was, however, significantly worse in group 1 as compared to group 2 and in group 2 as compared to group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dysfunction of the upper esophageal sphincter and reflex triggering were significantly more severely disturbed in groups 1 and 2 as compared to group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Group 1 showed significantly more severe disturbances of the oral phase as compared to groups 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After FST, more than 50% (5/8) of group 1 and 30% (8/27) of WS patients (group 2) were dependent on tube feeding, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients of group 3 were full-oral feeders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This is the first study dealing with the outcome of dysphagic patients with PFT or CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Based on our results it can be assumed that in these patients pressure is exerted on both dorsomedial central pattern generators (DMCPGs) for swallowing in a posterior-anterior direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Due to the importance of the DMCPGs for swallowing, bilateral (and often MRI-invisible) lesions seem to be very harmful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For a better understanding of the pathomechanism responsible for ND in patients with PFT or CH, modern imaging methods such as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy should be used for studying metabolic changes in the dorsal medulla in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Since the outcome of patients with WS with regard to dependence of tube feeding was not associated with the site or size of the lesion, it may due to the individual asymmetry of the swallowing-dominant forebrain hemisphere - depend on the side of the medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
