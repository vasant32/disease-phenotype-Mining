<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Previous reports have suggested that endovascular parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results of long-term outcomes are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reviewed the clinical and imaging outcomes of patients with VAD treated by endovascular internal trapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 73 patients were treated for VAD by endovascular internal trapping between March 1998 and March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were regularly followed up by magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and clinical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five patients had ruptured VADs, and 28 had unruptured VADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up of at least 6 months data was obtained for 61 patients (83.6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 145 months (mean ± SD, 55.6 ± 8.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with ruptured VADs had recurrence (2.74 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>Cranial nerve paresis</z:hpo> (CNP) was observed in six patients (8.21 %), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> in two patients (2.74 %), and a perforating artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was diagnosed in seven patients (9.59 %); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CNP and five of the patients with partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> experienced only temporary symptoms; two of the patients with partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> had permanent neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite their symptoms, most patients were in good general condition, as shown by their clinical scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study have proven that endovascular internal trapping is a stable and durable treatment for closure of VADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recanalization is rather rare and occurred only in ruptured cases, both within 3 months after initial treatment without rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CNPs were observed in 8.21 %, perforating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in 9.59 %, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> in 2.74 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The former two are temporary, while the last can be a factor that affects the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients rated their quality of life as good, as corroborated by their posttreatment clinical score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Endovascular internal trapping for VAD is a therapy with a satisfactory long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
