<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The goal of this study was to implement an algorithm for and assess the multimodal (endovascular and microsurgical) treatment of patients with ruptured dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery (VA) during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 4-year period, the authors treated 19 ruptured dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the VA during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, within 3 days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors guiding management decisions were tolerance of the test occlusion and the site of the dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The algorithm takes into account these factors to select among treatment options, that is, trapping of the VA with Guglielmi Detachable Coils (GDCs); trapping of the VA and revascularization of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA); trapping of the VA and VA-posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis; and trapping of the VA, VA-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, and revascularization of the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> without PICA involvement, 14 were treated by trapping of the VA with GDCs and one by trapping of the VA and a VA-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with PICA involvement were treated by VA trapping and PICA revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no episode of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during the posttreatment follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> developed as a permanent complication in one patient, a good recovery was made by the other 18 patients by 6 months after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The factors that determine the appropriate treatment for ruptured dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the VA are tolerance of a test occlusion and the site of dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Favorable patient outcomes can be achieved when this algorithm is used </plain></SENT>
