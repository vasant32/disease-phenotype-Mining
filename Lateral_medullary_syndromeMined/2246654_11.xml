<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report 10 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> in the territory of the medial branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (mPICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Axial sections on MRI through the middle of the medulla and the cerebellum showed the infarction as a triangular area with a dorsal base and a ventral apex directed towards the fourth ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> also involved the lateral and dorsal medulla when the mPICA supplied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or part of these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three clinical patterns were observed: 1) pseudolabyrinthine signs with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> when the medulla was spared; marked axial lateropulsion was present in most cases; 2) complete or incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, when the medulla was involved; 3) silent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These syndromes are precisely those previously attributed to PICA occlusion without distinction of the branch involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No alteration of consciousness was recorded and spontaneous recovery was the rule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebellar infarction</z:e> in the distribution of the mPICA can be regarded as a benign condition with a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
