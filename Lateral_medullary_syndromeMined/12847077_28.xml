<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas laser-evoked scalp potentials (LEPs) are now reliably used to assess function of the Adelta-fibre nociceptive pathways in patients with peripheral or central lesions, the selective activation of C-fibre receptors and recording of the related brain potentials remain difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate trigeminal C-fibre function, we directed laser pulses to the facial skin and studied sensory perception and scalp evoked potentials related to Adelta- or C-fibre activation in healthy humans and patients--one having a bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>, two a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trigeminal neuropathy</z:e>, and two a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also measured afferent conduction velocity and, with source analysis, studied the brain generators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas laser pulses of low intensity and small irradiated area elicited pinprick sensations and standard Adelta-LEPs, laser pulses of very-low intensity and large irradiated area elicited warmth sensations and scalp potentials with a latency compatible with C-fibre conduction (negative wave 280 ms, positive wave 380 ms); the estimated conduction velocity was 1.2 m/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main waves of the scalp potentials originated from the anterior cingulate gyrus; they were preceded by activity in the opercular region and followed by activity in the insular region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>, who had absent trigeminal-facial reflexes, had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Adelta- and C-related scalp potentials; the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trigeminal neuropathy</z:e>, characterized by loss of myelinated and sparing of unmyelinated fibres, had absent Adelta- but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> C-related potentials; and the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> had absent Adelta- and C-related potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that laser pulses with appropriate characteristics evoke brain potentials related to the selective activation of trigeminal nociceptive Adelta or thermal C fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The trigeminal territory yields rewarding LEP findings owing to the high density of thermal receptors and, because the short conduction distance, minimizes the problem of signal dispersion along slow-conducting unmyelinated afferents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The opercular-insular region and the cingulate gyrus are involved in the processing of C-fibre trigeminal inputs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The method we describe may prove useful in patients with lesions affecting the trigeminal thermal pain pathways </plain></SENT>
