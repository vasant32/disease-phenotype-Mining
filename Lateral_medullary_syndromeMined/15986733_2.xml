<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our understanding of brainstem swallowing centers is mainly based on experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to solve this problem also in humans, a clinical-anatomical study on dysphagic patients with different lesion patterns was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 43 consecutively admitted dysphagic patients with unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the vagal nerve (PVN), Avellis' syndrome (AS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> (WS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021432" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">posterior fossa tumour</z:e> (PFT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> (CH) with regard to clinical and anatomical aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: There was a continuum with regard to functional outcome from neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (ND): Patients with PFT or CH had a significantly worse outcome than patients with WS; the outcome of WS patients was significantly worse than that of patients with PVN or AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In AS only the Nucleus ambiguus (NA) and its surrounding reticular formation (RF) were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with WS, the infarctions of the dorsolateral medulla were situated in the rostral third of the medulla and affected the NA and the Nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) with their surrounding RF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with PFT and CH, the NTS and its surrounding RF were affected on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overlap area of WS and PFT lesions is situated in the NTS and the surrounding RF, especially in its Nucleus parvocellularis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our results point to the fact, that in humans the dorsomedial central pattern generators (CPGs) for swallowing are situated in the rostral part of the dorsal medulla oblongata near the NTS/surrounding RF (especially Nucleus parvocellularis) and that the dorsomedial CPGs are superior to the ventrolateral CPGs (near the NA/surrounding RF) with regard to their swallowing-relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we hypothesize that due to the individual asymmetry of the swallowing-dominant forebrain hemisphere - the outcome from ND in WS depends on the side of the medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
