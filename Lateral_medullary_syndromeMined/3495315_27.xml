<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The fundamental pattern of coordinated eye-head roll motion is based upon utricular/saccular as well as vertical canal input, and mediated by the graviceptive pathways from the labyrinths via pontomedullary vestibular nuclei to the rostral midbrain tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tonic bilateral graviceptive input stabilizes the eyes and head in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> upright position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A unilateral lesion causes imbalance in vestibular tone in the roll plane which results in a tonic ipsiversive ocular tilt reaction (OTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OTR, the triad of ipsilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0005191'>head tilt</z:mp>, skew deviation and ocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath>, occurred as a tonic response (nonparoxysmal) persisting over months to years and was presumed to be due to upper brainstem lesions in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Precise localization was limited because of the nature of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reversible tonic OTR was seen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction of the dorsolateral medulla oblongata in 4 out of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may be explained by an ipsilateral lesion of the posterior canal pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient OTR seems not to be rare in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> and ocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> in these patients is dysconjugate with predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271367" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">excyclotropia</z:e> of the ipsilateral hypotropic eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A deviation of the subjective visual vertical in the direction of the spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005191'>head tilt</z:mp>--a previously undescribed feature of OTR--was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients and indicates a pathological shift of the internal representation of the gravitational vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to perception (subjective vertical) it is proposed that the manifest ipsiversive OTR represents a motor compensation of an apparent eye-<z:mp ids='MP_0005191'>head tilt</z:mp> contraversive to the lesioned side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite the resulting postural imbalance and the conflicting true vertical of the visual surround, the eyes, head and body are continuously adjusted to what the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system erroneously computes as being vertical </plain></SENT>
