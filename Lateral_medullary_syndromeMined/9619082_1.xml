<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We described early features of MRI diffusion weighted images (DWIs) in three patients with lateral medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 65-year-old woman who complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> was admitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, DWIs showed a high signal intensity in the right lateral medulla, though T2 weighted images (T2WIs) did not show any abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the next day, when the typical symptoms and signs of lateral medullary infarction appeared, the lesion was recognized on both DWIs and T2WIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 48-year-old man was admitted 9 hours after he had dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomitings</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> was made on the neurological examination, MRI DWIs demonstrated a high signal intensity in the right lateral medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lesion became apparent on T2WIs 82 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A 71-year-old man was admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, dizziness, and repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomitings</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> was made fifty eight hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a lesion with high signal intensity in the right lateral medulla was evident on DWIs, but it was faint on T2WIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We concluded that DWIs is useful in early diagnosis of lateral medullary infarction presenting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
