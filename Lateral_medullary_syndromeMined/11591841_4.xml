<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To characterize the incidence, topography, and radiologic and pathophysiologic findings of ipsilateral sensory symptoms in the limbs/body in patients with lateral medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between 1994 and 2001, the author identified 12 patients with lateral medullary infarction (6.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lateral medullary infarction patients) who presented with ipsilateral sensory symptoms in the limbs/body in addition to typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI, nerve conduction velocity, and electromyographic studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients without ipsilateral sensory symptoms were included as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiologic findings were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ipsilateral sensory symptoms were generally described as numbness or tightness, predominantly affecting the upper extremities, especially distal fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vibration and proprioceptive sensation were occasionally impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radiculopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with ipsilateral sensory symptoms significantly more often had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo>, hiccup, ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and caudally located lesions than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The caudal lesions producing ipsilateral sensory symptoms tended to extend dorsomedially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lateral medullary infarction associated with ipsilateral sensory symptoms in the limbs/body is an uncommon but distinct variant caused by caudal lesions extending dorsomedially that probably involve the ipsilateral dorsal column or decussating lemniscal fibers </plain></SENT>
