<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Classically, patients with unilateral lateral medullary infarction exhibit sensory abnormalities over the ipsilateral face and contralateral hemibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a variant, bilateral or contralateral facial sensory changes can be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, sensory changes in the ipsilateral extremities are extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We describe three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> in whom impaired deep sensation in the ipsilateral limbs was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI results showed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were located superficially in the lateral (case 1) and dorsal (cases 2 and 3) areas of the lower medulla, which probably involved the ascending or crossing dorsal column sensory tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, impaired ipsilateral deep sensation is encountered in patients with lateral medullary infarction syndrome </plain></SENT>
