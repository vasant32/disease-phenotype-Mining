<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 52-year-old woman was admitted to our department because of a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of left orbital pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emergency CT scan disclosed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination at the time of the current admission, showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, left soft palate palsy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo>, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo>, hypalgesia with thermohypesthesia on the right side of her face, however, hypalgesia with thermohypesthesia on the right side of her body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> was based on the above findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images disclosed the infarcted lesion at the left lateral medulla depicted as high-intensity on T2-weighted &amp; FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We carried out conservative treatment with antiplatelet &amp; hemodilution therapies and the blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left vertebral angiograms obtained 18 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, showed the segmental severe stenosis of the VA between the ramification of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and the union of the VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the venous phase, retention of contrast medium in the VA and the PICA was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The flow rate of the parent artery was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We strongly suspected that her initial symptom of left orbital pain was due to dissection of the VA itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional CT angiograms obtained 30 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, demonstrated the defect of the left VA between the ramification of the left PICA and the union of the VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Left vertebral angiograms obtained 36 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, showed the occlusion of the VA between the ramification of the PICA and the union of the VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The neurological findings gradually improved and the patient was discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow up left vertebral angiograms obtained 4 months &amp; 16 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, revealed almost no changes of left VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
