<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the course of this study, four patients with the Wallenberg [correction of Wallemberg] syndrome were examined and underwent further periodical checks after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were fed employing a naso-gastric tube and in one case an emergency tracheostomy was performed because <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic protocol following included the collection of a series of anamnestic data, an objective study of U.A.D.T. with fiberoptic endoscopy, swallowing simulation, dynamic radiologic examination (videofluoroscopy) and computerized static posturography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This routine was repeated upon every successive check </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the first observation a substantial uniformity of physiopathological characteristics was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following logopedic and rehabilitation treatment, a high degree of diversity in the results obtained was observed in three patients (one of the patients was absent from successive checks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most interesting phenomenon was the difference in time necessary to rehabilitate the swallowing reflex only after which it was possible to reassume oral alimentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After two months of physiokinesitherapy, computerized static posturography, which initially revealed a sharp increase in the number of oscillations, showed a partial improvement of the postural disease with a reduction in oscillation amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even though the number of case followed was limited, our experience encourages us to underline importance of immediate rehabilitation therapy and of the collaboration of patients and their family members </plain></SENT>
