<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine subjects were examined; their clinical diagnoses included perioperative nerve injury, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and lateral medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resting activity, motor unit action potential (MUAP) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and MUAP recruitment were evaluated in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records (excluding EMG data) were analyzed for clinical evidence of LMN or UMN dysfunction in the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and pharynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of LMN dysfunction rested on clinical data consistent with cranial nerve injury, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032371" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">poliomyelitis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e>, or unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Criteria for UMN dysfunction included previous cerebral (not brainstem) infarction or mass lesion or the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electromyographic abnormalities were significantly associated with LMN dysfunction (p less than .05), but they were not significantly associated with UMN dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the parameters tested, MUAP recruitment was the most sensitive (82%) and specific (92%) </plain></SENT>
