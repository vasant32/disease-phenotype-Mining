<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only patients with a lesion on MRI appropriate to the clinical syndrome were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had an infarction of the pons, bilateral in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional 5 patients had an infarction of the dorsolateral medulla oblongata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with hemispheric lesions were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the 5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> showed delayed R2 components to stimulation ipsilateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional loss of the ipsilateral R1 component was observed in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 20 patients with pontine infarctions had pathological blink reflexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients with a unilateral pons lesion and an abnormality of R1 had this abnormality on the side contralateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases with bilateral pontine infarction R1 was abnormal on one side or on either side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 11 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> R1, 6 had isolated abnormalities of R2 without consistent correlation to the side of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that abnormalities of the blink reflex are of minor localizing value in pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be explained by the fact that a pontine infarction affects either the reflex arch itself or descending pathways that have a modulating influence on the reflex arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Infarctions of the medulla oblongata, however, have characteristic abnormalities that have already been described </plain></SENT>
