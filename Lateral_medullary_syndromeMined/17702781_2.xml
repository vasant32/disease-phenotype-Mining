<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To present three cases of young adults with lateral medullary ischaemic events associated with a hypoplastic vertebral artery (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients had two additional atherosclerotic or non-atherosclerotic risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One female, aged 40 years, and two males, aged 38 and 37 years, each with two risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, presented to the emergency department with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and findings consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients underwent emergency CT scan of the brain followed by MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CT scans were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed a lateral medullary lesion in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients had a hypoplastic VA ipsilateral to the clinical ischaemic event on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>Hypoplasia</z:mpath> of VA is not considered a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as it is a common variant in up to 75% of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in our patients, hypoplastic VA coexisted with two risk factors and resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus although a hypoplastic VA may not be an uncommon asymptomatic finding, it may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> if additional risk factors are present </plain></SENT>
