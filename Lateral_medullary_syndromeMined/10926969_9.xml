<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> has been associated with a variety of diseases affecting the brain stem but has only rarely been reported after brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism is thought to involve increased sympathetic activity and baroreflex dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook microneurographic recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MNSA) during beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) monitoring to investigate this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We investigated a 75-year-old woman who developed paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BP 220/110 mm Hg) after a large left-sided medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The paroxysms were triggered by changes in posture and were accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001064'>diaphoresis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> were substantially increased (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> level, 23.9 nmol/L 9 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level, &lt;3.8 nmol/L), and heart rate variability, measured by spectral analysis, was decreased in both low- and high-frequency domains (0.04 and 0.06 ms(2), respectively; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level, 0.14+/-0.02 ms(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MNSA was increased in frequency (61 bursts per minute; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level, 34+/-18 bursts per minute), and the burst amplitude was not inversely related to diastolic BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BP and MNSA responses to cold pressor and isometric handgrip stimuli were intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extensive unilateral infarction of the brain stem in the region of the nucleus tractus solitarius may result in partial baroreflex dysfunction, increased sympathetic activity, and neurogenic paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
