<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, before reaching the structures generating LEPs, laser stimuli can induce effects at a subcortical level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined LEPs and laser-induced prepulse inhibition of the blink reflex in seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> within a month after the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had abnormally elevated thresholds for temperature and pain sensation, and for pinprick pain induced by laser stimuli, in the affected vs the non-affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LEPs to stimulation of the affected side were abnormal because of absent, reduced or delayed responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the same laser stimuli that were unable to induce LEPs generated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> inhibition of the blink reflex response when applied 250ms before a trigeminal nerve electrical stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage inhibition induced in the R2 response of the blink reflex by laser stimulation of the affected side was not different from that induced by stimulation of the non-affected side, or in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are compatible with either a different pathway for prepulse inhibition and evoked potentials or a reduced energy requirement of the sensory input generating prepulse inhibition in comparison to that generating evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
