<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied electro-oculographic and videotape recordings of eye movements in six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With fixation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a spontaneous rotatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> with the fast phase directed toward the intact side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With loss of fixation, the patients' eyes deviated tonically toward the side of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Voluntary and involuntary saccades had larger amplitude when directed toward the side of the lesion than away from it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> predictably interacted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> slow eye movements, producing asymmetric smooth-pursuit, optokinetic, and vestibular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, smooth-pursuit and optokinetic responses were decreased significantly in both directions compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fixation suppression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010542'>vestibular nystagmus</z:hpo> also was impaired in both directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that two different types of oculomotor bias were present in these patients--a velocity bias and a position bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The former resulted from damage to the caudal lateral vestibular nuclei, and the latter from interruption of cerebellopontine pathways </plain></SENT>
