<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral bulbar syndrome</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is usually of vascular origin, due to a reduction in postero inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and vertebral artery blood flow.CASE REPORT: We studied two cases: a woman aged 59 years and a man of 49 years, who were admitted with Wallenberg s syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed on magnetic resonance which showed an ischaemic lesion in the lateral bulbar region ipsilateral to the clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On angioresonance there was lack of filling of the vertebral artery involved, and the PICA was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At the present time, the most sensitive technique available for the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral bulbar syndrome</z:e> is cranial magnetic resonance (it even appears to be useful for making aetiopathogenic hypotheses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, arteriography is widely used for assessing disorders of the posterior cerebral circulation, although it is not without risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to recent studies, angioresonance gives sensitivity and specificity of over 75% when used to assess anomalies of the vertebral and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>So our observations corroborate the finding that angioresonance is a very sensitive, specific investigation for showing disorders of the vertebral arteries and PICA, which spares patients the morbidity associated with conventional arteriography </plain></SENT>
