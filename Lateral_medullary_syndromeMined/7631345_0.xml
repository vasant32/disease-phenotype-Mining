<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted between 1991 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The localization of lesions was evaluated by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic technique was used to assess cerebral blood flow by two methods (133Xe and hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi>) on five slices of brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow values were calculated in 11 regions of interest in each cerebral hemisphere and in the cerebellum and were compared with those obtained in 20 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients had selective lateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>: Relative reduction of flow (133Xe) and of tracer uptake (HMPAO) were observed in one patient in the ipsilateral cerebellum and contralateral hemisphere; in two patients, hemispheric flow values were relatively low, without significant asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients also presented with cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>: Flow drop was severe in the ipsilateral cerebellum, and contralateral reduction in the brain hemisphere was observed in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> can be associated with ipsilateral reduction of flow in the cerebellum, but this phenomenon is inconstant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe flow drop suggests infarction in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contralateral hemispheric flow reduction can also be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These phenomena of cerebellar and crossed hemispheric diaschisis are probably related to lesions of tracts from the olivary and reticular nuclei </plain></SENT>
