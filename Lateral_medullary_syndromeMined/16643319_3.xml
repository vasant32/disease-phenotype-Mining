<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 1350 patients with posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in our registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included patients if the diagnosis of AICA territory involvement was confirmed, and DWI, and magnetic resonance angiography were obtained in the 3 days of symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential feeding arteries of the AICA territory were evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a three-dimensional rotating cineoangiographic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 23 consecutive patients with lesion involving AICA territory, six with isolated lesion in the AICA territory, six with posterior inferior cerebellar artery, 11 with multiple posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (MPCIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical feature of isolated AICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e>, lateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gaze palsy</z:e>, and sensory-motor deficits in patients with pontine involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with largest lesion extending to the anterior and inferolateral cerebellum showed mixed symptomatology of the lateral medullary (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>) and AICA territory involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with MPCIs presented various clinical pictures with consciousness disturbances and diverse clinical signs because of involvement of different anatomical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large-artery atherosclerotic disease in the vertebrobasilar system was the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 12 (52%) patients, cardioembolism (CE) in one (4%), and coexisting large-artery disease and a source of CE in four (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was atheromatous vertebrobasilar artery disease either in the distal vertebral or proximal basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The outcome was usually good except those with multiple lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The new MRI techniques and clinical correlations allow better definition of the diverse topographical and etiological spectrum of AICA territory involvement and associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> which was previously based on pathological and conventional MRI studies </plain></SENT>
