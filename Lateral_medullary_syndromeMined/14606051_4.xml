<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the vertebral artery generally presents as alternating syndromes, of which Wallenberg s syndrome, either complete or incomplete, is the most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we review the literature published to date on the pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical features, chronopathology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a young patient who suffered from incomplete Wallenberg s syndrome a few hours after a single session of cervical chiropractic manipulation, and we also show the resonance images that were used to support the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of a pain in the neck and neurological symptoms in a patient who has undergone chiropractic manipulation in the last few hours or days must lead us to consider a possible dissection of the cervical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the vertebral artery usually gives rise to alternating syndromes, the most frequent of which is lateral bulbomedullary infarction or Wallenberg s syndrome due to proximal occlusion of the posteroinferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography of the supra aortic trunks and cranial magnetic resonance scanning are valid techniques for demonstrating the dissection of the artery and the associated ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
