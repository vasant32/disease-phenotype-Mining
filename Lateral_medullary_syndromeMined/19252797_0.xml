<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Numerous crossed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem syndromes</z:e> have been described, especially in the nineteenth century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While these syndromes are passed on in neurological textbooks, their relevance in clinical neurology remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the prevalence of classical crossed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem syndromes</z:e> in clinical practice, we prospectively recruited 308 consecutive patients with signs and symptoms indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardized high-resolution <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and multimodal electrophysiological brain stem testing were applied to localize the site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a computer-based correlation of clinical signs and symptoms of our patients to those reported in the original historical publications for more than 25 crossed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases matched the clinical criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, two patients had Babinski-Nageotte's syndrome, two had Raymond-Cestan's, one showed Weber's, and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Claude's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other tested syndromes were not present in the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 20% of patients showed different, so far unnamed crossed symptom combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, classical crossed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem syndromes</z:e> do not seem to play a relevant role in clinical neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other syndromes may serve as theoretical models only that illustrate possible neuroanatomical connections in the human brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is complicated, however, by considerable topographic and terminological inconsistencies </plain></SENT>
