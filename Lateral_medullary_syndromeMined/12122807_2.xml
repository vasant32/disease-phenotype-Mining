<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most classic articles of 19th-century American neurologists were initial or early descriptions of clinical conditions, diseases, or procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These include descriptions by Beard of the Jumping Frenchmen of Maine; by Sachs of "amaurotic family <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020796" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">idiocy</z:e>" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="TSD">Tay-Sachs disease</z:e>); by Hun of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e>; by Mitchell of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">phantom limbs</z:e>; and by Dana of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Few of these were the initial description, although most were clear and fairly complete by modern standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several citation classics were cited mainly as a point of comparison with later events or developments, including those by Corning on spinal anesthesia, Bartholow on electrical stimulation of the brain, Mitchell on the status of American psychiatry, and Starr on childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reports of Corning, Bartholow, and Mitchell have been the subjects of continued controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only examples of basic neuroscience among the citation classics are the classic studies by Onuf and Collins involving ablation of portions of the sympathetic chain in cats, and Onuf's description of the nucleus of Onuf in the human spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Onuf's basic science work was made possible by a unique and short-lived multidisciplinary research environment created at the New York State Pathological Institute for the scientific investigation of insanity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
