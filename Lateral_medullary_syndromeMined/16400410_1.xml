<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between facial sensory abnormalities and lesional topography in eight patients with lateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LMIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We reviewed eight sequential cases of LMIs admitted to the Neurology Division of Hospital das Clínicas/São Paulo University between July, 2001 and August, 2002 except for one patient who had admitted in 1996 and was still followed in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were submitted to conventional brain MRI including axial T1-, T2-weighted and Fluid attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRIs were evaluated blindly to clinical features to determine extension of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to presumed topographies of the ventral trigeminothalamic (VTT), lateral spinothalamic, spinal trigeminal tracts and spinal trigeminal nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensory symptoms or signs were ipsilateral to the bulbar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 3 patients, contralateral in 4 and bilateral in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our cases with exclusive contralateral facial sensory symptoms, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had medial extensions that included the VTT topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases with exclusive ipsilateral facial sensory abnormalities, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affected lateral and posterior bulbar portions, with slight or no medial extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only patient who presented bilateral facial symptoms had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> that covered both medial and lateral, in addition to the posterior region of the medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show a correlation between medial extension of LMIs and presence of contralateral facial sensory symptoms </plain></SENT>
