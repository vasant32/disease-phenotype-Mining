<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, it may cause mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous VAD related to abrupt neck position change, sudden sneezing, or severe cough and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> after fish bone <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp> are rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report describes three cases of spontaneous VAD due to seemingly harmless events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: The first patient developed vertebro-basilar ischemic symptoms after suddenly turning his head to the left during an argument with a colleague </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second suffered from right lateral medullary infarction after sudden sneezing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third developed left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> after she tried to extract a fish bone in her throat, which induced severe cough and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe neck pain with posterior circulation ischemic symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), and conventional angiography confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and recovered well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other two cases received heparinization and then oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, and recovered without residual neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, VAD should be among the differentials considered when encountering young patients presentation with such clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
