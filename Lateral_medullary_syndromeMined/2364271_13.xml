<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a single focal area of pathological signal intensity in the (dorso)-lateral medulla suggesting infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2 of these 9 patients and in 3 further patients with no medullary signs, the infarction involved the cerebellar territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acutely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> (except 1) had saccadic lateropulsion and spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> in light with the horizontal fast component beating to the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The velocity of the slow drift to the side of the lesion was dependent on eye position and induced a characteristic asymmetry of the visually and vestibularly elicited slow eye movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In most patients smooth pursuit, optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> and visual suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex were still impaired when this spontaneous drift was minimal or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The oculomotor disturbances in patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> are compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following conclusions are made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(1) The spontaneous drift that is dependent on eye position is mostly created by 'ocular lateropulsion', that is, a tonic bias within the oculomotor system which may have several sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) The abnormalities and asymmetries of oculomotor responses during visual-vestibular stimulation cannot solely be explained by this spontaneous drift and its interaction with otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eye movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Instead, structures and pathways are damaged in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> which mediate visual and/or motor signals important for the cerebellar control of visually-guided slow eye movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(3) Damage to these pathways occurs in the lateral medulla, as the MRI findings show that in most patients the cerebellum is rarely involved, but no definite conclusion can be made as to which of the fibres travelling in the inferior peduncle to the cerebellum may be interrupted </plain></SENT>
