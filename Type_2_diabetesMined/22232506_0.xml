<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A longitudinal comparative design measured the effect of a yoga intervention on yoga practice and physical activity, using data at baseline and postintervention months 3, 6, and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disparate patterns of yoga practice occurred between intervention and control participants over time, but the subjective definition of yoga practice limits interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multilevel model estimates indicated that treatment group did not have a significant influence in the rate of change in physical activity over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While age and education were not significant individual predictors, the inclusion of these variables in the model did improve fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that an 8-week yoga intervention had little effect on physical activity over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research is necessary to explore the influence of yoga on behavioral health outcomes among individuals with or at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
