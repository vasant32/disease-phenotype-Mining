<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the possibility of NAFLD adversely influencing the therapeutic effect afforded by DPP-4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetic patients was suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: A total of 20 type 2 DM patients with NAFLD and 85 type 2 DM patients without NAFLD were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> at the dose of 50 mg/day for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The change in HbA1c from the baseline following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was -0.47% (4 weeks), -0.73% (8 weeks) and -0.88% (12 weeks) in the type 2 DM patients with NAFLD and -0.26% (4 weeks), -0.41% (8 weeks) and -0.49% (12 weeks) in type 2 DM without NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes in the HbA1c from the baseline after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment for 8 and 12 weeks were significantly greater in type 2 DM patients with NAFLD than in type 2 DM patients without NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that NAFLD might adversely affect the therapeutic effect afforded by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment in patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NAFLD may be an independent predictor of the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
