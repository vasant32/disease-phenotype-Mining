<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Changes in NCV were surveyed over 10 years in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients to clarify the time-course relationships between NCV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> stage and between NCV and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the natural course of diabetic sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (DSPN) was discussed based on the findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a simple NCV measurement device, NCV (MCV and SCV) was measured once a year over 10 years in 474 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were grouped based on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> stage and HbA1c level in the course to investigate the time-course relationships between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> stage and NCV and between HbA1c and NCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> stage and NCV reduction were strongly correlated, and NCV decreased as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On comparison of time-course NCV among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> stages, continuity of NCV reduction along with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> progression was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the relationship between HbA1c and NCV, NCV reduction was moderate in the group maintaining HbA1c at a relatively favorable level, but morbid reduction of NCV could not be prevented even though favorable control was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NCV reduction is strongly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> progression from more than 10 years before its manifestation through reaching proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was also suggested that NCV reduction can be attenuated by controlling blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but the reduction cannot be prevented completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, DSPN is a progressive complication that starts from an early phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and steadily aggravates, keeping step with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> aggravation, and it may be difficult to completely prevent the progression </plain></SENT>
