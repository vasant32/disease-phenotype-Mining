<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fatty acid composition in milk fat, the duration of ripening, and the complexity of the food matrices are important factors that may interfere with the physiological impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we treated genetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic mice (db/db) for 4 weeks with different dairy (cheese-based) products, differing by the duration of ripening (0, 15, or 35 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that 35 days ripened product significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp>, an effect associated with a decreased adipose tissue <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> markers (TBARS and NAPDH-oxidase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression), without affecting body weight, food intake, and fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both fermented matrices significantly decreased the hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content, without modifying plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> or plasma total cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that dairy products issued from longer ripening positively impact <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo>, and adipose tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
