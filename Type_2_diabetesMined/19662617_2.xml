<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trials in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> have highlighted the role of physical activity/exercise in the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, physical activity and exercise training have been recognized as treatment options for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both aerobic and resistance training were shown to produce beneficial effects by reducing HbA(1c), inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improving fat distribution, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and blood pressure in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mixed aerobic and resistance training was recently shown to be more effective than either one alone in ameliorating HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, further research is needed to establish the volume, intensity and type of exercise that are required to reduce cardiovascular burden and particularly to define the best strategy for promoting long-term compliance and durable lifestyle changes in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Italian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Exercise Study (IDES) is a prospective Italian multicentre randomized controlled trial, of larger size and longer duration than previously published trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It has been designed to assess the combined effect of structured counselling and supervised mixed (aerobic plus resistance) exercise training, as compared with counselling alone, on HbA(1c) and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> as well as fitness parameters in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study was also aimed at testing a sustainable strategy for promoting and maintaining a sufficient level of physical activity among individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to be implemented at the population level </plain></SENT>
