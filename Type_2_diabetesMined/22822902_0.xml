<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin replacement is one of many treatment options that can help to bring about near normoglycemia in the patient with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control as close to normoglycemia as possible can help to reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications, yet less than one-half of patients with T2DM achieve glycemic targets as recommended by practice guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to provide guidance to primary care physicians for the initiation and intensification of basal-bolus insulin therapy in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two treatment algorithms that can be both patient- and physician-driven are proposed: a stepwise approach and a multiple daily injections approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence shaping the two approaches will be discussed alongside management issues that surround the patient treated with insulin: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, patient education, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
