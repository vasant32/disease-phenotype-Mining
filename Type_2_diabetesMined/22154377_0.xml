<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients, in age-range 18-70 years, were selected and divided into 2 groups: (1) conventional periodontal scaling and root planing+controlled mechanic; (2) conventional periodontal scaling and root planing+controlled mechanical+maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analyses were performed on day 0, 180 and 720 days, including plaque index, gingival index, probing depth and clinical attachment level, and evaluation of total cholesterol and its fractions, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups presented significant reduction in clinical periodontal parameters, however, probing depth did not diminish significantly only in Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blood parameters in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that after 720 days of the experiment, there were significant improvements in clinical and blood parameters, in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group that received maintenance therapy also showed a more expressive improvement in clinical periodontal parameters, in general, suggesting that this therapy is important and necessary in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
