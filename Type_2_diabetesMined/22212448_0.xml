<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Although pravastatin has known pleiotropic effects against adverse cardiovascular conditions, little is known about its effects on endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF)-mediated signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the effects of pravastatin on the production of and responses to EDCF in superior mesenteric arteries isolated from rats at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Contractions to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) were examined in superior mesenteric artery rings from aged type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats (56-60 weeks old), from control age-matched non-diabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats and from pravastatin-treated (10 mg kg(-1) , p.o., daily for 4 weeks) OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mesenteric artery expressions of cyclo-oxygenases (COXs), microsomal-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi> synthases (mPGESs), RhoA and Rho-kinase proteins, and also the level of phosphorylated ezrin, radixin and moesin (PERM), a substrate for Rho-kinase, were detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arteries from OLETF rats exhibited (vs. LETO rats) (1) enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced EDCF-mediated contractions, which were inhibited by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632, (2) reductions in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-stimulated release of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and (3) increased COX-1 and PERM protein expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mesenteric arteries from OLETF rats treated with pravastatin exhibited (vs. untreated OLETF) (1) reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced contraction, (2) suppressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) production and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation and (3) reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced PERM protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pravastatin exerts beneficial effects against abnormal EDCF signalling by suppressing Rho-kinase and promoting <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity in the mesenteric arteries of rats at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
