<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> can increase adiponectin levels and improve insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the associations between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the adiponectin (45T/G) and adiponectin receptor-2 gene (795G/A), and investigated whether these genetic variants affect the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in Iranian patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 128 non-diabetic participants and 101 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for 45T/G and 795G/A with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> for 12 weeks, after which we compared laboratory parameters in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood sugar differed significantly in individuals with different 795G/A genotypes after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean decrease in insulin/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio after treatment also differed significantly in individuals with different 45T/G genotypes (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T allele frequency for 45T/G was 87.11% in controls versus 81.68% in patients (P = 0.071) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TG and GG genotypes were more frequent in patients (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The G allele frequency for 795G/A was 76.17% in controls versus 80.20% in patients (P = 0.179) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>795G/A variants were not significantly different between patient and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The adiponectin gene 45T/G mutation may be an important determinant of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Iranian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, adiponectin 45T/G and adiponectin receptor-2 795G/A polymorphisms were not significantly associated with the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in our sample </plain></SENT>
