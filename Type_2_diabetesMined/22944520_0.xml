<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Presence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> (SAF), defined as coincidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001629'>abnormal heart rate</z:mp> turbulence and abnormal deceleration capacity, identifies a group of patients with very poor prognosis among post-infarction patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, factors contributing to development of SAF are entirely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to identify clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic factors predicting SAF in a consecutive cohort of diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2010 and July 2011, we prospectively enrolled 97 patients with insulin-dependent type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and stable CAD in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart rate turbulence (as marker of autonomic reflex activity) and deceleration capacity (as marker of autonomic tonic activity) were calculated from 24-hour Holter recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis included duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, level of HbA(1c), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, presence of multivessel disease, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten (10.3%) of the 97 patients exhibited signs of SAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with SAF were characterized by longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (25 years vs 15 years), higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> (70% vs. 36%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (80% vs 45%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (90% vs 55%), significantly higher levels of HbA(1c) (9.0% vs 7.4%; P = .002) and a lower LVEF (30% vs.55%; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis, LVEF â‰¤35% and HbA(1c) &gt;8% were the only factors which were independently associated with SAF (odds ratios of 23.1 [95% CI, 1.8-287.0]; P = .015 and 6.6 [1.1-40.1]; P = .043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In patients with insulin-dependent type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and CAD, presence of SAF correlates with both glycemic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Impaired LVEF and increased level of HbA(1c) were independently associated with SAF </plain></SENT>
