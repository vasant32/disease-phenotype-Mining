<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The present study evaluated the efficacy of biphasic human insulin 30 (BHI 30) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients who had failed in therapy with two or more oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This open-label, nonrandomized, 4-month, multicenter, clinical observational study was conducted in Shanghai, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 660 insulin-naive type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with poor glycemic control (glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> [HbA1c] ≥7.5%), despite treatment with two or more OADs for more than 6 months, were recruited and received BHI 30 monotherapy or BHI 30 plus OAD(s) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> only, α-glucosidase inhibitor only, or both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 660 subjects, 644 completed the 4-month study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study, the median level of HbA1c decreased by 2.0% (from 9.1% to 7.0%) in the BHI 30 monotherapy group and also 2.0% (from 9.5% to 7.3%) in the BHI 30 plus OAD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More patients achieved the HbA1c &lt;7.0% target in the BHI 30 monotherapy group than in the BHI 30 plus OAD(s) group (47.9% vs. 35.3%, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the expenses of the prior treatment strategy, the median daily cost decreased by 39.8% (4.5 yuan, Chinese RMB) at the end point in the BHI 30 monotherapy group but increased by 20.0% (2.2 yuan) in the BHI 30 plus OAD(s) group (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients in the BHI 30 plus OAD(s) group had fewer minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> than in the BHI 30 monotherapy group (mean of 1.06 vs. 2.77 per patient per year, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term BHI 30 therapy can improve glycemic control in insulin-naive type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients after failure of two or more OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With higher baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, the BHI 30 plus OAD(s) group had lower pharmacoeconomic efficacy than the BHI 30 monotherapy group despite having fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
