<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and progressive disease, and ultimately, most patients will require insulin therapy for the optimization of their glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Areas covered: We review the recent literature investigating the efficacy and safety of the insulin analogue lispro in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relevant publications were identified by means of a PubMed literature search in the period January 1990 to May 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which included at least one arm evaluating insulin lispro in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expert opinion: Insulin is the most effective therapy for reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>: when the desired decrease of HbA1c is â‰¥ 1.5%, it is unlikely than any other antidiabetes drug may work as better as insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of lispro analogues offer discrete advantage over human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results of comparative RCTs versus insulin glargine or insulin detemir indicate that insulin lispro protamine suspension (ILPS) has a similar effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> while using lower doses when injected once a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lispro/ILPS premixed formulations can be injected immediately before a meal because they are absorbed more rapidly than premixed human insulin, thus allowing more flexibility with insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
