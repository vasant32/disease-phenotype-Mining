<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Quasi-experimental using pretest, posttest comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community locations including schools, churches, and senior centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventeen people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Series of classes for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their family members that incorporated Social Cognitive Theory tenets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The classes featured current nutrition recommendations for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and hands-on cooking, where participants prepared and ate a meal together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three-day food records, completed prior to attending cooking schools and 1 month after, were used to measure changes in energy intake and selected nutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ANALYSIS: Program efficacy was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare differences between pre-training and post-training variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ANCOVA was used to determine whether program efficacy was affected by sociodemographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants decreased (P &lt; .05) intakes of energy, fat grams, percentage of calories from fat, saturated fat grams, cholesterol (mg), <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (mg), and carbohydrate grams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Nutrition education incorporating hands-on cooking can improve nutrient intake in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
