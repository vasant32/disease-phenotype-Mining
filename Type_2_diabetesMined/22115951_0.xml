<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Today, greater than 90% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When uncontrolled, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> may result in comorbidities such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, immune system dysfunction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, bariatric operations are associated with sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in contrast to nonsurgical options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect of bariatric operations is likely due to the improvement in the hormonal dysregulation associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
