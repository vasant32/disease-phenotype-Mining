<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The evidences illustrating the effects of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation (FAS) in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) levels and glycemic control have been contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to systematically search and quantitatively analyze the effect of FAS on tHcy levels and HbA1c compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Embase up to March 2012 without language restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Key words "<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>" and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>" with slight modifications based on the sources for search strategy were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>References of initially identified articles were examined to identify any other relevant studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A random-effects model was used for estimation the pooled effect estimates (weighted mean different, WMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 6185 studies identified, 4 studies with 183 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FAS had statistically significant effect on tHcy levels [WMD, -3.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), -4.44 to -2.60] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the effect on HbA1c levels [WMD, -0.37; 95% CI, -1.10 to 0.35] was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">Folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation in patient with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> may reduce tHcy levels and have a trend to associate with better glycemic control compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further longitudinal studies on these intervention and outcomes are warranted </plain></SENT>
