<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incretins stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and inhibit glucagon secretion from pancreatic α-cells, which is favorable for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> is released on December, 2009, in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied effects of 6-month-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, blood pressure, body weight and renal function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by a chart-based analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 220 type 2 diabetic patients who have taken <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> for 6 months by a chart-based analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects studied include patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> monotherapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> add-on therapy, and switching from glinide to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We selected patients who have both data before and after 6-month <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment and compared the data before the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment with the data at 6 month after the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body weight, blood pressure, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c), serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and estimated glomerular filtration rate in type 2 diabetic patients were measured almost at the same time points before and after 6-month-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Body weight was significantly reduced after 6-month <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment by 0.8 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels were also significantly decreased after the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment by 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found a significant and negative correlation between change in body weight and body mass index at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also observed a significant and negative correlation between change in HbA1c and HbA1c levels at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of patients who showed the absence of urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly increased after the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
