<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has become evident that a concomitant increase in stiffness of both plasma and erythrocyte membranes may decrease the microcirculatory flow, leading ultimately to tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, insufficient tissue nutrition, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific microvascular pathology </plain></SENT>
