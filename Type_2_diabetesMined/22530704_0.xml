<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> presents challenges because of co-morbidities and the potential increase in the risk of adverse effects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because elderly patients often have impaired renal and hepatic function, careful considerations must be made when selecting appropriate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are a number of potential safety issues associated with various <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapies that are relevant to elderly patients, including increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> exacerbations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and contraindications of some agents in patients with hepatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrant colesevelam HCl is unique compared with other <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapies because it is the only product approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, to lower both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, colesevelam has been shown to have similar <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy in patients aged &lt;65 years and those aged â‰¥65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colesevelam was not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, was associated with a low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, and can be safely combined with a broad range of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and insulin) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Currently, colesevelam is available in tablet form and as a powder for oral suspension formulation; the latter may be of benefit to elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>swallowing difficulties</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As colesevelam has both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering effects, its use may reduce the drug burden in elderly patients receiving multiple agents for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering </plain></SENT>
