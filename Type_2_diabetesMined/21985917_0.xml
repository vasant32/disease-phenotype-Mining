<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we aimed to show the relationship between NEIL1 mutation and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted 70 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the control group consisted of 50 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 53±11 yr and 49±11 yr, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two NEIL1 mutations (2.9%) were detected in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was A→G change (133A→G) at the 133. position of the 8th exon with 257 bp length in base sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no mutation in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We searched NEIL1 gene mutation for the first time in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mutation was "silent" as it did not cause any amino acid change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of these mutations on the etiopathogenesis of disease are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the lysine encoded by AAG was identical to the lysine encoded by AAA, it is not clear if they have functional differences due to the changing environmental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NEIL1 gene mutation may have causative role in the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
