<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most current guidelines recommend more aggressive treatment goals with blood pressure (BP) targets of &lt; 130/80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective data analyses suggest an association between a lower BP and slower declines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) as well as greater cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such recommendations, however, are not supported by appropriately powered prospective outcome trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, several important questions regarding aggressive lowering of BP levels are still unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major limitations of most existing clinical trials of BP lowering in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is the failure to either target or achieve mean systolic BP values below 130 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from more recent randomized trials that evaluated different levels of BP do not support a BP below 130/80 mmHg as providing further CV risk reduction and compared to levels below 140/90 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One consistent benefit of a lower BP level, however, is on reduction of cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is reasonable evidence that a lower BP level does further <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of advanced proteinuric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> such that a BP goal &lt; 130/80 mmHg is defensible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This review examines the data for and against aggressive BP lowering in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
