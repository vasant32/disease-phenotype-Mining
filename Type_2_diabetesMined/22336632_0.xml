<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the antialbuminuric advantage of cilnidipine, an N/L-type <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> (CCB), compared with L-type CCBs in diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was a multicenter, non-randomized crossover trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were 90 type 2 diabetic patients exhibiting either normo- or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, and undergoing CCB treatment for â‰¥6 months prior to study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CCB at the time of entry was continued for the first 6 months (Period 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was subsequently switched from cilnidipine to an L-type CCB, or vice versa, for the second 6-month observation period (Period 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During Period 1, the L-type CCB group showed a significant increase of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) over time, while the cilnidipine group showed no significant elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During Period 2, switching of the treatment from the L-type CCB to cilnidipine resulted in significant reduction of the UAE, whereas switching from cilnidipine to the L-type CCB resulted in no significant change in the UAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that the antialbuminuric effect of Cilnidipine, but not the L-type CCBs, was sustained even in patients treated for a long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the antialbuminuric effect can be anticipated after switching from an L-type CCB to cilnidipine, but not vice versa </plain></SENT>
