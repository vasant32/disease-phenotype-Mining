<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine differences in hypothalamic expression levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (AgRP), and α<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> in the infundibular nucleus, the human equivalent of the arcuate nucleus, in relation to body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression in the infundibular nucleus of eight subjects diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was measured to determine possible interference of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with the association observed between neuropeptides and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We studied AgRP, NPY, and α<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> expression by means of quantitative immunocytochemistry in postmortem hypothalami of 30 subjects with known BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments, we compared neuropeptide expression in eight subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with eight matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that AgRP immunoreactivity showed a U-shaped correlation with BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evidence was found for possible influences of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NPY immunoreactivity was significantly lower in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects. α<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> did not correlate with BMI but was significantly lower in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, NPY and AgRP expression was not affected in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the expression of AgRP and NPY are correlated with body weight changes, rather than the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas changes in α<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> immunoreactivity are related to the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, indicating separate hypothalamic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
