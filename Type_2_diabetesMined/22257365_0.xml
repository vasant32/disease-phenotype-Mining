<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition globally that results in extensive morbidity, decreased quality of life, and increased health services utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle changes can prevent the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but require patient engagement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk testing might represent a new tool to increase patients' motivation for lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the rationale, development, and design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the clinical and personal utility of incorporating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk testing into comprehensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk assessments performed in a primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: Patients are recruited in the laboratory waiting areas of two primary care clinics and enrolled into one of three study arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those interested in genetic risk testing are randomized to receive either a standard risk assessment (SRA) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incorporating conventional risk factors plus upfront disclosure of the results of genetic risk testing ("SRA+G" arm), or the SRA alone ("SRA" arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants not interested in genetic risk testing will not receive the test, but will receive SRA (forming a third, "no-test" arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk counseling is provided by clinic staff (not study staff external to the clinic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference are measured at baseline and 12 months, as are patients' self-reported behavioral and emotional responses to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes are changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and BMI after 12 months; secondary outcomes include changes in diet patterns, physical activity, waist circumference, and perceived risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The utility, feasibility, and efficacy of providing patients with genetic risk information for common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases in primary care remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study described here will help to establish whether providing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk information in a primary care setting can help improve patients' clinical outcomes, risk perceptions, and/or their engagement in healthy behavior change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, study design features such as the use of existing clinic personnel for risk counseling could inform the future development and implementation of care models for the use of individual genetic risk information in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00849563 </plain></SENT>
