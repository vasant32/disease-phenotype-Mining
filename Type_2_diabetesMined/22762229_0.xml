<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Young Indigenous people living in remote areas appear to be at excess risk of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most young Indigenous people with T2DM are asymptomatic at diagnosis and typically have a family history of T2DM, are overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and may have signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> is usually during early adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Barriers to addressing T2DM in young Indigenous people living in rural and remote settings relate to health service access, demographics, socioeconomic factors, cultural factors, and limited resources at individual and health service levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recommend screening for T2DM for any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person aged &gt; 10 years (or past the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of puberty) who is overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, has a positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, has signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, has received psychotropic therapy, or has been exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individualised management plans should include identification of risk factors, complications, behavioural factors and treatment targets, and should take into account psychosocial factors which may influence health care interaction, treatment success and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preventive strategies, including lifestyle modification, need to play a dominant role in tackling T2DM in young Indigenous people </plain></SENT>
