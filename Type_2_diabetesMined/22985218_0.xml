<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: A pretest-posttest design with a nonequivalent control group was utilized to recruit 59 diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> from an outpatient clinic of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standardized Tai Chi for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> program was provided, which comprised 1 hour of Tai Chi per session, twice a week for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome variables were fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, the Semmes-Weinstein 10-g monofilament examination scores and total symptom scores for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, single leg stance for balance, and the Korean version of the SF-36v2 for quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients completed the posttest measures after the 12-week Tai Chi intervention, giving a 34% dropout rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: The mean age of the participants was 64 years, and they had been diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for more than 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The status was significantly better for the participants in the Tai Chi group (n=20) than for their control (i.e., nonintervention) counterparts (n=19) in terms of total symptom scores, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, balance, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Tai Chi improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, balance, neuropathic symptoms, and some dimensions of quality of life in diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies with larger samples and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm the effects of Tai Chi on the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e>, which may have an impact on fall prevention in this population </plain></SENT>
