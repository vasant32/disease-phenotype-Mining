<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven healthy control subjects and 11 age- and sex-matched patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> controlled with lifestyle modifications or oral anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dynamic cerebral autoregulation was calculated by the autoregressive moving average autoregulatory index from a continuous blood pressure and R-R interval (time between each ventricular systole) recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End-tidal carbon dioxide was also monitored and changes in response to breath holding and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> as a metabolic stimulus were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were seen in cerebral blood flow velocity at baseline, or in response to breath holding between people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control subjects, although the cerebral blood flow velocity response associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> was significantly reduced in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in dynamic cerebral autoregulation were seen at baseline or in response to respiratory manoeuvres between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic cerebral autoregulation is not impaired in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although a small difference could not be excluded as the study was only powered to detect an autoregulatory index difference &gt; 2 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further study in a larger population with a spectrum of disease severity may reveal clinically important differences </plain></SENT>
