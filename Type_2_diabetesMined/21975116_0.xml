<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There is controversial evidence regarding the levels of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> molecules in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the gene expression of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes in the gingival tissue of poorly and well-controlled type 2 diabetic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> (CP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Gingival biopsies were harvested from systemically and periodontally healthy subjects (n=12), systemically healthy subjects with CP (n=15), well-controlled (n=8) and poorly controlled (n=14) diabetic subjects with CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) levels of peroxiredoxin (PRDX) 1 and 2, catalase (CAT), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPX1) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) 1 and 2 were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that PRDX1 and GPX1 were up-regulated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05), independently of the glycaemic status, whilst PRDX2 and SOD2 genes were slightly influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>, but significantly induced when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> was associated with DM, especially under a poor glycaemic control (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CAT and SOD1 expressions were not significantly influenced by any of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, both PRDX1 and GPX1 were overexpressed in CP whilst PRDX2 and SOD2 were up-regulated especially in the poorly controlled diabetic group with CP </plain></SENT>
