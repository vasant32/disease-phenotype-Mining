<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SDT-fa/fa rat shows <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> at a young age compared to the Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT-+/+) rat; however, bone abnormalities in the SDT-fa/fa rat have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on bone turnover, bone mass, and bone strength in the SDT-fa/fa rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were used as control animals, and SDT-+/+ rats were used as non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum osteocalcin and urine deoxypyridinoline levels were decreased in SDT-fa/fa rats compared to control rats at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SDT-fa/fa rats showed decreases in bone mineral density and bone mineral content of the whole tibia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006436'>shortening of the tibia</z:hpo> and femur compared to control and SDT-+/+ rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deterioration in bone geometrical properties of the femur midshaft such as cortical thickness and minimum moment of inertia, was observed in SDT-fa/fa rats compared to control and SDT-+/+ rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur was decreased in SDT-fa/fa rats compared to control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These negative effects on bone in SDT-fa/fa rats caused severe decreases in maximum load, stiffness, and energy absorption of the femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, a candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002659'>bone fragility</z:hpo> markers, were elevated in SDT-fa/fa rats compared to control and SDT-+/+ rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the SDT-fa/fa rat may be a useful model to investigate bone abnormalities in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
