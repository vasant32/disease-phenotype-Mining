<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase and γ-glutamyltransferase were measured in a randomly selected, population-based cohort of 1066 men and women aged 60-75 years with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (the Edinburgh Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 29.1% (95% CI 26.1-31.8) of patients had one or more plasma liver enzymes above the upper limit of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 10.1% of these patients had a prior history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> and a further 12.4% reported alcohol intake above recommended limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alanine aminotransferase was the most commonly raised liver enzyme (23.1% of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver enzymes</z:hpo> was significantly higher in men (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.83), in the youngest 5-year age band (odds ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.44-2.84), in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration &lt; 5 years (odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.90), plasma HbA(1c) ≥ 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.88), <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> BMI (odds ratio 2.84, 95% CI 1.59-3.06) and secondary care management for their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.05-1.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these factors combined accounted for only 7.6% of the variation in liver enzyme abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated liver enzymes</z:hpo> in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is high, with only modest variation between clinically defined patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research is required to determine the prognostic value of raised, routinely measured liver enzymes to inform decisions on appropriate follow-up investigations </plain></SENT>
