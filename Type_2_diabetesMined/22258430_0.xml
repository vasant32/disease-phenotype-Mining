<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated diffuse <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> neurodegenerative changes in diabetic patients prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> development, raising the prospect that non-central vision may also be compromised by primary neural damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that type 2 diabetic patients with DPN exhibit visual sensitivity loss in a distinctive pattern across the visual field, compared with a control group of type 2 diabetic patients without DPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Increment light sensitivity was measured by standard perimetry in the central 30° of visual field for two age-matched groups of type 2 diabetic patients, with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (n = 40/30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> status was assigned using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> disability score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean visual sensitivity values were calculated globally, for each quadrant and for three eccentricities (0-10°, 11-20° and 21-30°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed using a generalised additive mixed model (GAMM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Global and quadrant between-group visual sensitivity mean differences were marginally but consistently lower (by about 1 dB) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> cohort compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between-group mean differences increased from 0.36 to 1.81 dB with increasing eccentricity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GAMM analysis, after adjustment for age, showed these differences to be significant beyond 15° eccentricity and monotonically increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> levels and disease duration were not significant factors within the model (p = 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Visual sensitivity reduces disproportionately with increasing eccentricity in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This sensitivity reduction within the central 30° of visual field may be indicative of more consequential loss in the far periphery </plain></SENT>
