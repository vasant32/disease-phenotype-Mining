<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (n = 265) were enrolled in a prospective 3-year cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular mortality rate was 8.7% (23 of 265) during the 36-month study and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality rate was 9.5% (25 of 265) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (odds ratio [OR] 2.09), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 7.99), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (OR 4.86), internal CS (OR 262.17), and Gensini score (OR 1.15) were independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean ABI value (OR 0.15) was the only predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in this population </plain></SENT>
