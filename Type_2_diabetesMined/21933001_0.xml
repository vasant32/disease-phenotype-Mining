<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) accounts for the majority of diagnosed cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of these individuals are also morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and choose to undergo bariatric surgery to lose weight and gain glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been shown to resolve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several studies suggest that the vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), a newer bariatric operation, may result in comparable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and rapid <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 262 patients diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who underwent either the RYGB or the VSG between 2002 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medication usage before and after surgery was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who discontinued <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medications postoperatively were considered "resolved" of T2D, and those who reduced the number of medications were considered as "showing improvement" in their T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peri- and postoperative complications were also recorded for each operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 8 weeks postoperatively, follow-up data were available for 38 RYGB patients and 71 VSG patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately 79% of RYGB patients and 83% of VSG patients remained off their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VSG patients experienced a significantly lower incidence of major and minor complications both peri- and postoperatively compared with RYGB patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both operations appear to equally resolve T2D in an <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, adult population; however, the incidence of both major and minor complications is much lower in the VSG patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the VSG should also be considered as a treatment option for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with T2D </plain></SENT>
