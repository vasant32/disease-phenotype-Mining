<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Observational studies in the elderly have shown that some of the classical cardiovascular (CV) risk factors are difficult to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study investigated whether increased aortic stiffness is associated with higher mortality risk in both the diabetic and non-diabetic elderly before and after adjusting for geriatric confounders such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, orosomucoid levels, leukocyte count) and denutrition parameters (body weight, body mass index [BMI], plasma albumin and prealbumin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cohort of 324 (84 men) hospitalized elderly subjects, including 255 non-diabetic and 69 diabetic subjects, aortic stiffness was assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) together with CV risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were studied over a 2-year mean follow-up period, thus enabling evaluation of long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 105 subjects died during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significantly higher mortality in the diabetics (P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox analyses differed for non-diabetic subjects and diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the former, the hazard ratio (HR) for an increase of 1 SD (with confidence intervals) was 1.36 (1.07-1.72) for PWV, 0.73 (0.52-1.01) for plasma albumin and 0.63 (0.45-0.89) for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, the HR was 1.60 (1.02-2.50) for leukocyte count, 1.75 (1.03-2.96) for orosomucoid levels and 0.32 (0.15-0.68) for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this very elderly population, although marginally significant on crude analysis, PWV, but not systolic or pulse pressure, was a powerful determinant of total mortality after taking into account the important role of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In diabetics, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and denutrition predominated over mechanical factors </plain></SENT>
