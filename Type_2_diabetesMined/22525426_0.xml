<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> as an independent participant in the atherogenic process has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we tested the effect of insulin and the insulin sensitizer, adiponectin, on human macrophage foam cell formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that both insulin and adiponectin increased the expression of the type 2 scavenger receptor CD36 by approximately twofold and decreased the expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 by &gt;80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases regulation was post-transcriptional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of these changes, we found that oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (oxLDL) uptake was increased by 80% and cholesterol efflux to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1 (apoA1) was decreased by âˆ¼25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This led to two- to threefold more cholesterol accumulation over a 16-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As reported previously in studies of murine systems, scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) expression on human macrophages was downregulated by insulin and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin and adiponectin did not affect oxLDL-induced secretion of monocyte attractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> could promote macrophage foam cell formation and thus may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
