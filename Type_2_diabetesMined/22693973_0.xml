<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean BMI of diabetic subjects was significantly higher than of controls and subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared to the control group, the mean AUCinsulin levels were significantly lower in diabetic subjects (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To observe the correlation between HOMAIR and KITT values, a statistically significant correlation was found (p&lt;0.05, r: 0.222) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the first degree relatives of Type 2 diabetic patients constitute a high risk group for DM, IGT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by using four different tests in Turkish population.The significant finding(s) of the study: We demonstrated a high prevalence of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolism disorders</z:e> in the relatives of type 2 diabetic patients.This study adds our knowledge; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and decreased beta cell reserve occur before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> begin in relatives (Tab </plain></SENT>
