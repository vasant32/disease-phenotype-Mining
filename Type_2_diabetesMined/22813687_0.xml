<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a major contributor to disease burden globally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of systematic reviews support the efficacy of lifestyle interventions in preventing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults; however, relatively little attention has been paid to the generalizability of study findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study systematically reviews the reporting of external validity components and generalizability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Lifestyle intervention studies for the prevention of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults with at least 6 months' follow-up, published between 1990 and 2011, were identified through searches of major electronic databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>External validity reporting was rated using an assessment tool, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analysis was undertaken in 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 31 primary studies (n=95 papers) met the selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies lacked full reporting on external validity elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Description of the study sample, intervention, delivery agents, and participant attrition rates were reported by most studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, few studies reported on the representativeness of individuals and settings, methods for recruiting settings and delivery agents, costs, and how interventions could be institutionalized into routine service delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is uncertain to what extent the findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention studies apply to men, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, those living in rural and remote communities, and to low- and middle-income countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of external validity components in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention studies needs to be enhanced to improve the evidence base for the translation and dissemination of these programs into policy and practice </plain></SENT>
