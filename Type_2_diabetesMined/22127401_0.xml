<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined serum cystatin C and adiponectin levels in 234 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who visited our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum level of cystatin C was positively correlated with age (P &lt; 0.001), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.013), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001), and adiponectin (p = 0.001), while it was inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum adiponectin was significantly higher in patients with high serum cystatin C levels than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cystatin C levels (8.3 ± 4.7 and 6.2 ± 3.2 μg/mL, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was also significantly higher in male patients with high cystatin C levels, but not in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, serum adiponectin was also independently and significantly correlated to age, diastolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and serum cystatin C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum adiponectin level was correlated with serum cystatin C level on simple and multiple regression analyses in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although circulating adiponectin is increased in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e>, it might be biologically inactive due to binding to cystatin C and thus not display an anti-arteriosclerotic effect </plain></SENT>
