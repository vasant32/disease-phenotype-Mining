<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the effects of glycemic control on platelet reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation and flow cytometric expression of P-selectin in 90 patients (56 diabetic and 34 nondiabetic patients) undergoing coronary stent implantation after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> as a potential predictor of poststent complications and its relation to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment platelet reactivity was significantly elevated in diabetic compared with nondiabetic participants and was associated with smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, overweight, and cardiovascular ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A linear relationship was found between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c in diabetic patients and platelet reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both methods (standard aggregometry and P-selectin expression) used for assessment of platelet function were positively correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> detected by posttreatment platelet reactivity is a risk factor for ischemic events after PCI in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
