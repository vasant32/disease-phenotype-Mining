<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The damaged endothelium is repaired by resident cells also through the contribution of a population of circulating cells derived from bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells, termed endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in maintaining endothelial homeostasis and contributes to the formation of new blood vessels with a process called postnatal vasculogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms whereby these cells allow for protection of the cardiovascular system are still unclear; nevertheless, consistent evidences have shown that impairment and reduction of EPCs are hallmark features of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, EPC alterations might have a pathogenic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, thus becoming a potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, EPC alterations will be examined in the context of macrovascular and microvascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, highlighting their roles and functions in the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
