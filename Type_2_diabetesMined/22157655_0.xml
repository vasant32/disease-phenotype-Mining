<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we studied whether glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 patients is related to renal structural changes and predicts the functional development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty normo- or microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients having a renal biopsy were followed every 6 months for a mean of 6.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the time of biopsy, determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31709">iohexol</z:chebi> clearance, correlated with filtration surface per glomerulus, but no other quantitative microscopic morphometric parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The filtration surface was positively associated with the decrease in GFR during the first year but not associated in subsequent years following the renal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GFR showed a statistically significant linear decrease in 9 of the 30 patients; however, slopes of the regression lines were almost zero in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GFR increased and decreased in a parabolic manner in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of the nine patients with a statistically significant decline in renal function did not show any appreciable worsening of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, while two patients developed persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in renal biopsy-proven normo- or microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, glomerular hyperfiltration is closely associated with an increased glomerular filtration surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An elevated GFR predicts its subsequent decline, which may occur without worsening of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
