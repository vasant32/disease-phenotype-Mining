<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In current research, the therapeutic effects of ZQR on type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and the underlying molecular mechanisms were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animal model with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was developed by high fat/<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> diet feeding plus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> injection for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diabetic rats were then orally administered with ZQR extract at the dose of 4 g/kg, 8 g/kg body weight/day for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and total cholesterol in untreated diabetic rats were significantly higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ZQR treatment not only reduced serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level in diabetic rats, but also decreased serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and total cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin excretion rate, serum <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> were significantly decreased in ZQR groups compared with untreated diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological study of kidney samples showed that extracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0011353'>mesangial matrix expansion</z:mp> in diabetic rats was suppressed by ZQR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element binding-protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and its target genes including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in renal cortex were significantly decreased in ZQR treated rats compared to untreated diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, renal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> was significantly reduced in ZQR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ZQR significantly inhibited the overexpression of transforming growth factor-Î²1 and fibronectin in the renal cortex of diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral treatment of ZQR improved diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> by inhibiting the overexpression of SREBP-1c and its target genes including ACC and FAS in experimental type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
