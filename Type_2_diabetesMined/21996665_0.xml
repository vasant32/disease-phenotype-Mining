<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Self-reported sleep &lt;6 h/day is associated with increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which may be mediated in part by sleep-loss-related reduction in physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between habitual sleep curtailment and physical activity in adults with parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight young urban adults with parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (27 F/21 M; mean (s.d.) age 26 (4) years; BMI 23.8 (2.5) kg/m(2)) each completed 13 (2) days of sleep and physical activity monitoring by wrist actigraphy and waist accelerometry while following their usual lifestyle at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory polysomnography was used to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome of the study was the comparison of total daily activity counts between participants with habitual sleep &lt;6 vs. ≥6 h/night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary measures included daily time spent sedentary and in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751509" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Short sleepers</z:e> had no sleep abnormalities and showed signs of increased sleep pressure consistent with a behavioral pattern of habitual sleep curtailment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to participants who slept ≥6 h/night, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751509" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">short sleepers</z:e> had 27% fewer daily activity counts (P = 0.042), spent less time in moderate-plus-vigorous physical activity (-43 min/day; P = 0.010), and remained more sedentary (+69 min/day; P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that young urban adults with parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who habitually curtail their sleep have less daily physical activity and more sedentary living, which may enhance their metabolic risk </plain></SENT>
