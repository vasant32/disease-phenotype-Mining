<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focusing on patients with SCS associated to AI, while there is convincing evidence in the literature that even a mild hyper cortisolemia is associated with alterations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, evidence is insufficient to conclude that the simple correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, even mild, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>hypercortisolism</z:hpo> can completely revert metabolic, mainly glycemic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, considering the variability of the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's syndrome</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 reported in the literature, no agreement does exist whether screening for CS can be useful and recommended in those patients </plain></SENT>
