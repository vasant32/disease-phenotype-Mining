<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the regulations of adipokine secretion is important because adipokines are implicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e>, such as, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the regulatory roles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>) on the secretion of apelin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and distinct signaling pathways mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> receptor type 1 (AT₁) and type 2 (AT₂) were revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that activation of AT₁ receptors stimulates apelin secretion in Ca²⁺, protein kinase C, and MAPK kinase dependent ways while activation of AT₂ receptors inhibits apelin secretion through cAMP and cGMP dependent pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of apelin receptor (APJ) is also similarly regulated by AT₁ and AT₂ receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, a detailed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> signaling map is proposed </plain></SENT>
