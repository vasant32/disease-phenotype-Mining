<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to define the contribution of KCNJ11 to new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after transplantation (NODAT) among patients treated with Tacrolimus (Tac) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 115 NODAT and 205 non-NODAT were genotyped for rs5219 (p.E23K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AA+AG genotypes were significantly associated with NODAT-risk (p=0.004; OR=2.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reported effect of this KCNJ11 polymorphism on insulin release by beta cells could explain this association </plain></SENT>
