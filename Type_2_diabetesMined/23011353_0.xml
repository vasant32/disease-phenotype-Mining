<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, inability of the beta cells to compensate for the increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> represents a key defect leading to overt type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to replicate the association between genetic variants of the PCSK2 gene and insulin secretion, and to explore the effect on risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Replication of PCSK2 variants against insulin secretion included 7,682 non-diabetic Scandinavian individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was measured as the corrected insulin response or disposition index, i.e. insulin secretion adjusted for the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was studied in 28,287 Scandinavian individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The C-allele of PCSK2 rs2208203 was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> measured as the corrected insulin response (n = 8,151; β = -0.112, p = 1.3 × 10(-6)) as well as disposition index (n = 8,078, β = -0.128, p = 1.6 × 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The variant was also associated with lower fasting glucagon levels (β = -0.084, p = 0.005) in non-diabetic individuals with a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of over 5.5 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In human pancreatic islets, PCSK2 expression correlated negatively with HbA(1c) (n = 133, r = -0.196, p = 0.038), and showed a tendency to be lower in hyperglycaemic (HbA(1c) ≥6.0% or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; n = 47, p = 0.13) than normoglycaemic (HbA(1c) &gt;6.0%; n = 66) donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of the PCSK2 rs2208203 risk allele did not influence gene expression, nor did it show an apparent risk in terms of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A variant of the PCSK2 gene was associated with reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, but also with lower glucagon levels, which could potentially counteract the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> on the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
