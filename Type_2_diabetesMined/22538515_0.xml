<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (16 male, 16 female), and 32 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy individuals (16 male, 16 female) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, the ventilatory threshold (VT) and peak Vo(2) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On a separate day, subjects completed four 6-min bouts of constant-load cycling at 80% VT for the determination of Vo(2) kinetics using standard procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output (CO) (inert gas rebreathing) was recorded at rest, 30, and 240 s during two additional bouts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak Vo(2) (ml·kg(-1)·min(-1)) was significantly reduced in men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with their respective nondiabetic counterparts (men, 27.8 ± 4.4 vs. 31.1 ± 6.2 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1); women, 19.4 ± 4.1 vs. 21.4 ± 2.9 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time constant (s) of phase 2 (τ(2)) and mean response time (s) of the Vo(2) response (MRT) were slowed in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with healthy women (τ(2), 43.3 ± 9.8 vs. 33.6 ± 10.0 s; MRT, 51.7 ± 9.4 vs. 43.5 ± 11.4s) and in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with nondiabetic men (τ(2), 43.8 ± 12.0 vs. 35.3 ± 9.5 s; MRT, 57.6 ± 8.3 vs. 47.3 ± 9.3 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of these impairments was not different between males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The steady-state CO responses or the dynamic responses of CO were not affected by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among men or women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced impairments in peak Vo(2) and Vo(2) kinetics are not affected by sex in middle aged participants </plain></SENT>
