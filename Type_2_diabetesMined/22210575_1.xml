<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the effectiveness of SU treatment in ABCC8-NDM patients, we further characterized <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> ABCC8-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven adult subjects from three NDM families and one family with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were assessed using clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We screened 139 type 2 diabetic patients who were well controlled by SU for ABCC8 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ABCC8 mutation carriers exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, frank <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or insulin-requiring <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) improved in five SU-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion capacity was impaired in three patients compared with adult control subjects but was restored after a 4-week SU trial in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cohort screening revealed four SU-treated patients with ABCC8 mutations, two of which are likely causal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although of rare occurrence, recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> ABCC8-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may help in targeting patients for SU therapy </plain></SENT>
