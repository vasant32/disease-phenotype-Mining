<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A higher increase in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> exchanger (NHE) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has been reported in type 2 diabetic mouse hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of NHE in inducing changes in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and alterations in ventricular function during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion in type 2 diabetic mouse hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hearts from male type 2 diabetic db/db (12-15 weeks old) and age-matched control db/+ mice were subjected to Langendorff perfusion and loaded with 4 Î¼M of the Ca(2+) indicator fura-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hearts were exposed to no-flow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 15 minutes and then reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[Ca(2+)](i) was measured by monitoring fura-2 fluorescence at 500 nm (excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm), while left ventricular (LV) pressure was simultaneously measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: db/db hearts exhibited a lower recovery of LV developed pressure than db/+ hearts during reperfusion following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) was increased to a greater level in diabetic hearts than in the control hearts during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) overload during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion in diabetic hearts was markedly reduced in the presence of the NHE inhibitor cariporide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a significantly improved recovery of ventricular function on reperfusion, as shown by a lower increase in diastolic pressure and increased recovery of developed pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NHE plays a key role in enhancing cytoplasmic Ca(2+) overload during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion and severely impairing post-ischemic cardiac function in hearts from type 2 diabetic db/db mice </plain></SENT>
