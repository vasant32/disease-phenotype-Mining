<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of this benefit, insulin is often delayed until late in the course of disease partly because of its perceived negative impact on quality of life (QOL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to examine the effect of early implementation of short-term IIT on patient-reported QOL and treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 34 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (5.9 Â± 6.6 years duration, on zero to two oral antihyperglycaemic agents) underwent 4-8 weeks of IIT consisting of basal detemir and pre-meal insulin aspart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported QOL, treatment satisfaction and symptom distress were assessed at baseline and post-IIT using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Quality of Life Measure (DQOL), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Symptoms Checklist-Revised (DSC-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> post-IIT (mean 6.5% vs. 7%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 34 patients tolerated IIT well with no severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following IIT, the SF-36 showed a significant improvement compared to baseline in reported physical functioning (mean 88.2 vs. 83.3, P = 0.009), general health (69.4 vs. 65.6, P = 0.03), and general mental health (85.2 vs. 82.2, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DQOL demonstrated a significant improvement in global health perception (P = 0.02), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worry (P = 0.006) and treatment satisfaction (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DSC-R revealed a significant improvement in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related total symptom score (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to popular perception, a short course of IIT resulted in significant improvements in QOL and treatment satisfaction, demonstrating the patient acceptability of early insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
