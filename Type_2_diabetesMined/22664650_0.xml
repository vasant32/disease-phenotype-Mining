<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: A clinic-based, prospective study of type 2 diabetic patients was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 73 subjects were enrolled in this study after cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and ankle-brachial index measurements to exclude patients with ischemic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaque formation in the carotid artery was measured on ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating EPCs (CD34(+)/CD133(+)/CD309(+) cells) were counted on flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to subjects without carotid artery plaques, patients with plaques were significantly older (P=0.006) and had decreased EPC count (P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum glycated albumin (GA) level and the GA/glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> ratio tended to decrease in patients with plaques (P=0.091 and 0.067, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors were not significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On binary logistic regression analysis old age, low EPC count, and high serum GA level were independently correlated with carotid artery plaque formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: EPC count and serum GA level appear to be a protective and an aggravating factor for endothelial damage, respectively, and therefore, a reduced EPC count or an increased GA level results in atherosclerotic plaque formation in type 2 diabetic patients.  (Circ J 2012; 76: 2273-2279) </plain></SENT>
