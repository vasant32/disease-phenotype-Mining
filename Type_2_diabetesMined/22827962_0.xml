<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although telomere shortening has been linked with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and most variables of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, a shortcoming of such studies is the measurement of telomere length in leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we tested the association among adipocyte cell size, telomere length (both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue) and systemic levels of adiponectin in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects and patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue were obtained from the subjects who undergone bariatric surgery or other abdominal surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study groups comprised of: i) Control subjects, ii) Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> patients, iii) <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and iv) <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte cell size was measured by histological staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was determined by Real-Time PCR and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation was assessed by fluorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to control subjects, adipocyte size (both subcutaneous and visceral) from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, diabetic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>-diabetic subjects was significantly larger [p&lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals with adipose <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> also exhibited shortened telomeres and hypoadiponectinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlation analysis revealed that both visceral and subcutaneous fat cell size showed a positive correlation with FBS, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis revealed that the association between shortened telomeres and hypoadiponectinemia was lost when adjusted for adipocyte cell size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0006094'>Adipocyte hypertrophy</z:mp> appears to be strongly associated with shortened telomeres, hypoadiponectinemia and poor glycemic and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these molecular alterations seen in lean diabetics reflect a state of 'metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>' </plain></SENT>
