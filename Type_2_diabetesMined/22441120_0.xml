<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ghrelin, a novel endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, is considered to implicate the development of the type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Leu72Met (+408C&gt;A) polymorphism of the preproghrelin, has been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of ghrelin gene Leu72Met polymorphism and its association with the type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-control study on 877 patients with T2DM and 864 controls, which were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and DNA sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory analyses were carried out in the hospital laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference in the Leu72Met genotype distributions and allele frequency was observed between type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and controls (both P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism was not associated with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, among the T2DM group, the patients carrying Leu72Leu genotype had significantly increased levels of FPG and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> compared with variant genotypes (Leu72Met and Met72Met) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the subjects with variant genotypes had significantly increased levels of FINS, HOMA-IR compared with Leu72Leu genotype (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Leu72Met polymorphism of the preproghrelin gene was not associated with T2DM in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it may have some roles in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
