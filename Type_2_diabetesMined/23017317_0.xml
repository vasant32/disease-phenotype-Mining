<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: While the protective nature of moderate alcohol consumption against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is well known, inconsistent findings continue to be reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility of different mixes of effect modifiers has been raised as a reason for those inconsistent findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aim was to examine potential effect modifiers that can change the effect of alcohol consumption on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From data in the third Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 3,982 individuals over the age of 30 years who had not been diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were selected for inclusion in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Breslow and Day's test and the Wald test between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and alcohol consumption in a multiple logistic regression model were used to assess effect modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Odds ratios for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> stratified by alcohol consumption strata and assessed using Breslow and Day's tests for homogeneity indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> was not a significant confounding factor (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the Wald test for interaction terms, which is a conservative method of effect modification, was significant (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that moderate alcohol consumption is not necessarily protective for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, if a person has <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>People who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> should be aware of the risk associated with alcohol consumption, a risk that contrasts with the reported protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
