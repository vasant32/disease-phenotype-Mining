<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to find anti-diabetic agents, we report herein on the isolation, structural elucidation and bioactivity of nine friedelane-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35191">triterpenes</z:chebi> (1-9) and twenty two known ones (10-31) from the root barks of Celastrus vulcanicola and Maytenus jelskii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two compounds from this series (1 and 3) exhibited increased insulin-mediated signalling, which suggests these friedelane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35191">triterpenes</z:chebi> have potential therapeutic use in insulin resistant states </plain></SENT>
