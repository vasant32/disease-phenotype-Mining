<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted during 100% oxygen inhalation in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with either no diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (n = 12) or mild to moderate background diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (n = 12), as well as in healthy control subjects (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, changes in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> oxygenation response were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the healthy control group, levels of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> oxygenation response increased slowly during 100% oxygen inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, they increased more quickly and attained homeostasis much earlier in the groups with background diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (at the 20-min time point) and with no diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (at the 25-min time point) than in the healthy control group (at the 42-min time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, levels of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> oxygenation response in the group with background diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> increased more than that of the group with no diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, which in turn increased more than that of the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are statistically significant differences between the group with background diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and the healthy control group at 6-, 8-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 25-min time points (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of the healthy control group by setting fundus photography results as 'gold standard' in our research, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and receiver operating characteristic area for reporting the early indications of utility of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were 83.33%, 58.33%, 50%, 87.5% and 0.774, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that magnetic resonance imaging is a potential screening method and probably a quantitative physiological biomarker to find early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
