<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus saxagliptin fixed-dose combination is now proposed to clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, saxagliptin's license was recently extended to include diabetic patients with moderate or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (RI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is still contraindicated in patients with RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: This review analyses the pro and contra of using a combination of saxagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (separately or as a fixed-dose combination) in type 2 diabetic patients with moderate or severe RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An extensive literature search of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pharmacokinetic data and efficacy/safety profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and saxagliptin in subjects with RI was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Since both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and saxagliptin are excreted via the kidney, dose adjustment is required in case of moderate-to-severe RI (half dose of saxagliptin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, major discrepancies exist between guidelines (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> excluded in case of RI because of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo>) and real life (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> widely prescribed in patients with some degree of RI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physicians should weigh the benefit/risk ratio carefully before deciding to prescribe or withdraw the combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus saxagliptin in patients with stable RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A redefinition of contraindications to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> will enable more physicians to prescribe within guidelines and to administer saxagliptin combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in more patients who clearly may benefit from this combination </plain></SENT>
