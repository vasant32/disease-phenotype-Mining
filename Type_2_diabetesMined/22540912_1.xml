<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth, there are few data to guide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficacy of three treatment regimens to achieve durable glycemic control in children and adolescents with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients 10 to 17 years of age were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily) to attain a glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of less than 8% and were randomly assigned to continued treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone or to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (4 mg twice a day) or a lifestyle-intervention program focusing on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> through eating and activity behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was loss of glycemic control, defined as a glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of at least 8% for 6 months or sustained metabolic decompensation requiring insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 699 randomly assigned participants (mean duration of diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 7.8 months), 319 (45.6%) reached the primary outcome over an average follow-up of 3.86 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of failure were 51.7% (120 of 232 participants), 38.6% (90 of 233), and 46.6% (109 of 234) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus lifestyle intervention, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone (P=0.006); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus lifestyle intervention was intermediate but not significantly different from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prespecified analyses according to sex and race or ethnic group showed differences in sustained effectiveness, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone least effective in non-Hispanic black participants and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> most effective in girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events were reported in 19.2% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was associated with durable glycemic control in approximately half of children and adolescents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, but not an intensive lifestyle intervention, was superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
