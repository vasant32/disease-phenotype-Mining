<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> reduction and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
