<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the functional relevance for genetic variants at this locus is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is critical to systematically assess the relationship of genetic variants in this region with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A fine-mapping study was conducted by genotyping fourteen tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 290-kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) region using a two-stage case-control study of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suggestive associations (P&lt;0.05) observed from 1,200 cases and 1,200 controls in the first stage were further replicated in 1,725 cases and 2,081 controls in the second stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven tagging SNPs were consistently associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both stages (P&lt;0.05), with combined odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.14 to 1.33 in the combined analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant locus was rs7923837 [OR = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.47] at the 3'-flanking region of HHEX gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNP rs1111875 was found to be another partially independent locus (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.13-1.35) in this region that was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cumulative effect of rs7923837 and rs1111875 was observed with individuals carrying 1, 2, and 3 or 4 risk alleles having a 1.27, 1.44, and 1.73-fold increased risk, respectively, for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P for trend = 4.1E-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results confirm that genetic variants of the IDE-KIF11-HHEX region at 10q23.33 contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility and suggest that rs7923837 may represent the strongest signal related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
