<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and low prostate-specific antigen levels for uncertain reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, two studies demonstrated the time course of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with prostate-specific antigen levels, which would be explained by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> renal complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to determine whether diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> is associated with prostate-specific antigen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eligible patients were men aged ≥40 years, with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a recorded prostate-specific antigen level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> or prostatectomy or prostate-specific antigen level ≥10 ng/mL and patients with end-organ damage were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 247 patients included in the adjusted analysis, 51 (20.8 %) were diagnosed with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> with log-transformed prostate-specific antigen level was detected (Spearman's correlation coefficient -0.201, p = 0.003; adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other correlated variables) and fit into a linear regression model (B-coefficient -0.331, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> group with non-diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> group, the difference in log-transformed prostate-specific antigen levels was also significant (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicated that patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> have low prostate-specific antigen levels, suggesting fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> being detected or fewer incidences among this group </plain></SENT>
