<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Compound K (CK) is a final intestinal metabolite of protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides (PDG) from Panax ginseng </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although anti-diabetic activity of CK have been reported with genetic mouse models (db/db mice) in recent years, the therapeutic usefulness of CK and PDG in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a more prevalent form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, we developed a mouse of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100651'>insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> that closely simulated the <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> of the human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was induced in male ICR mice by combining of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The male ICR mice fed with HFD for 4 weeks received 100mg/kg of STZ injected intraperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, mice with fasting (12h) blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (FBG) above 7.8 mmol/L were divided into 3 groups (n=12) and treated with vehicle (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model, DM), 300 mg/kg/day of PDG and 30 mg/kg/day of CK for 4 weeks while continuing on the high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycemic effects of CK and PDG were consistently demonstrated by FBG levels, and insulin-sensitizing effects were seen during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the mechanism of hypoglycemic effect in type 2 diabetic mice was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gluconeogenic genes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">Phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase (PEPCK) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), were decreased in two treatment groups with CK showing greater effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrated the hypoglycemic and insulin-sensitizing capabilities of CK on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induced by HFD/STZ via down-regulation of PEPCK and G6Pase expression in liver </plain></SENT>
