<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects were patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were normotensive based on blood pressure (BP) measurement in the clinic (n = 80) without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, macroalbuminuria, overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), measurement of flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of ABPM, subjects with mean daytime systolic BP ≥135 and/or 85 mm Hg were defined as MHT and their clinical data were compared with those of normotensive patients (NT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were also compared with those of type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT) as measured in the clinic (n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MHT was detected in 47.5% of the study subjects with normotension at clinic (n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Impaired FMD (5.65 ± 2.00% for NT, 4.26 ± 1.88% for MHT, 3.90 ± 1.71% for HT, P &lt; 0.001) and higher baPWV (1,514.2 ± 212.7 cm/s for NT, 1,749.9 ± 339.7 cm/s for MHT, and 1,768.6 ± 302.8 cm/s for HT, P &lt; 0.001) were similarly noted in patients with MHT and HT compared with NT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis indicated that daytime systolic BP measured by ABPM, the estimated duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were significantly associated with FMD and daytime systolic BP measured by ABPM, not systolic BP at clinic, age, and HbA(1c) were significantly associated with baPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given that patients with impaired FMD and higher baPWV are known to be at higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, our data suggest that type 2 diabetic patients with MHT could be also at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
