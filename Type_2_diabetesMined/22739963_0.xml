<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> are usually treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prolonged pharmacokinetic insulin profile in patients with delayed renal insulin elimination impairs a successful therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to its hepatic metabolism, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> is a potential candidate for additional administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> versus placebo on total daily insulin requirements and several pleiotropic factors in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients requiring hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30 mg) versus placebo was explored in this prospective, randomized, double-blind parallel multicenter phase II study analyzing data from 36 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> currently under hemodialysis (25 male, 11 female, aged 69.2 ± 7.9 years, baseline HbA1c 7.6 ± 0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most important efficacy parameters collected before dialysis and after an overnight fast at baseline and after 6 months were: total daily insulin dose, HbA1c, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, adiponectin, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, NT-proBNP, and ultrafiltrate volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> resulted in a significant decrease of the daily insulin dose by 35% versus baseline (placebo: -10%, n.s.), improvement in HbA1c (-0.60 ± 0.87%, p = 0.015; placebo: 0.21 ± 1.1%, n.s.) and adiponectin (7.33 ± 4.80 mg/l, p &lt; 0.001; placebo: -1.37 ± 2.56 mg/l, n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Slight improvements or no changes were seen with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and NT-proBNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no indication of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> risk and volume overload by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> to insulin in patients with late-stage <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> requiring hemodialysis is a well-tolerated treatment option that improves glycemic control with simultaneous insulin-sparing potential </plain></SENT>
