<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remained uncertain whether such liraglutide-induced improvement is maintained after discharge from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the long-term effects of liraglutide on body weight, glycemic control, and eating behavior in Japanese <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were hospitalized at Osaka University Hospital between November 2010 and December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) were examined on admission, at discharge and at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the liraglutide group (BMI; 31.3 ± 5.3 kg/m2, n = 29), patients were introduced to liraglutide after correction of hyperglycemic by insulin or oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs and maintained on liraglutide after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eating behavior was assessed in patients treated with liraglutide using The Guideline For <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> questionnaire issued by the Japan Society for the Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, at admission, discharge, 3 and 6 months after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the insulin group (BMI; 29.1 ± 3.0 kg/m2, n = 28), each patient was treated with insulin during hospitalization and glycemic control maintained by insulin after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Liraglutide induced significant and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> from admission up to 6 months after discharge, while no change in body weight after discharge was noted in the insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide produced significant improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major scores of eating behavior questionnaire items and such effect was maintained at 6 months after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> correlated significantly with the decrease in scores for recognition of weight and constitution, sense of hunger, and eating style </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Liraglutide produced meaningful long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and significantly improved eating behavior in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
