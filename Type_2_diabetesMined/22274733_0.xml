<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the antilipidemic and anti-inflammatory effect of S. anacardium Linn. nut milk extract (SA) in Type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced in rats by feeding them with a high fat diet followed by i.p. of 35 mg/kg body weight of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic rats were treated with the drugs, SA (200 mg/kg body weight) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (500 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antilipidemic effect of the drug was established by studying the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> alterations and also the alterations in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolizing enzymes in the experimental group of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of the drug on the expression of PPAR γ was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine the anti-inflammatory effect of the drug, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6 and also C-reactive protein were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Semecarpus anacardium nut milk extract at a dosage of 200 mg/kg orally significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced and normalized the alterations in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in diabetic rats effectively than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SA treatment significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of PPAR γ, thereby establishing the antilipidemic effect of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in the levels of inflammatory cytokines were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) brought down to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels on treatment with the drug SA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study thereby establishes the antilipidemic and anti-inflammatory effect of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, by decreasing the alterations in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and inflammatory status, the drug can effectively improve the insulin sensitivity in rats and can serve as an excellent drug in the treatment of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
