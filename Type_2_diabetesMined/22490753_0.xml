<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study in type 2 diabetic patients was conducted in a community of Shanghai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questionnaire, clinical examination and laboratory tests were completed to collect the information about sociodemographic and healthcare characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1421 eligible patients with complete information were screened from 1487 type 2 diabetic patients between November 2008 and March 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of them, 40.75% were men, 59.25% were women, aged 37 - 86 (61.33 ± 9.65) years old, with diabetic duration of 0.25 - 43.92 (7.85 ± 6.34) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, 43.42% had diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, 21.18% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>; 69.95% met the screening definition for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 76.07% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, 15.55% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> and 23.65% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control rates of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, blood pressure and serum cholesterol were 57.71%, 33.99%, 14.22% and 2.46%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease, diabetic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e> was 41.31%, 18.51% and 13.44%, respectively; and 9.36% were diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> of unknown reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, diabetic duration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and poor control of blood pressure were independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e>; age and poor control of blood pressure were independently associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>; age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> were independent risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the diabetic duration of these subjects is relatively short, the prevalence of complications including diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e> shows the importance of further screening and diagnoses for prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strict control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure, serum cholesterol and serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> are key points of cutting down the prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
