<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the association between ethnicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> prevalence after adjusting for age, sex, Hba1c, total cholesterol, elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and hypertriglyceridemic waist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 354 primary health care patients diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (173 Assyrians/Syrians and 181 Swedes) residing in Sodertalje, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> prevalence was higher among Swedes than Assyrians/Syrians, (77% versus 58%; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the unadjusted logistic regression model, the odds ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in Swedes was twice as high than that in Assyrians/Syrians (OR = 2.44; 95% CI =1.54 - 3.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the age- and sex-adjusted model, odds ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was 2.25 (95% CI 1.41-3.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for total cholesterol was made, the odds ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> decreased slightly to 1.73 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and hypertriglyceridemic waist were separately introduced, the odds ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was no longer significant between the ethnic groups (1.60 and 1.43 for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and hypertriglyceridemic waist respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, advanced age - 60-69 years old (OR = 1.80, CI 95% 1.00-3.20) and [greater than or equal to] 70 years old (OR = 2.88, CI 95% 1.40-5.93), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>elevated total cholesterol</z:hpo> (OR = 1.48, CI 95% 1.12-1.95) and presents of hypertriglyceridemic waist (those with high WC and high TG) were significant confounding factors for the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> independent of ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The crude differences in prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> between the Swedes and Assyrians/Syrians in our study population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were no longer significant when adjusting for high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> levels or the presence of hypertriglyceridemic waist </plain></SENT>
