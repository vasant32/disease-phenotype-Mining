<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of different technical solutions one can propose different potential limitations in daily practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So we tried to identify the accuracy of two different devices head to head in daily routine to point out individual characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 24 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> to wear the GlucoDay and the MiniMed continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement system at the same time for 48Â h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the mean differences in simultaneous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements, the confidence intervals were calculated by standard methods based on the t-distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of both continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement systems showed that there was a tendency for higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels measured by the GlucoDay device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences were dependent on the time of the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absolute difference between two consecutive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements was higher for the GlucoDay system what means a somehow higher fluctuation of the GlucoDay measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The differences in intraindividual comparison of the GlucoDay and the MiniMed continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement systems in type 2 diabetic patients may be taken into account when using different systems for detection of nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and the observation of trends used for therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
