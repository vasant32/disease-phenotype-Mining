<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, effective glycemic control not only reduces the incidence of microvascular complications but also corrects the <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> that contribute to the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Progressive β-cell failure and multiple side effects, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, associated with many current therapies present obstacles to the achievement of optimal and durable glycemic control in subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most recently, inhibitors of the renal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter have been developed to reduce the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration by producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the mechanism of action of these oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents is independent of β-cell function and tissue sensitivity to insulin, they improve glycemic control while avoiding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we summarize the available data concerning the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety of this novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> class of therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
