<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample consisted of 144 free-living patients (84 women and 60 men) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 60 to 84 y old and 209 age-matched controls (116 women and 93 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements (weight; height; upper arm, hip, waist, and calf circumferences; biceps; triceps; and subscapular and suprailiac skinfolds) were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for the assessment of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BMI, upper arm muscular area, and waist-to-hip ratio were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis was performed in the entire diabetic sample and the healthy BMI-matched groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with healthy subjects, patients had greater weight (P &lt; 0.01 in women), higher BMI (P &lt; 0.01 in women), smaller muscular area (P &lt; 0.01 in men), and thicker skinfolds (P &lt; 0.01 in women and men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female and male patients showed larger phase angles (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, female patients showed a shorter vector length and lower resistance (P &lt; 0.01) and male patients showed a higher reactance (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BMI-matched analysis confirmed that patients were characterized by larger phase angles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were characterized by peculiar anthropometric and bioelectrical patterns, which can be related to their smaller appendicular muscular area and lower extracellular/intracellular water ratio </plain></SENT>
