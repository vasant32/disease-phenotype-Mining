<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to investigate the association between meat consumption and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the EPIC-InterAct study, a large prospective case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 11.7 years of follow-up, 12,403 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified among 340,234 adults from eight European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A centre-stratified random subsample of 16,835 individuals was selected in order to perform a case-cohort design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prentice-weighted Cox regression analyses were used to estimate HR and 95% CI for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to meat consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, multivariate analyses showed significant positive associations with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for increasing consumption of total meat (50 g increments: HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.05, 1.12), red meat (HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03, 1.13) and processed meat (HR 1.12; 95% CI 1.05, 1.19), and a borderline positive association with meat iron intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effect modifications by sex and class of BMI were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In men, the results of the overall analyses were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, the association with total and red meat persisted, although attenuated, while an association with poultry consumption also emerged (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07, 1.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These associations were not evident among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This prospective study confirms a positive association between high consumption of total and red meat and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a large cohort of European adults </plain></SENT>
