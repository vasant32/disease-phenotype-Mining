<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim was to assess the dietary pattern during Ramadan season among type 2 diabetic Muslim subjects who underwent fasting and intensive dietary counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted among 70 Muslim subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who undertook fasting during Ramadan and was part of a randomized control trial using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> published previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were subjected to a dietary assessment and counseling at three stages, i.e., initiation of the study, mid-Ramadan and post-Ramadan, by a trained dietician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary assessment was done by the 24-hour dietary recall method and the food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic diet sheets were dispensed to subjects based on their body mass index (BMI), daily activity, and needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean caloric intake between pre-Ramadan (before fasting) and mid-Ramadan (15 days after fasting) were 1506.80 kcal and 1614.29 (P = 0.001) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of active components pre and during Ramadan were: carbohydrates (g) 260.76 and 265.35 g (P = 0.001), proteins (g) 43.64 and 46.19 (P = 0.001) and fat (g) was 32.88 and 44.16 (P = 0.0001) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of energy from dietary carbohydrate prior to fasting (64.11 ± 6.73) and during fasting (68.41 ± 4.41) remained almost unchanged but statistically significant when compared at different intervals before and during fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fat intake increased significantly during fasting (P = &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The dietary composition in a type 2 diabetic Muslim population who undertook fasting during Ramadan showed a mean increase in consumption of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> components of diet during the period of fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nutritional compliance during such a time seems to be difficult and warrants repeated counseling and regular follow-up to achieve targets </plain></SENT>
