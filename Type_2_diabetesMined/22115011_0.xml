<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> subfractions and ultimately on the atherosclerotic risk profile remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We thus determined the concentration of atherogenic small, dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (sdLDL) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an elevated cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, open-label 6-week study investigating the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> 10mg (E), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20mg (S) and the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi>-/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 10/20mg (C) on the concentration of sdLDL separated from fresh plasma by gradient ultracentrifugation in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (NCT01384058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were screened for sdLDL, 41 were randomized, and 40 patients (12 E, 14 S and 14 C) completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> fell by 14% (p=0.004) and 15% (p=0.006) with E, 22% (p&lt;0.001) and 32% (p&lt;0.001) with S, and 32% (p&lt;0.001) and 44% (p&lt;0.001) with C, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E reduced the concentration of sdLDL by 20% (p=0.043) whereas S and C reduced sdLDL by 24% (p=0.020) and 33% (p=0.003), respectively, and non-sdLDL by 28% (p=0.004) and 42% (p&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the further drop in sdLDL by adding E to S was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">Ezetimibe</z:chebi> alone and in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> reduced the concentration of atherogenic sdLDL in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
