<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although GSIS is driven predominantly by direct sensing of a rise in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by pancreatic Î²-cells, there is growing evidence that hypothalamic neurons control other aspects of peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the role of the brain in the modulation of GSIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the effects of increasing or decreasing hypothalamic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin secretion, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or inhibitors of glucokinase, respectively, were infused into the third ventricle during intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IVGTTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-infused rats displayed improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> handling, particularly within the first few minutes of the IVGTT, with a significantly lower area under the excursion curve within the first 10 min (AUC0-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was explained by <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, infusion of the glucokinase inhibitors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> or mannoheptulose worsened <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and decreased GSIS in the first few minutes of IVGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a role for brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensors in the regulation of GSIS, particularly during the early phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that pharmacological agents targeting hypothalamic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-sensing pathways may represent novel therapeutic strategies for enhancing early phase insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
