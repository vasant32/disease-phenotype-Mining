<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fibrin network forms the backbone of the arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, and fibrin clot structure determines predisposition to cardiovascular events.Objectives:The aim of the study was to investigate fibrin clot structure/fibrinolysis in the largest type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cohort and analyze associations with cardiometabolic risk factors and vascular pathology.Design:Clot structure/fibrinolysis was assessed in 875 participants of the Edinburgh Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study [age, 68 (range, 60-75) yr; 450 males] by turbidimetric assays, and clots were visualized by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four parameters of clot structure/fibrinolysis were analyzed, and plasma levels of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were studied by Clauss assay and ELISA, respectively.Results:Clot maximum absorbance was increased in females compared with males (0.37 ± 0.005 and 0.34 ± 0.005 arbitrary unit, respectively; P &lt; 0.001), and took longer to lyse (803 ± 20 and 665 ± 12 sec, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These gender differences in clot structure and fibrinolysis were still evident after correcting for fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prothrombotic fibrin structure profile was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased body mass index</z:mp> and low levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> in women and with inadequate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clot formation time was related to previous cardiac ischemic events in both men and women after adjusting for traditional risk factors [odds ratio, 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.07, 1.38); and 1.33 (1.15, 1.50), respectively], and prothrombotic clots were associated with low ankle brachial index, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>, and smoking, regardless of gender.Conclusions:Women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have compact clots with compromised fibrinolysis compared with men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are gender-specific associations between clotting parameters and cardiometabolic risk factors in this population, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo>, and smoking are associated with prothrombotic clot structure profile regardless of gender </plain></SENT>
