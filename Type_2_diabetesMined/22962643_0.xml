<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large number of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> do not reach currently recommended glycaemic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This article looks at how clinical inertia contributes to suboptimal glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, describes the 'legacy' effect of early high HbA1c levels and highlights the importance of early, tight glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Early, tight glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been shown to result in better outcomes in terms of micro- and macrovascular disease and mortality even if control is relaxed later in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
