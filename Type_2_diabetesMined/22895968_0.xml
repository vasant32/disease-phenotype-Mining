<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) is not only a nutritious vegetable but it is also used in traditional medical practices to treat type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies with animals and humans suggested that the vegetable has a possible role in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of mormodica charantia for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SEARCH METHODS: Several electronic databases were searched, among these were The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2012),Â MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SIGLE and LILACS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> up to February 2012), combined with handsearches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No language restriction was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared momordica charantia with placebo or a control intervention, with or without pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk of bias of the trials was evaluated using the parameters of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other potential sources of bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was not performed given the quality of data and the variability of preparations of momordica charantia used in the interventions (no similar preparation was tested twice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Four randomised controlled trials with up to three months duration and investigating 479 participants met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk of bias of these trials (only two studies were published as a full peer-reviewed publication) was generally high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two RCTs compared the effects of preparations from different parts of the momordica charantia plant with placebo on glycaemic control in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the glycaemic control with momordica charantia preparations compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When momordica charantia was compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, there was also no significant change in reliable parameters of glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse effects were reported in any trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No trial investigated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause, morbidity, health-related quality of life or costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence on the effects of momordica charantia for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further studies are therefore required to address the issues of standardization and the quality control of preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For medical nutritional therapy, further observational trials evaluating the effects of momordica charantia are needed before RCTs are established to guide any recommendations in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
