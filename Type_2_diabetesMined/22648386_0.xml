<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The developmental origins hypothesis proposes that undernutrition during early development is associated with an increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between undernutrition during childhood and young adulthood and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 7,837 women from Prospect-EPIC (European Prospective Investigation Into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition) who were exposed to the 1944-1945 Dutch famine when they were between age 0 and 21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to explore the effect of famine on the risk of subsequent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We adjusted for potential confounders, including age at famine exposure, smoking, and level of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Self-reported famine exposure during childhood and young adulthood was associated with an increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those who reported moderate famine exposure, the age-adjusted type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> hazard ratio (HR) was 1.36 (95% CI [1.09-1.70]); in those who reported severe famine exposure, the age-adjusted HR was 1.64 (1.26-2.14) relative to unexposed women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects did not change after adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first direct evidence, using individual famine exposure data, that a short period of moderate or severe undernutrition during postnatal development increases type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in adulthood </plain></SENT>
