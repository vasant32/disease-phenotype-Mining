<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We analyzed the effects of insulin therapy, age and gender on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) according to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a prospective cohort study (Japan Cholesterol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> Study) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (n = 4014) for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of fatal/non-fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> and/or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, which occurred at rates of 7.9 and 7.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided diabetic patients into four groups based on age (≤ 70 and &gt; 70) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1C levels (≤ 7.0 and &gt; 7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> was associated with high systolic blood pressure and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> in patients under 70 years of age with fair glycemic control and was associated with low diastolic blood pressure in the older/fair group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, insulin use was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> in the older/poor group (OR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.11-5.89; p = 0.026) and was associated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> in the older/fair group (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.06-4.25; p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> was associated with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in younger/poor glycemic control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results by stepwise analysis were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next, patients were divided into four groups based on gender and diabetic control(hemoglobinA1C &lt; or &gt; 7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> was associated with high systolic blood pressure in male/fair glycemic control group, age in male/poor control group, and short duration of diabetic history in females in both glycemic control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, insulin use was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> in the male/poor group(OR = 4.11, 95% CI = 1.22-8.12; p = 0.018) and with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> in the female/poor group(OR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.12-6.24; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> was associated with short duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both female groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> risks are affected by specific factors in diabetics, such as treatment, gender and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Specifically, insulin use has a potential role in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> but may also be a risk factor for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> among the diabetic elderly, thus revealing a need to develop improved treatment strategies for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Japan Cholesterol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> Study was formulated to evaluate them(Umin Clinical Trials Registry, clinical trial reg. no </plain></SENT>
