<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These interactions are disturbed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with implications for disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the implications of such disturbances on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and rice consumption, the results of which could affect management of the disease in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a type 2 diabetic rat model induced through a combination of high fat diet and low dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> injection, up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> metabolism genes in the diabetic untreated group was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">Xenobiotic</z:chebi> metabolism genes were upregulated more in the white rice (WR) group than the diabetic untreated group while the brown rice (BR) group showed significantly lower expression values, though not as effective as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, which gave values closer to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> non-diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fold changes in expression in the WR group compared to the BR group for Cyp2D4, Cyp3A1, Cyp4A1, Cyp2B1, Cyp2E1, Cyp2C11, UGT2B1, ALDH1A1 and Cyp2C6 were 2.6, 2, 1.5, 4, 2.8, 1.5, 1.8, 3 and 5, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that WR may upregulate these genes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> more than BR, potentially causing faster drug metabolism, less drug efficacy and more toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results may have profound implications for rice eating populations, constituting half the world's population </plain></SENT>
