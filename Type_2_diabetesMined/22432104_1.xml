<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, 12-week study of 361 patients not on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapy (HbA(1c) 7-10%) allocated to one of four once-daily subcutaneous dose increase regimens: lixisenatide 2-step (10 μg for 1 week, 15 μg for 1 week, and then 20 μg; n = 120), lixisenatide 1-step (10 μg for 2 weeks and then 20 μg; n = 119), placebo 2-step (n = 61), or placebo 1-step (n = 61) (placebo groups were combined for analyses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was HbA(1c) change from baseline to week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Once-daily lixisenatide significantly improved HbA(1c) (mean baseline 8.0%) in both groups (least squares mean change vs. placebo: -0.54% for 2-step, -0.66% for 1-step; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more lixisenatide patients achieved HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% (52.2% 2-step, 46.5% 1-step) and ≤ 6.5% (31.9% 2-step, 25.4% 1-step) versus placebo (26.8% and 12.5%, respectively; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lixisenatide led to marked significant improvements of 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions measured during a standardized breakfast test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was observed in both lixisenatide groups versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean decreases in body weight (∼2 kg) were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> was the most frequent (lixisenatide 23% overall, placebo 4.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred in 1.7% of lixisenatide and 1.6% of placebo patients, with no severe episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Safety/tolerability was similar for the two dose regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily lixisenatide monotherapy significantly improved glycemic control with a pronounced postprandial effect (75% reduction in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion) and was safe and well tolerated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
