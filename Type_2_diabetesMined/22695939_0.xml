<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a cross-sectional study of 506 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 28-75 years, usual dietary intakes were assessed by means of a 168-item food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To calculate the estimated hydrophilic-ORAC, total ORAC, and total phenolics (TP) of fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts for each participant, we used the United States Department of Agriculture Database for ORAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations between total ORAC and TP scores, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, a higher total ORAC score was associated with lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (ORs) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;140 mm Hg across increasing quartiles of the total ORAC score were 1.0, 0.71, 0.38 and 0.56 (P for trend=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ORs of diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) &gt;90 mm Hg across increasing quartiles of the total ORAC score were 1.0, 0.59, 0.47 and 0.35 (P for trend=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for energy, protein and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> intakes slightly strengthened these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate ORs of elevated SBP across quartiles of TP score were 1.0, 0.83, 0.41 and 0.63 (P for trend=0.027), and for elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> were 1.0, 0.50, 0.40 and 0.38 (P for trend=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for energy, protein and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> intakes did not change the results materially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity of the dietary intake was negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients.Journal of Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> advance online publication, 14 June 2012; doi:10.1038/jhh.2012.19 </plain></SENT>
