<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>YKL-40 has been established as an inflammatory marker in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of plasma and urine YKL-40 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in the early stage of type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 75 type 2 diabetic patients and 22 nondiabetic controls with estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) â‰¥60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma and urine concentrations of YKL-40 were analyzed by ELISA kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma levels of YKL-40 were significantly higher in the normoalbuminuric group with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in the control group, and increased with increasing severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> among <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, urine YKL-40 was only increased in macroalbuminuric state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma YKL-40 was positively correlated with urine YKL-40 (r=0.291, P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin significantly correlated with both plasma and urine YKL-40 in a univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for several confounding factors, plasma YKL-40 was significantly correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (r=0.359; P=0.001), whereas urine YKL-40 did not show significant correlation with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (r=0.128, P=0.241) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although urine YKL-40 has a limited role, plasma YKL-40, as an proinflammatory marker, was an independent factor associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and might have an useful role as a noninvasive marker for the early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
