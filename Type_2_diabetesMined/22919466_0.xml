<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of present study is to observe the association between the levels of ankle-brachial index (ABI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> among people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in north India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study was carried out at a centre for heart and diabetic clinic in the state of Punjab on 1121 subjects (671 males and 450 females) with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>History of symptoms related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> was noted, and blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured using ultrasonic Doppler flow detector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with ABI ≤0.9 and ≥1.30 were classified as having low and high ABI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Females had a higher BMI and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas, males had higher diastolic blood pressure and duration of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences of systolic blood pressure and ankle-brachial index were not found significant between the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of low ABI (&lt;0.9) was 4.47% in men and 4.67% in women and high ABI (≥1.30) was prevalent in 14% of men and 10.45% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, BMI, baPWV, and blood pressures were significantly associated with ABI value in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the ABI might be used as a strong indicator for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
