<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a complex pathology, comprising altered insulin sensitivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in the understanding of the physiological functions of incretins and their degrading enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4 have led to the 'discovery' of a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several DPP-4 inhibitors (or gliptins) with different chemical structures are now available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These agents inhibit the degradation of the incretins glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) and hence potentiate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors inhibit DPP-4 activity by almost 100% in vitro, maintaining a â‰¥ 80% inhibition throughout the treatment period in vivo, thus prolonging GLP-1 half-life, and significantly reducing HbA1c generally by -0.7 to 0.8% as well as fasting and post-prandial glycaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They are well-tolerated with no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and few adverse effects, and, of particular interest, no increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although different by their chemical structure and pharmacokinetic properties, the DPP4 inhibitors currently available have proven similar <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering efficacy </plain></SENT>
