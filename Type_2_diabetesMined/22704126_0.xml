<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a global health issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with poor glycemic control often suffer from cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, neuropathic, and nephropathic complications as well as other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic guidelines recommend that diabetic patients should maintain their HbA(1c) level below a certain target in order to minimize the risk of developing complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is recognized as a major impediment to the adequate control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> can manifest symptoms of varying degrees of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a post hoc Taiwan subgroup analysis of these data collected in the RECAP-DM study to indicate probably more emphasis and concern on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, we found no significant difference was observed in treatment-related satisfaction between Taiwanese patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another finding of our study further shows that varying order of hypoglycemic symptoms or severity has no effect on patients' assessment of health-related quality of life scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We need to pay more attention to this issue because of its enduring impact on compliance and concerns about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, socio-demographic characteristics are also important factors influencing glycemic control and patients' health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future interventions and therapeutic algorithms should emphasize the probable patients' unawareness or neglect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
