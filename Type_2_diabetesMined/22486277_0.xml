<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited data to support that these effects are sustained in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on endogenous glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity and active ghrelin (an orexigenic hormone) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight subjects [six male, age 58.7 ± 2.6 years, BMI 41.1 ± 2.9 kg/m(2) , HbA(1c) 69 ± 6 mmol/mol (8.5 ± 0.5%), mean ± sem] with drug-naïve Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied for 6 h following a standard mixed meal, before and after at least 3 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (mean dose 1.75 g daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC(0-6 h) ) for active glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 was significantly higher on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (pre-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1750.8 ± 640 pmol l(-1) min(-1) vs. post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 2718.8 ± 1182.3 pmol l(-1) min(-1) ; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The areas under the curves for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity and ghrelin were not significantly different pre- and post-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three months or more of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with increased postprandial active glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on the enteroinsular axis may represent yet another important mechanism underlying its <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects </plain></SENT>
