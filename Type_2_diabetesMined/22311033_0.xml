<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thus far only a limited number of studies examined the association between endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) polymorphisms and proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, two polymorphisms in the eNOS gene have been investigated, namely the 894G&gt;T (Glu298Asp) and a 27 bp VNTR (4b/4a), to assess their possible relationships to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> among Slovenian (Caucasians) type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional case-control study enrolled 577 unrelated Slovenian subjects (Caucasians) with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case group consisted of 172 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> and the control group had 405 patients who had no clinical signs of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) but did have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for more than 10 years' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of eNOS polymorphisms was carried out with conventional and real-time PCR assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher frequency of the eNOS minor "4a" allele was found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> than in controls (23.6 versus 17.7%, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the univariate analysis showed a significant association of the 27 bp VNTR 4a/4a genotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> in the recessive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> for the 4a/4a genotype to 4b/4a plus 4b/4b was 2.9 (95% CI 1.3-6.2, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the presence of 4a/a genotype was associated with a 3.4-fold (95% CI 1.4-8.6, p = 0.009) increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> while adjusted for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to implicate eNOS 4a/4a homozygous deletion, and hence the "4a" allele, as the genetic risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
