<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) in Asia is growing at an alarming rate, posing significant clinical and economic risk to health care stakeholders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Commonly, Asian patients with T2D manifest a distinctive combination of characteristics that include earlier disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, distinct pathophysiology, syndrome of complications, and shorter life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optimizing treatment outcomes for such patients requires a coordinated inclusive care plan and knowledgeable practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive management starts with medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in a broader lifestyle modification program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Implementing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific MNT in Asia requires high-quality and transparent clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) that are regionally adapted for cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respected CPGs for nutrition and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy are available from prestigious medical societies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For cost efficiency and effectiveness, health care authorities can select these CPGs for Asian implementation following abridgement and cultural adaptation that includes: defining nutrition therapy in meaningful ways, selecting lower cutoff values for healthy body mass indices and waist circumferences (WCs), identifying the dietary composition of MNT based on regional availability and preference, and expanding nutrition therapy for concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An international task force of respected health care professionals has contributed to this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To date, task force members have selected appropriate evidence-based CPGs and simplified them into an algorithm for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific nutrition therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following cultural adaptation, Asian and Asian-Indian versions of this algorithmic tool have emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Asian version is presented in this report </plain></SENT>
