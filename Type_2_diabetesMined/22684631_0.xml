<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vegetables and fruit provide a significant part of human nutrition, as they are important sources of nutrients, dietary fibre, and phytochemicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is uncertain whether the risk of certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases can be reduced by increased consumption of vegetables or fruit by the general public, and what strength of evidence has to be allocated to such an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the studies available in the literature and the respective study results has been performed and evaluated regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye diseases</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For judgement, the strength of evidence for a risk association, the level of evidence, and the number of studies were considered, the quality of the studies and their estimated relevance based on study design and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, CHD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, there is convincing evidence that increasing the consumption of vegetables and fruit reduces the risk of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is probable evidence that the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in general is inversely associated with the consumption of vegetables and fruit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is possible evidence that an increased consumption of vegetables and fruit may prevent body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As overweight is the most important risk factor for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, an increased consumption of vegetables and fruit therefore might indirectly reduces the incidence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent of overweight, there is probable evidence that there is no influence of increased consumption on the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is possible evidence that increasing the consumption of vegetables and fruit lowers the risk of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Likewise, current data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, COPD, and RA indicate that an increase in vegetable and fruit consumption may contribute to the prevention of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For IBD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, there was insufficient evidence regarding an association with the consumption of vegetables and fruit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This critical review on the associations between the intake of vegetables and fruit and the risk of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases shows that a high daily intake of these foods promotes health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, from a scientific point of view, national campaigns to increase vegetable and fruit consumption are justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The promotion of vegetable and fruit consumption by nutrition and health policies is a preferable strategy to decrease the burden of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases in Western societies </plain></SENT>
