<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether type 2 DM is a risk factor for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure and the potential predictive factors for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure among type 2 DM patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A case-control study was performed using hospital medical records of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients treated with a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 DM and other risk factors (established &gt;1 y before study enrollment) was determined in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure (treatment with more than once daily <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) as compared with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 732 GERD patients receiving <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy, including 285 who failed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure was significantly higher in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure and type 2 DM depended on body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients the odds ratio of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure was significantly higher in type 2 DM as compared with non-DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with type 2 DM (n=349), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure was significantly associated with female sex, the presence of general comorbidities, and adequate DM control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Duration of DM, type of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication prescribed, and DM-associated complications were not associated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> failure was significantly associated with type 2 DM in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with type 2 DM, failure of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment was significantly associated with female sex and the presence of general comorbidities </plain></SENT>
