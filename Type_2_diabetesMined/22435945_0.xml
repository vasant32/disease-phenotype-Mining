<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise mechanisms have not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we attempted to elucidate the association of clinical indices and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> at baseline with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive declines</z:hpo> after 6-year follow up in type 2 diabetic elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 261 participants who were administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline and after 6 years, at the end of the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was determined as a 5-point or greater decline in MMSE scores during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis to find the factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, adjusted for age and sex, were carried out, and factors with P-values of less than 0.2 were included in four models of multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the existence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, higher systolic blood pressure and higher serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (or lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>) at baseline were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive declines</z:hpo> after 6 years in Japanese elderly diabetics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The comorbidity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> at baseline were associated with more than 5-point declines in MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of this association is warranted </plain></SENT>
