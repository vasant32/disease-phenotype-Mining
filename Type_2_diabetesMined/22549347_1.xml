<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to compare concentration of soluble RAGE and its ligands (EN-RAGE and HMGB1) with different biochemical parameters in Type 1 (T1DM) and Type 2 (T2DM) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>.Total number of 154 persons (45 T1DM, 68 T2DM, 41 controls) was examined and concentrations of sRAGE, EN-RAGE and HMGB1 were measured and compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and metalloproteinases (MMPs).Mean serum sRAGE concentration was higher in T1DM as compared to controls (1137±532 ng/l vs. 824±309 ng/l, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, EN-RAGE was significantly higher in both diabetic groups (p&lt;0.001) and HMGB1 concentrations were elevated in T2DM patients (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant relationship was found between MMP9 and HMGB1 and EN-RAGE in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inverse relationship was observed between MMP2 and MMP9 in both types of diabetic patients (r= - 0.602, p&lt;0.002 and r= - 0.771, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant positive correlation was found between sRAGE and ICAM-1, VCAM-1 or vWF (p&lt;0.01 to p&lt;0.001).We conclude that serum sRAGE and RAGE ligands concentrations reflect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> developing in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
