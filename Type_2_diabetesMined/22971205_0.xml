<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Glycemic goals (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c less than  7%) are often not achieved in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> despite the availability of many effective treatments and the documented benefits of glycemic control in the reduction of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have established the important positive effects of pharmacist-led management on achieving glycemic control and other clinical outcomes in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> prevalence and mortality are increasing rapidly in Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, clinical pharmacists in Jordan do not typically provide pharmaceutical care; instead, the principal responsibilities of pharmacists in Jordan are dispensing and marketing of medical products to physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the primary clinical outcome of glycemic control (A1c) and secondary outcomes, including blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> values, self-reported medication adherence, and self-care activities for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic randomly assigned to either usual care or a pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care intervention program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attending an outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic of a large teaching hospital were recruited over a 4-month period from January through April 2011 and randomly assigned to intervention and usual care groups using the Minim software technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intervention group at baseline received face-to-face objective-directed education from a clinical pharmacist about type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, prescription medications, and necessary lifestyle changes, followed by 8 weekly telephone follow-up calls to discuss and review the prescribed treatment plan and to resolve any patient concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was glycemic control (A1c), and secondary measures included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, complete <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile (i.e., total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>], <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>], serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>), and self-reported medication adherence (4-item Morisky Scale) and self-care activities (Summary of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Self-Care Activities questionnaire) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline to follow-up were calculated for biomarker values, and between-group differences in the change amounts were tested using the t test for independent samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A P value of less than  0.05 was considered  statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 77 of 85 patients (90.6%) randomly assigned to the intervention group and 79 of 86 patients (91.9%) assigned to usual care had baseline and 6-month follow-up values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline values, patients in the intervention group had a mean reduction of 0.8% in A1c versus a mean increase of 0.1% from baseline in the usual care group (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The intervention group compared with the usual care group had small but statistically significant improvements in the secondary measures of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, self-reported medication adherence, and self-care activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Between-group differences in changes in the secondary measures of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and body mass index were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who received pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care in an outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic experienced reduction in A1c at 6 months compared with essentially no change in the usual care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Six of 8 secondary biomarkers were improved in the intervention group compared with usual care </plain></SENT>
