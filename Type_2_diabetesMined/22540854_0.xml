<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is believed to exert, besides others, positive effects on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or its secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are several reports dealing with the DHEA levels and its effects in the type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, but less information is available on the type 1 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a report dealing with the lack of the age-dependent decline of the DHEA levels in the type 2 diabetic subjects was published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to answer the question whether a comparable change in the aging pattern of the DHEA and its <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> could be detected in the type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data regarding the DHEA and dehydroepiandrosterone <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> (DHEA-S) concentrations in the serum obtained from 116 patients with the type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 259 controls were gathered from the database of the Institute of Endocrinology (Prague, Czech Republic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences in the level of the DHEA-S were found between the type 1 diabetics and controls either in men or women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, lower DHEA levels were found in the type 1 diabetic women, but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-dependent declines of both the DHEA and DHEA-S were similar to those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In contrast to the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the levels of DHEA-S in the type 1 diabetic patients were practically identical with those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to men, in women, the DHEA basal levels were lower than those seen in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The age dependence of both hormones followed the pattern of the decline in controls </plain></SENT>
