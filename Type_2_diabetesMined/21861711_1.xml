<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-10 has met the criteria for an anti-inflammatory and an immunosuppressive cytokine, its activity may be important for clinical outcome of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at evaluating the relation between the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the IL-10 (-1082G/A) polymorphisms, and their association with the risk to develop DN in the Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The (IL)-10 (-1082G/A) genotypes were retrospectively determined in 43 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and 48 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and a control group of 112 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This genotype distribution was different between control subjects and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in which 24.2% were AA, 75.8% were GA, and 0% were GG (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the mutant G allele was 36.1% in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> versus 39.6% in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies were AA, 27.9%; GA, 72.1%; and GG, 0% in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> versus AA, 20.8%; GA, 79.2%; and GG, 0% in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphisms of IL-10 (-1082G/A) genes were significantly associated with the occurrence of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IL-10 (-1082G/A) genotype and allele frequencies were not different between patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that the IL-10 (-1082G/A) gene polymorphism is not associated with the development of DN in Turkish patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
