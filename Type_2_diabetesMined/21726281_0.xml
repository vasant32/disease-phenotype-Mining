<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: During a period of 12 months, we evaluated the longitudinal impact of metabolic control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on selected bone turnover markers, bone mineral density and serum adiponectin concentrations in post-menopausal women with newly diagnosed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum total adiponectin, bone alkaline phosphatase, HbA(1c), urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion, bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine and total hip were measured in 57 women aged 50-78 years with newly diagnosed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, women had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, deoxypyridinoline and bone mineral density, as evaluated by t- and z-scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 12 months of treatment, a significant decrease in body weight, waist circumference and HbA(1c) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine and total hip decreased by 0.4, 0.2 and 1.0% (P = 0.018) per year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was inversely correlated with bone mineral density at three sites (R = -0.28, -0.24 and -0.19, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a transient increase (P &lt; 0.05) in serum adiponectin within the first 6 months, followed by a slow decrease toward the baseline value during the next 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control had no impact on bone turnover marker levels, which did not change significantly during the entire study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bone turnover markers, bone mineral density and the rate of bone loss are within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges in post-menopausal women with newly diagnosed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine and total hip is inversely correlated with total adiponectin </plain></SENT>
