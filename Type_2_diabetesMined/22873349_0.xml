<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> on the expression of adiponectin receptor 2 (adipoR2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>) oxidase subunits in the heart and the expression of adiponectin receptor 1 (adipoR1) in aorta in type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was induced by high-fat and high-sugar diet and intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heart function, adipoR2, p22phox, NOX4, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 4(GLUT4), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) and connective tissue growth factor CTGFin the heart, and adipoR1, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in aorta were analyzed in controls and diabetic rats treated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> (5mg/kg/d) by gavage for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heart function, plasma and myocardial adiponectin levels, the expression of myocardial adipoR2 and GLUT4 were significantly decreased in diabetic rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of myocardial p22phox, NOX4, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, and CTGF was significantly increased in diabetic rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of adipoR1 was decreased and the expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and NF-kappaB was increased in the abdominal aorta in diabetic rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment significantly attenuated these changes in diabetic rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> upregulates the expression of myocardial adiponectin, its receptor 2 and GLUT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, it downregulates the expression of myocardial p22phox, NOX4, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, and CTGF, contributing so to the improvement of heart function in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> also induces a protective role on the vascular system by upregulating the expression of adipoR1 and downregulating the expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and NF-kappaB in the abdominal aorta in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
