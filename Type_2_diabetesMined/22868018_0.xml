<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Management Centre, Services Hospital, Lahore, from November 2009 to January 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Forty well controlled and forty poorly controlled type 2 diabetic subjects having good oral hygiene (scored according to simplified oral hygiene index) were compared with a control group of forty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probing depth (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017572" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gingival recession</z:e> (GR), and attachment loss (AL) were recorded to obtain the periodontal status of each tooth, using a Michigan probe "0" with Williams marking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was evaluated by glycated Hb value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using ANOVA and independent sample t-test, mean probing depth and attachment loss in each tooth type (incisors, canines, premolars and molars) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of diabetic subjects was 58.86 ± 6.21 years and that of control group was 56.92 ± 6.91 years; 60% were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Probing depth was greater in patients with poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to well controlled diabetic patients and non-diabetic controls (4.21 mm vs. 3.72 mm and 2.93 mm respectively, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Attachment loss also increased in poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.001) compared to the control group and well controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, however, the difference was not statistically significant when comparing well controlled to the control group (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Number of sites and mean percentage of sites with attachment loss of ³ 4 and ³ 6 mm was also significantly higher in poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Periodontal status as estimated by probing depth and degree of attachment loss deteriorates significantly with poor glycemic control in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
