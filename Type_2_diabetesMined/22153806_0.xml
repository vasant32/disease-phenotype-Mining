<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin may inhibit platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of the current study were to identify factors associated with in vitro SPA measured by a laser light scattering method and to investigate the effects of short-term glycemic control and adiponectin on SPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In study 1, we investigated platelet aggregation in 20 healthy control subjects and 82 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In study 2, we evaluated the changes of SPA and serum high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin after 2 weeks of improved glycemic control in 20 hospitalized diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In study 3, using washed platelets from 10 healthy subjects, in vitro SPA was measured over 15 min in the absence or presence of recombinant adiponectin (20 Î¼g/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was assessed with a laser light scatter aggregometer that measured the size of platelet aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SPA was defined as formation of small aggregates under constant stirring in the absence of any <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve was calculated for SPA and also for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-induced small, medium, and large aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SPA was increased in diabetic patients compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, SPA was correlated positively with plasma fibrinogen, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycated albumin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A stepwise multivariate analysis showed that plasma fibrinogen was the strongest independent determinant of SPA in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 20 diabetic patients, SPA decreased significantly after 2 weeks of glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A significant negative correlation was found between changes of SPA and those of HMW adiponectin during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The in vitro study showed that adiponectin inhibited the spontaneous aggregation of washed platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> are associated independently with SPA in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>SPA is reduced after even short-term improvement of glycemic control and adiponectin also inhibits SPA directly </plain></SENT>
