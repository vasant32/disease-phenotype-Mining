<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent publications have found an association between variants of exostosin 2 (EXT2) gene and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in some population but not in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to address these inconsistencies, we investigated EXT2 variants in two independent cohorts, and conducted a literature-based meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through regression model, we assessed the relationship between the EXT2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3740878, rs11037909 and rs1113132) and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Han Chinese population, including a total of 2,533 cases and 2,643 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We combined our data with that from previously published studies and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect size of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with some studies, we found marginal association for the rs3740878 (OR = 1.07, 95 % CI = 0.99, 1.16, p = 0.09), rs11037909 (OR = 1.07, 95 % CI = 0.99, 1.16, p = 0.08), and rs1113132 (OR = 1.08, 95 % CI = 1.00, 1.17, p = 0.06) in our 2 cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis, comprising 9,224 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 10,484 controls, revealed that three SNPs (rs3740878, rs11037909 and rs1113132) in EXT2 were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (ORs range from 1.06 to 1.07, p = 0.038, p = 0.008 and p = 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variation in the EXT2 locus appears to be associated with a small increase in the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, well-designed prospective studies with larger sample size and more ethnic groups are needed to further validate the results </plain></SENT>
