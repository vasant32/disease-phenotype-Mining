<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that beta cell function progressively declines in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on declining beta cell function after diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a cross-sectional study of 689 consecutive subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were admitted to our hospital from 2000 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting and postprandial serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> immunoreactivity (CPR) and urinary CPR levels had been measured during admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were stratified according to BMI and time since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CPR index was calculated as CPR (ng/mL) / plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (mg/dL) x 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CPR measurements were significantly higher in the 263 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI â‰¥25) subjects compared to the 426 lean subjects (BMI &lt;25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between CPR indices and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting a progressive decline in beta cell function after diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this decline was more apparent in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (postprandial CPR index 0.059/year) compared to lean subjects (0.025/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significant difference in serum CPR indices between the lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects was lost in subjects more than 10 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our observations suggest that beta cell function shows a greater progressive decline in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects than in lean subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be an important strategy to preserve beta cell function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
