<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Localization of CCK-1R in kidney of diabetic patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was examined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The glomeruli did not express CCK-1R in either control or diabetic nephropathic kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the expressions of CCK-1R protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in tubules were significantly increased in DN, which had no relationship with the severity of DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of cells positive for CCK-1R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased CCK-1R expression could be demonstrated in the tubules and the CCK-1R might be implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in human DN </plain></SENT>
