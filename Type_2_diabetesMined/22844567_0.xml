<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects included male who had received biennial medical check-ups between 2005 and 2009 and who had been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects with sustained NAFLD (FL, n=107) and sustained non-NAFLD (NFL, n=1,054) were followed to determine the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the FL group, there were more subjects with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and high HOMA-IR than there were in the NFL group during the 5-year follow-up period (32.7 vs. 17.6%, 1.9 vs. 0.3%, 17.9 vs. 5.2% respectively, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FL group showed a higher risk than NFL group for abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism as determined using IFG (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; confidence interval [CI], 1.36 to 3.35), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR, 7.63; 95% CI, 1.03 to 56.79) and high HOMA-IR (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.79 to 5.91) and metabolic parameters such as body mass index (OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.87 to 6.02), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.92 to 4.86) and fasting blood sugar (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.39 to 3.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sustained NAFLD appears to be associated with an increased risk for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and deterioration of metabolic parameters in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, non-diabetic Korean men </plain></SENT>
