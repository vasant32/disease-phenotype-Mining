<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose:  The <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> blood vessels provide a unique way to directly examine the human microvasculature, which is frequently damaged in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> flickering light-induced vasodilation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>-induced vasoconstriction may operate by enhancing or reducing similar vasoregulatory factor(s), but a comparison between these two provocative stimuli in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to examine the association between <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> flickering light-induced vasodilation and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>-induced vasoconstriction in type 2 diabetic subjects and in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods:  Twenty men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 10 men and women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 21 and 75 years of age were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery and vein diameters to flickering light and during <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (100% oxygen) stimuli were measured on the same visit using a noninvasive <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> imaging device (Dynamic Vessel Analyzer, Imedos Inc., Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results:  Compared with controls, diabetic subjects had impaired arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> and vasoconstrictor responses to both flickering light and <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>, respectively (both p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Merging both groups, an inverse correlation (r = -0.56; p = 0.003) between the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery's responses to flickering light-induced vasodilation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>-induced vasoconstriction was demonstrated independent of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  This suggests that both responses are attenuated to a similar degree in diabetic subjects and that the attenuation to both stimuli can be observed in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This would suggest that similar vasoregulatory factor(s) might in part help to explain the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> diameter responses between the two stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One suggested common vasoregulator of vascular tone is nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>; however, other factor(s) may be involved, which contribute to this association and require further research </plain></SENT>
