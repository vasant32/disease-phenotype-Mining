<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the association of polymorphisms of the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase 1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP) gene with QT interval in Chinese subjects with or without Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10494366, rs12143842 and rs12029454) were genotyped in 1240 Type 2 diabetic patients (631 men and 609 women) and 1196 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (433 men and 763 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals with overt diseases other than <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart-rate corrected QT interval (QTc) was determined by standard 12-lead ECG and Bazett formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sex-pooled analysis and sex-specific analysis for genotype-phenotype association were both conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the diabetic group, the rs12143842 T allele was associated with a 3.87-ms (P = 0.014, empirical P = 0.039) increase in QTc duration for each additional allele copy, while rs10494366 and rs12029454 exhibited no significant association with QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence of association for the three SNPs in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant SNP-gender and -<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> affection interaction was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The genetic variant rs12143842 in NOS1AP is associated with QT interval duration in a Chinese population with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies in different populations are needed to validate this finding and to evaluate the impact of NOS1AP variants on cardiovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
