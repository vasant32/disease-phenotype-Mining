<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Associations of type 2 DM status, duration and insulin use with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancer</z:e> overall, and with serous and non-serous histologic subtypes were examined in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective study of U.S. men and women predominantly aged 50 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1992 and 2007, 524 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancer</z:e> cases were identified among 63,440 post-menopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using extended Cox regression to updated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status and bilateral oophorectomy status during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 DM status (RR=1.05, 95% CI 0.75-1.46) and duration were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significantly different (Pdifference=0.39), the RR was higher for type 2 DM with insulin use (RR=1.28, 95% CI 0.74, 2.24) than for type 2 DM without insulin use (RR=0.96, 95%: CI 0.64, 1.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> appeared to be more strongly associated with non-serous (RR=1.41, 95%: CI 0.70, 2.85) than serous (RR=0.71, 95%: CI 0.41, 1.23) histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 DM was not associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancer</z:e>, although higher risks with non-serous subtypes and among insulin users cannot be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impact: Larger studies are needed to clarify associations of type 2 DM with or without insulin use with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> overall and by histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
