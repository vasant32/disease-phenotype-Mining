<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective non-randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty consecutive hospitalized patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ocular inflammatory reaction after VRS were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients received 2.5 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and 10 patients received 5 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen consecutive type 2 diabetic patients without ocular inflammatory reaction after VRS were used as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) and at 2 h after each meal (post prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, PBG; 09:00, 13:00, and 19:00 h) after periocular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences among three groups were determined by q tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PBG levels in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-treated groups started to increase within 5 h after injection (i.e., PBG at 13:00 h), and were significantly increased at 19:00 h after injection (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BG levels were almost 2-fold higher than at baseline and compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The BG values declined gradually by 24 h to 48 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in BG levels between the two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-treated groups (P&gt;0.05), except for PBG at 19:00 h on day 2 after injection (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Periocular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> injection can cause transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in diabetic patients after VRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BG monitoring should be performed following such injection </plain></SENT>
