<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review aims to summarize recent advances towards understanding the relation of the activities of D5D and D6D to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Prospective studies that investigated fatty acid product-to-precursor ratios in blood as estimates of desaturase activity reported a clear inverse relation of D5D activity and a strong direct relation of D6D activity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the prospective design and comprehensive confounder adjustment in these studies, confounding and reverse causation are unlikely explanations for these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, studies on genetic variation in the FADS1 and FADS2 genes, which encode D5D and D6D, also point to an influence of D5D and D6D activity on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inverse relation of D5D activity and the direct relation of D6D activity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk have been corroborated by a Mendelian randomization approach recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: These recent studies suggest an important role of D5D and D6D activities for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors which influence the activities of these desaturases are likely to be of public health relevance </plain></SENT>
