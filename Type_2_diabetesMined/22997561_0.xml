<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of educational program and jogging based on health belief model (HBM) on sugar control in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred diabetic (type 2) patients were involved in this prospective quasi-experimental interventional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly divided into two groups of experimental and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data was collected using a questionnaire based on the HBM model, a check list for patient`s practices and a check list for recording the patient`s <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1C) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our findings indicated that after intervention, there was a significant difference between the mean score of the HBM model variables (susceptibility, severity, benefit and perceived obstacles,) in the experimental group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, behavioral jogging, level of HbA1C and FBS levels improved significantly among the experimental group when compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Applying the HBM model was found to be a very effective means for developing an educational program of jogging for diabetics, in order to control their blood sugar </plain></SENT>
