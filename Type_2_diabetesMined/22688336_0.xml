<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diabetic bladder dysfunction (DBD) is common and affects 80% of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DBD remain elusive because of a lack of appropriate animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate DBD in a mouse model that harbors hepatic-specific insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 deletions (double knockout [DKO]), which develops type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bladders of DKO animals exhibited detrusor overactivity at an early stage: increased frequency of nonvoiding contractions during bladder filling, decreased voided volume, and dispersed urine spot patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, older animals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exhibited detrusor <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp>, findings consistent with clinical features of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) superfamily genes were upregulated in DKO bladders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, TNF-α was upregulated in serum and in bladder smooth muscle tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNF-α augmented the contraction of primary cultured bladder smooth muscle cells through upregulating Rho kinase activity and phosphorylating myosin light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systemic treatment of DKO animals with soluble TNF receptor 1 (TNFRI) prevented upregulation of Rho A signaling and reversed the bladder dysfunction, without affecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNFRI combined with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, improved DBD beyond that achieved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone, suggesting that therapies targeting TNF-α may have utility in reversing the secondary urologic complications of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
