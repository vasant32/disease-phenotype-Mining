<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aerobic exercise training has been shown to improve CRP; however, there are limited data evaluating the effect of other exercise training modalities (aerobic, resistance, or combination training) in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants (n = 204) were randomized to an aerobic exercise (aerobic), resistance exercise (resistance), or a combination of both (combination) for 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRP was evaluated at baseline and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline CRP was correlated with fat mass, waist circumference, body mass index, and VO(2peak) ̇(P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRP was not reduced after aerobic (0.16 mg·L(-1), 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.0 to 1.3 mg·L(-1)), resistance (-0.03 mg·L(-1), 95% CI = -1.1 to 1.0 mg·L(-1)), or combination (-0.49 mg·L(-1), 95% CI = -1.5 to 0.6 mg·L(-1)) training compared to control (0.35 mg·L(-1), 95% CI = -1.0 to 1.7 mg·L(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r = 0.20, P = 0.009), glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) (r = 0.21, P = 0.005), and fat mass (r = 0.19, P = 0.016) were associated with reductions in CRP but not with change in fitness or weight (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant trends observed for CRP among tertiles of change in HbA1c (P = 0.009) and body fat (P = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic, resistance, or a combination of both did not reduce CRP levels in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, exercise-related improvements in HbA1c, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and fat mass were associated with reductions in CRP </plain></SENT>
