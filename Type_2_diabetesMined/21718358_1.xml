<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1935 subjects of a derivation cohort were followed up for 14 years from 1988 and 1147 subjects of a validation cohort independent of the derivation cohort were followed up for 5 years from 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk scores were estimated based on the coefficients (Î²) of Cox proportional hazards model in the derivation cohort and were verified in the validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, the non-invasive risk model was established using significant risk factors; namely, age, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, abdominal circumference, body mass index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, regular exercise and current smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also created another scoring risk model by adding fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels to the non-invasive model (plus-fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve of the non-invasive model was 0.700 and it increased significantly to 0.772 (P &lt; 0.001) in the plus-fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability of the non-invasive model to predict Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was comparable with that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and the plus-fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> model was superior to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly increased with elevating quintiles of the sum scores of both models in the validation cohort (P for trend &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We developed two practical risk score models for easily identifying individuals at high risk of incident Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
