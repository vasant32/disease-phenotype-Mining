<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to explore the association between HbA(1c) variability and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> development in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also intended to test the applicability of serially measured HbA(1c) over 2 years for this risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, we recruited 821 middle-aged normoalbuminuric individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and followed them through to the end of 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up time was 6.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> as a urine albumin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio of 30 mg/g (3.4 mg/mmol) or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) variability was calculated by the SD of serially measured HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between HbA(1c) SD quartile and development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> for the overall population was 58.4, 58.6, 60.8 and 91.9 per 1,000 person-years for Q1- to Q4-adjusted HbA(1c) SD, respectively (p for trend = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients in Q1, those in Q4 were about 37% more likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HR derived from a series of 2 year HbA(1c) measurements was similar to that from data collection for longer than 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In addition to mean HbA(1c) values, HbA(1c) variability, even measured as early as 2 years, is independently associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
