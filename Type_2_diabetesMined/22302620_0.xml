<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As genetic risk testing based on this knowledge moves into clinical practice, we propose that genetic counselors will need to expand their roles and adapt traditional counseling techniques for this new patient set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we present a genetic counseling intervention developed for a clinical trial [Genetic Counseling/Lifestyle Change for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01034319] designed to motivate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two phenotypically high-risk participants received counseling that included their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk score, general education about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, and encouragement to participate in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using two validated genetic counseling scales, participants reported favorable perceived control and satisfaction with the counseling session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our intervention represents one model for applying traditional genetic counseling principles to risk testing for polygenetic, preventable diseases, such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
