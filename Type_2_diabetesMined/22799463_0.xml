<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently approved agents were initially developed and approved for combination therapy with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential for combined use with insulin has garnered increasing attention due to the potential to reduce side effects associated with insulin therapy and improve glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas covered: We reviewed published and other publicly released data from controlled and uncontrolled studies that included subjects treated with insulin/GLP-1 analog combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The currently available guidance for clinical practice when combining insulin and GLP-1 analogs was also summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expert opinion: Limited data currently available from placebo-controlled trials support the use of exenatide twice daily or liraglutide once daily in combination with basal insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> unable to attain treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several randomized controlled trials are currently studying combinations of insulin with various GLP-1 analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional guidance on the clinical use of these combinations will likely be forthcoming once these studies are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin/GLP-1 analog combinations will require optimization of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring strategies and delivery systems to decrease the risk of administration errors and reduce the potential complexity of these regimens </plain></SENT>
