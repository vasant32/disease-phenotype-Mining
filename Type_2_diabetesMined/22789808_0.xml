<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the associations of mean values and variability in metabolic parameters with the development of DN in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 864 patients who had participated in a comprehensive diabetic care program for at least for 3 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into progressor (n = 180) and non-progressor groups (n = 684) according to the status of progression of DN during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By Cox regression analysis, a higher mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level was observed to be a protective factor against the progression of DN [hazard ratio (95% CI): 0.971(0.953-0.989), P = 0.002] and a higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> variation was found to be associated with a higher risk [hazard ratio (95% CI): 1.177(1.032-1.341), P = 0.015] of DN progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, patients with a higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> variability were found to have the lowest risk of development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated for the first time that type 2 diabetic patients under a standard disease management program who have a stable and a higher mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level were associated with a lower risk of development of DN </plain></SENT>
