<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, protective role of salivary pH, salivary flow rate, and salivary calcium is assessed in the patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>dental caries</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The samples of saliva were collected from 400 patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 and 300 age- and sex- matched controls after getting informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects were classified into four groups according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>dental caries</z:hpo> was counted by decayed, missed, and filled teeth (DMFT) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The salivary pH, flow rate, and calcium levels were found to be low in patients as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, and DMFT score were found to be significantly high in patients than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The glycemic factors were significantly correlated with salivary factors indicating their influence on progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of findings, it is concluded that the suitable salivary pH and flow rate may be regarded as main protective factors against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>dental caries</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Optimum level of salivary calcium may be responsible for continuous supply of calcium to arrest the demineralization and help reduce the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>dental caries</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
