<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> vs. placebo on left ventricular (LV) diastolic and systolic function in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 24 male or female patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45mg/day) or placebo in addition to current therapy for 12weeks using a prospective double blind crossover protocol following a run-in period &gt;1week and a 2week washout period at crossover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue Doppler early peak velocity (e'), a measure of LV diastolic function, was the primary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> significantly increased e' by 0.7(0.1, 1.3) cm/s (mean (95% confidence interval); p=0.02) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> also increased E/A and mitral deceleration index, ejection fraction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and weight, whereas fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, total peripheral resistance and LV meridional end systolic stress were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> for 12weeks improves left ventricular diastolic and systolic function in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
