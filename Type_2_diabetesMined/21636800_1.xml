<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe an etiologic approach to classification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types in youth based on the 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) framework, using data from the SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SEARCH conducted a comprehensive assessment of 2,291 subjects aged &lt;20 years with recently diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> (at least one of two <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> autoantibodies) and insulin sensitivity (equation validated against hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps) as the main etiologic markers, we described four categories along a bidimensional spectrum: autoimmune plus insulin-sensitive (IS), autoimmune plus insulin-resistant (IR), nonautoimmune plus IS, and nonautoimmune plus IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then explored how characteristics, including genetic susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> (HLA genotypes), insulin deficiency, and clinical factors varied across these four categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most subjects fell into either the autoimmune plus IS (54.5%) or nonautoimmune plus IR categories (15.9%) and had characteristics that align with traditional descriptions of type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group classified as autoimmune plus IR (19.5%) had similar prevalence and titers of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> autoantibodies and similar distribution of HLA risk genotypes to those in the autoimmune plus IS group, suggesting that it includes individuals with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group classified as nonautoimmune plus IS (10.1%) likely includes individuals with undetected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> but may also include those with monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and thus requires further testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SEARCH study offers researchers and clinicians a practical application for the etiologic classification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type and at the same time identifies a group of youths who would benefit from further testing </plain></SENT>
