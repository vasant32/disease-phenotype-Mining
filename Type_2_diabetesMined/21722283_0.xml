<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alström syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e>) is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> monogenic disease associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, and alterations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism that often lead to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between weight and metabolism in a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> patients and matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> patients (eight males, seven females; aged 3-51) were compared in a cross-sectional study with an age- and weight-matched control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric parameters, fat mass, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin secretion in basal and dynamic oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) conditions were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, anthropometric and body composition data were obtained from an international group of 27 ALMS patients (13 males, 14 females, age range: 4-29 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> we observed an inverse correlation between age and standard deviation scores for height, weight, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OGTT glycemic curves of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> subjects were similar to those of age-matched controls, whereas insulin response was clearly greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> individuals the insulin response showed a reduction with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We documented pathologic values of the derived indices homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), insulin sensitivity index, HOMA%β-cell and insulinogenic index in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e>, but unlike the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin-resistance</z:hpo> indices, the β-cell function indices showed a significant reduction with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> the progression from the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> toward the impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is mostly because of a progressive failure of β-cell insulin secretion without any further worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with age, even in the presence of weight reduction </plain></SENT>
