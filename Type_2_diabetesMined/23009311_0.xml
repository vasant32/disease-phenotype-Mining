<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An effective hydration of foot skin in diabetics is a relevant preventive strategy in order to maintain a healthy foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">Urea</z:chebi> is considered an effective hydrating and emollient topical product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of topical <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> 5% with arginine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> (Ureadin Rx Db, ISDIN Spain) (UC) in comparison with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-based emollient topical product (Dexeryl, Pierre Fabre) (EC), in Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed the effect of UC on skin hydration in a randomized, evaluator-blinded comparative study in 40 type II diabetic patients, aged 40--75 years, treated with UC or the comparator for 28 days with a twice-daily application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The principal outcomes were the Dryness Area Severity Index (DASI) Score and the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for skin dryness evaluated at baseline and at the end of study period by an investigator unaware of treatment allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UC induced significantly greater hydration than EC with an 89% reduction in DASI score (from 1.6 to 0.2; p &lt; 0.001) in comparison with baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, compared with the control group, DASI score in UC treated group was significantly lower (0.2 vs. 1.0; p = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VAS score (high values mean better hydration) significantly increased in both groups during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VAS score at the end of treatment period was significantly higher in UC group in comparison with EC group (9.8 vs. 8.2; p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Application of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> 5%, arginine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> cream increases skin hydration and alleviates the condition of skin dryness in Type 2 diabetic patients in comparison with a control <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-based emollient product </plain></SENT>
