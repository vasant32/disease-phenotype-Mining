<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A, which is a serum protein produced by the liver and promotes bone mineralization, is an independent risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whilst type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> or fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known how fetuin-A levels relate to parameters of bone metabolism in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Eighty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [40 men and 40 women matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and time since diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>] were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fetuin-A together with metabolic parameters and levels of serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (C-telopeptide), osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP), bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and sex hormones was determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fetuin-A levels did not differ significantly between male and female diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a model adjusted for age, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> index (FLI), time since diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA(1c) , <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drug therapies, smoking, total serum protein, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma glutamyl</z:chebi>-transferase, parathyroid hormone, C-reactive protein, glomerular filtration rate, and presence of micro-, cardio-, and peripheral vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, fetuin-A showed a significant positive association with levels of bone ALP (r = 0·71, P = 0·006) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, fetuin-A was significantly negatively associated with C-telopeptide (r = -0·60, P = 0��03) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest an independent association of fetuin-A levels with markers of bone turnover in male and female patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More studies are needed to determine whether fetuin-A could serve as a new marker for fracture risk or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to explore its potential sexually dimorphic effects </plain></SENT>
