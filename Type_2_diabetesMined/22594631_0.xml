<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we examined (1) the interaction of patients' abstract and concrete beliefs about the timeline of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a predictor of change in adherence to a healthy diet and (2) whether these interactive effects differ among male and female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abstract timeline beliefs were conceptualised as those pertaining to disease duration; concrete timeline beliefs were conceptualised as those pertaining to variability of disease symptoms (i.e. symptoms are stable versus fluctuating) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As predicted, duration beliefs were positively associated with improvement in adherence among patients who viewed disease symptoms as stable, but not among those who viewed symptoms as variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When gender was considered, these interactive effects were observed among male (but not female) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings revealed that the behavioural effects of men's abstract knowledge about their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were conditioned by their concrete representations of the disease, suggesting a bottom-up process of influence with implications for intervention </plain></SENT>
