<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Novel risk factors were either measured in the full cohort or in a case-control sample nested within the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We started with a basic prediction model, previously validated in ARIC, and evaluated 35 novel risk factors by adding them independently to the basic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI) were calculated to determine if each of the novel risk factors improved risk prediction.RESULTSThere were 1,457 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a mean of &gt;7.6 years of follow-up among 12,277 participants at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the novel risk factors significantly improved the AUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forced expiratory volume in 1 s was the only novel risk factor that resulted in a significant NRI (0.54%; 95% CI: 0.33-0.86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin, leptin, Î³-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi> transferase, ferritin, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1, complement C3, white blood cell count, albumin, activated partial thromboplastin time, factor VIII, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, hip circumference, heart rate, and a genetic risk score each significantly improved the IDI, but net changes were small.CONCLUSIONSEvaluation of a large panel of novel risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> indicated only small improvements in risk prediction, which are unlikely to meaningfully alter clinical risk reclassification or discrimination strategies </plain></SENT>
