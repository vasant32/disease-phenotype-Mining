<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is rapidly increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A strong rationale exists for identifying asymptomatic individuals who are at high risk or are likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Screening programs may provide a conduit through which <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> intervention may be targeted towards those who might benefit most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> screening could lessen disease burden in two ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Firstly, by identifying people with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications could be lessened through appropriate management of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondly, by indentifying people at high risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and entering these people into <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programs, the number of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could be reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should ideally involve a non-invasive risk assessment followed by blood testing for those found to be at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that conclusive randomised controlled trial data to support the long-term health and economic impact of screening programs is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The answers surrounding who and how we should screen for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the associated long term benefits will continue to evolve as the evidence base builds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the use of screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> builds in popularity, it is essential that health care systems are sufficiently equipped to effectively manage the newly identified high risk and prevalent cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
