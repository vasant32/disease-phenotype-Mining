<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and clinical and metabolic factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 59 diabetic men aged 50-80 yr who were assessed with bone densitometry (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them, 10.2% of the patients were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in the lumbar spine and 45.8% <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo>, whereas in the femoral neck, 11.8% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and 49% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in the lumbar spine L1-L4 (p=0.004) and in the femoral neck (p=0.036) with iliac artery calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no association with any other metabolic factors, clinical factors, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> evaluated, except for an association between a previous personal history of fractures (p=0.016) and low bone mineral density in the femoral neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found a positive association between the iliac artery calcification and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic male patients </plain></SENT>
