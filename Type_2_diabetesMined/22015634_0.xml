<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 has therapeutic effects in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but its potential is limited by a short half-life, DPP-4 inhibition is a promising approach to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (once-a-day dosing for 8 weeks) effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor PKF-275-055 (1, 3, and 10mg/kg) on β-cell regeneration and plasma DPP-IV activity, intact GLP-1, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load in neonatal wistar rats injected with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) (n2-STZ model), a recognized model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> induced diabetic rats, PKF-275-055 (3, and 10mg/kg) significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion during the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test conducted 2h and 10h after administration, with increases in plasma insulin and active glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) levels and significantly inhibited (&gt; 50% inhibition) plasma DPP-IV activity during both the 1st and 2nd OGTT in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PKF-275-055 (1-10mg/kg) did not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in fasted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PKF-275-055 significantly inhibited advance glycation end product (HbA1c), HOMA-Index, gastric emptying and small intestinal transit rates, with significance at doses of 1mg/kg or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunological staining showed PKF-275-055 stimulates β-cell regeneration and reduces pancreatic cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in diabetic treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present preclinical studies indicate that PKF-275-055 is a novel selective DPP-IV inhibitor with long-acting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect that might be a potential agent for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
