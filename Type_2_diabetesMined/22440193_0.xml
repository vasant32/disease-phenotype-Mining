<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) may reduce in-stent restenosis and improve clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients after bare-metal stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unknown whether diabetic patients with drug-eluting stents (DESs) could benefit from treatment with TZDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of TZDs in type 2 diabetic patients within 1 year of receiving DESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed in 1743 Taiwanese type 2 diabetic patients (1137 men; 606 women) who received DESs between December 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into TZD (n = 268) or non-TZD groups (n = 1,475) using medication records within 3 months of the index hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were available through December 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome measurements included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), and repeat revascularization within 1 year after the index date of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model and other analyses were performed for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the TZD and non-TZD groups, the mean ages were 65.07 and 66.09 years, respectively, for those with limus-eluting stents (LESs) and 65.61 and 65.81 years, respectively, for those with paclitaxel-eluting stents (PESs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With or without TZD medication, there were no significant differences in the adjusted hazard ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI, or repeat revascularization for diabetic patients who received LESs or PESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TZD treatment in patients who received LESs and had a history of MI was associated with a higher risk of MI (hazard ratio = 5.292; 95% CI, 1.028-27.232) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TZDs did not improve the clinical outcomes in Taiwanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients who received DESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TZDs might have been a contributor to higher risk of MI in patients with LESs and a history of MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Larger clinical trials are still needed to study this issue further </plain></SENT>
