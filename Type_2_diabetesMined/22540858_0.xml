<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D), signs of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> with high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> micro- and macro-vascular complications are typical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is estimated from 0.5 to 1% in the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The T2D is the most prevalent type of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (it encompasses more than 85% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the diabetic patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the epidemiology, the coincidence of these two <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subtypes may occur; nevertheless no case reports on the above mentioned two <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subtypes have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was: 1) to perform the DNA analysis in three brothers, two of them with the fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and one with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, and their father with T2D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and 2) to study the coincidence of the GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with T2D and its effect on the diabetic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report about a Roma (Gypsy) family consisting of three brothers: 17 years old probant and two older brothers (21 and 25 years), and their father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probant is suffering from fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>His 25 years old diabetic brother and their father suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The glucokinase gene was analyzed by direct sequencing in each of the brothers and their father, and appropriate phenotype characteristics were also carried out on each of the family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the proband and his diabetic brother with the fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, a heterozygous mutation of the glucokinase gene p.Arg36Trp was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proband's phenotype was consistent with the GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while the diabetic brother displayed already features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although, the latter one suffered from the overweight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, his fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (8.3 mmol/l) was still consistent with the GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Their father is also a heterozygous mutation carrier of the same mutation displaying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In his case, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0008283'>fasting hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> (43.5 Î¼U/ml) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (10.4 mmol/l) are more typical for the T2D than GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found coincidence between the GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and T2D in the members of a single Roma (Gypsy) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications are rare in the GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the major risk factor for the further morbidity may be in the development of the T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The overlapping of the GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with other types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly the T2D, makes the diagnostics difficult and therefore, it might be one of the reasons why the estimated prevalence of the GCK-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seems to be higher than the real one as it has been reported in several studies </plain></SENT>
