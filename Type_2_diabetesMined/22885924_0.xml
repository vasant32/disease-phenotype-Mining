<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loci influencing fasting insulin concentration showed association with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and fat distribution, suggesting impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene-based analyses identified further biologically plausible loci, suggesting that additional loci beyond those reaching genome-wide significance are likely to represent real associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is supported by an excess of directionally consistent and nominally significant signals between discovery and follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of these newly discovered loci will further improve our understanding of glycemic control </plain></SENT>
