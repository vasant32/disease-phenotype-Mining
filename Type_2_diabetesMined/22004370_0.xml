<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying distinct types of smokers within this population could help tailor and target intervention programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether smokers with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could be classified into different profiles based on smoking habits, socio-economic characteristics and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of adults with self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was selected from random-digit dialing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses included 383 participants with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information related to smoking, socio-economic status, health and lifestyle was collected by phone interview at baseline and 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups of smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We uncovered three meaningful classes of smokers: class 1, long-time smokers with long-standing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 105); class 2, heavy smokers with deprived socio-economic status, poor health and unhealthy lifestyle characteristics (n = 105); class 3, working and active smokers who were more recently diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 173) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Members of class 2 were significantly more likely to be disabled and depressed at baseline and 1 year later compared with other classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Different profiles of smokers exist among adults with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, each suggesting different cessation treatment needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing between these types of smokers may enable clinicians to tailor their approach to smoking cessation </plain></SENT>
