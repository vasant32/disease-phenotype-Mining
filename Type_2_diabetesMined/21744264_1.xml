<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relation of Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the adiponectin locus (+45T/G and +276G/T) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic influence of the adiponectin gene polymorphisms in the development of CAD among patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The adiponectin genotypes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis (PCR-RFLP) in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) SNPs (i.e. SNPs +45T&gt;G and +276G&gt;T) were genotyped in 114 Type 2 diabetic subjects with CAD, and 127 Type 2 diabetic patients without CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and anthropometric data along with plasma biochemistry including <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, glycemic indices, and adiponectin were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the distribution of genotypes of +45T/G and +276G/T between CAD and non-CAD individuals (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on our results SNP+276G&gt;T is associated with decreased risk of CAD after adjustment for potential confounding factors [adjusted OR = 0.39 (95%CI: 0.22-0.68); P = 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were not observed for the +45T&gt;G SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two haplotypes 45T-276T and 45G-276T were associated with a decreased risk of CAD [adjusted OR = 0.47 (95% CI: 0.32-0.94); P = 0.03 and adjusted OR = 0.33 (95% CI: 0.13-0.83); P = 0.02 respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between HOMA-IR, BMI, waist circumference, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, HbA1C, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations regarding the two SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these findings suggest that T allele of +276G&gt;T SNP is significantly associated with decreased risk of CAD in T2D Patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also Haplotype analysis showed that two haplotypes 45T-276T and 45G-276T were associated with a decreased risk of CAD </plain></SENT>
