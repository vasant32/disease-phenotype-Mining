<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The increasing health and economic burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has made preventing the disease a public health priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But investing in such <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease prevention programs requires a long-term horizon because many years may be required for the downstream savings to fully offset the up-front intervention cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a simulation model, we projected the costs and benefits of a nationwide community-based lifestyle intervention program for preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accounting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> costs to the US health care system, our results indicate that the program would break even in fourteen years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within twenty-five years, the program would prevent or delay about 885,000 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the United States and produce savings of $5.7 billion nationwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If restricted to people ages 65-84, the program would save $2.4 billion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, implementing such a program nationwide would be an efficient use of health care resources, although it might be necessary for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> health insurers to participate to share prevention costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results also indicate that although a prevention program would lead to cost savings in both younger and older people, it would achieve greater health and economic gains if it were directed at people under age sixty-five </plain></SENT>
