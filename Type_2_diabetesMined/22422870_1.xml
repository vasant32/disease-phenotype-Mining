<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To summarise evidence on the association between white rice consumption and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to quantify the potential dose-response relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Searches of Medline and Embase databases for articles published up to January 2012 using keywords that included both rice intake and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; further searches of references of included original studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Included studies were prospective cohort studies that reported risk estimates for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by rice intake levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: Relative risks were pooled using a random effects model; dose-response relations were evaluated using data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rice intake categories in each study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four articles were identified that included seven distinct prospective cohort analyses in Asian and Western populations for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 13,284 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were ascertained among 352,384 participants with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 22 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Asian (Chinese and Japanese) populations had much higher white rice consumption levels than did Western populations (average intake levels were three to four servings/day versus one to two servings/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pooled relative risk was 1.55 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.01) comparing the highest with the lowest category of white rice intake in Asian populations, whereas the corresponding relative risk was 1.12 (0.94 to 1.33) in Western populations (P for interaction=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the total population, the dose-response meta-analysis indicated that for each serving per day increment of white rice intake, the relative risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.11 (1.08 to 1.14) (P for linear trend&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher consumption of white rice is associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially in Asian (Chinese and Japanese) populations </plain></SENT>
