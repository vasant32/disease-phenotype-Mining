<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> is a second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> that stimulates pancreatic β cells to release insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, is has been shown to work via several extra pancreatic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is administered as monotherapy in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in whom glycemic control is not achieved by dietary and lifestyle modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It can also be combined with other antihyperglycemic agents, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and insulin, in patients who are not adequately controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
