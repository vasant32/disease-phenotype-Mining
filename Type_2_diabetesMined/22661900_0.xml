<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the data supporting the use of vildagliptin in monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consideration based on baseline glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and age is given to patient segments where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is not appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> is not an indication, this manuscript briefly reviews some of the existing data showing that the mechanisms at work in diabetic populations are active in patients currently classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the rationale for vildagliptin dosing frequency in monotherapy is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, this review aims to define where in community practice the use of vildagliptin as monotherapy is most desirable, focusing on segments of the population with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> that might receive the greatest benefit from vildagliptin in the management of their disease </plain></SENT>
