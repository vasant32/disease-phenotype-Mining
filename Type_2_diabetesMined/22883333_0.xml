<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 130 hospitalized elderly type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our hospital were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires and other related clinical data were collected within one week after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: poor-sleeper group and good-sleeper group according to Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty percent (78/130) of these patients were poor sleepers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following parameters differed in the two groups: the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [(7.9 ± 1.8) years vs (7.2 ± 1.5) years, t = 2.318], systolic blood pressure [(148 ± 30) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) vs (138 ± 23) mm Hg, t = 2.037], fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) [(10.7 ± 2.2) mmol/L vs (9.8 ± 1.9) mmol/L, t = 2.410], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) [(8.6 ± 2.2)% vs (7.8 ± 2.1)%, t = 2.068], high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) [(5.27 ± 2.34) mg/L vs (4.44 ± 1.76) mg/L, t = 2.179], ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> (61% vs 32%, χ(2) = 4.257), percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (20% vs 8%, χ(2) = 3.722), score of life quality [(98 ± 19) scores vs (89 ± 13) scores, t = 2.980], and proportion of patients treated with insulin (32% vs 12%, χ(2) = 4.489) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the above parameters were significantly higher in poor-sleeper group than the good-sleeper group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P value &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple correlation analysis showed that the factors affecting sleep quality were FPG, HbA1c, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, life quality and insulin application (r = 0.213, 0.257, 0.223, 0.335, 0.422, 0.3451, 0.231, respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P value &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the followings were found: FPG (β = 1.29, P &lt; 0.05) and PSQI (β = 1.07, P &lt; 0.05) were found to be correlated with HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With increasing of PSQI, FPG, HbA1c, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> and life quality were changed significantly (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P value &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The independent risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> were duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.01 - 2.01), HbA1c (OR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.63 - 2.67), hs-CRP (OR = 1.12, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.21) and PSQI (OR = 1.71, 95%CI 1.58 - 2.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are usually poor sleepers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sleep quality probably affects blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation, and is closely correlated with the occurrence of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, poor sleep quality results in poor life quality </plain></SENT>
