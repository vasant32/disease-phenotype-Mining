<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty-three Hispanics with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their family members/significant others were recruited in the southeastern United States for a family-based intervention study on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focus groups were conducted in which participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and family members were asked to describe their perceptions of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sessions were audiotaped and transcribed, translated from Spanish into English, and analyzed using standard content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article reports the findings as well as demographic information and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1C levels of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The meaning of insulin was described by both Hispanic immigrants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their family members/significant others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants' perceptions were categorized into three major themes: (1) negative perceptions of insulin therapy, (2) perceived barriers to insulin therapy, and (3) positive experiences with insulin emerged from qualitative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Hispanic immigrants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their family members/significant others in this study described perceptions and fears of insulin indicating a lack of understanding of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> disease process and the progressive nature of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strategies and further research are necessary to dispel negative perceptions and facilitate positive experiences with insulin for patients and family members/significant others </plain></SENT>
