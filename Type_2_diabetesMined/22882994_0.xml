<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate possible associations of the variants in genes encoding organic cationic transporters (SLC22A1, SLC22A2 and SLC47A1) with response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>148 drug-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping for SLC22A1 rs622342, SLC22A2 rs316019 and SLC47A1 rs2289669 variants was done using real-time PCR with subsequent melting-curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLC47A1 rs2289669 genotype was significantly associated with the reduction in HbA(1c) after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>20% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that are homozygous for A-allele of SLC47A1 had twofold reduction in HbA(1c) in comparison with the patients carrying G-allele (GG+GA: 0.55±0.09% vs. AA: 1.10±0.18%, p=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of the present study might have in future practical implication in personalised treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
