<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (HHC) disrupts vascular structure and function, no matter the underlying causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> is greater in diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> than in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homocystein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate whether there are differences of homocystein levels in dipper and non-dippers patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We compared 50 patien-ts (33 females, 17 males) with type 2 DM and 35 healthy individuals (18 females, 17 males ) in a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the percentage of non-dipper pattern was 72% in patients with type 2 DM and 57% in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In diabetic and control individuals, homocystein levels were higher in non-dipper (respectively 13.4 ± 8.1 µmol/L and 11.8 ± 5 µmol/L) than in dipper subjects (respectively, 11.8 ± 5.8 µmol/L and 10.1 ± 4.2 µmol/L), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (respectively, p = 0.545, p = 0.294) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In both groups, homocystein levels were higher in non-dipper than in dipper participants, but there was no significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High homocystein levels and the non-dipper pattern increases cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the relationship between nocturnal blood pressure changes and homocystein levels should be investigated in a larger study </plain></SENT>
