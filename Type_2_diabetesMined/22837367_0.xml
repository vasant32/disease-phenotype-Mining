<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GFR was estimated using the four-variable Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> (MDRD) study equation and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kidney Disease</z:e> Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.RESULTSAt baseline, an estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m(2) was present in 22.0 and 20.2% of patients using the MDRD study equation and the CKD-EPI equation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 309 patients died during the follow-up (152 patients from cardiovascular causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>-based equations were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the CKD-EPI equation provided a more accurate risk prediction of mortality than the MDRD study equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiving operating characteristic curves showed that the areas under the curve (AUCs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (AUC 0.712 [95% CI 0.682-0.741]) and cardiovascular mortality (0.771 [0.734-0.808]) using eGFR(CKD-EPI) were significantly greater (P &lt; 0.0001 by the z statistic) than those obtained by using eGFR(MDRD) (0.679 [0.647-0.711] for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and 0.739 [0.698-0.783] for cardiovascular mortality).CONCLUSIONSOur findings suggest that the estimation of GFR using the CKD-EPI equation more appropriately stratifies patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with the MDRD study equation </plain></SENT>
