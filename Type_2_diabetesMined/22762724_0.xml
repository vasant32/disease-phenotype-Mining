<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: One of the recent treatment strategies is using activators of SIRT1, which has been in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many of the cellular processes including insulin secretion, cell cycle, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are imperatively regulated by a family of mediators called sirtuins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First known mammalian sirtuin, SIRT1 is a positive regulator of insulin secretion, which triggers <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>Since the past decade, a major outstanding question is whether SIRT1 activation is a safe therapy for human diseases such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes and discusses the advances of the past decade and the challenges that will brazen out perplexity about homeostasis and metabolic pathways linked to SIRT1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we described the interlink between SIRT1 metabolic pathways of various tissues such as pancreas, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: However be the complexity of the pathways involved, T2DM regulated by SIRT1 affected metabolism is dropping down progressively due to profound research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the context of interlinking <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the SIRT1 pathways in T2DM we found various crucial intermediaries in metabolic tissues, which can also be targeted for future prospects </plain></SENT>
