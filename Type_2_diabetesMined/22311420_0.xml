<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise reduces HbA(1c) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, short-term exercise improves measures of insulin sensitivity but does not consistently alter responses to the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether short-term exercise training improves <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> and glycaemic control in free-living patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independently of the changes in fitness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and energy balance often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitors, <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> was quantified in previously sedentary patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not using exogenous insulin (n = 13, age 53 ± 2 years, HbA(1c) 6.6 ± 0.2% (49.1 ± 1.9 mmol/mol)) during 3 days of habitual activity and during the final 3 days of a 7 day aerobic exercise training programme (7D-EX) which does not elicit measurable changes in cardiorespiratory fitness or body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diet was standardised across monitoring periods, with modifications during 7D-EX to offset increases in energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OGTTs were performed on the morning following each monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 7D-EX attenuated <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) as well as the frequency, magnitude and duration of glycaemic excursions (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, average 24 h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not change, nor did <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses to the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: 7D-EX attenuated glycaemic variability and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> in free-living patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but did not significantly alter responses to the laboratory-based OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects appeared to be independent of changes in fitness, body composition or energy balance </plain></SENT>
