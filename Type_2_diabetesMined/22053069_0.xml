<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recommendations are for youth to attain at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity (PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fewer than 20% achieve this goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examines differences between blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and PA in youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A1c levels and PA were tested in youth 9 to 17 years old with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during clinic visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in MVPA were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Slightly more than half of youth had well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> engaged in less PA than recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Youth with well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> engaged in slightly less MVPA than those whose <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not in control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in minutes of MVPA by gender, race, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to identify ways to increase PA among youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
