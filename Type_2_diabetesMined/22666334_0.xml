<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In previous meta-analyses, tea consumption has been associated with lower incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear, however, if tea is associated inversely over the entire range of intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the association between tea consumption and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a European population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The EPIC-InterAct case-cohort study was conducted in 26 centers in 8 European countries and consists of a total of 12,403 incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and a stratified subcohort of 16,835 individuals from a total cohort of 340,234 participants with 3.99 million person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Country-specific Hazard Ratios (HR) for incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were obtained after adjustment for lifestyle and dietary factors using a Cox regression adapted for a case-cohort design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, country-specific HR were combined using a random effects meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tea consumption was studied as categorical variable (0, &gt;0-&lt;1, 1-&lt;4, ≥ 4 cups/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dose-response of the association was further explored by restricted cubic spline regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Country specific medians of tea consumption ranged from 0 cups/day in Spain to 4 cups/day in United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tea consumption was associated inversely with incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; the HR was 0.84 [95%CI 0.71, 1.00] when participants who drank ≥ 4 cups of tea per day were compared with non-drinkers (p(linear trend) = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> already tended to be lower with tea consumption of 1-&lt;4 cups/day (HR = 0.93 [95%CI 0.81, 1.05]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spline regression did not suggest a non-linear association (p(non-linearity) = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A linear inverse association was observed between tea consumption and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>People who drink at least 4 cups of tea per day may have a 16% lower risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than non-tea drinkers </plain></SENT>
