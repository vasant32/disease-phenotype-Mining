<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We collected alveolar bone chips under aseptic conditions and cultured them in vitro using the tissue explants adherent method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biological properties of these cells were characterized using the following methods: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) chemical staining for cell viability, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16866">Alizarin red</z:chebi> staining for osteogenic characteristics, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> test for cell proliferation, enzyme dynamics for ALP contents, radio-immunoassay for bone gla protein (BGP) concentration, and ELISA for the concentration of type I collagen (COL-I) in the supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we detected the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> ability of two types of cells from <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> slices using non-specific immunofluorescence staining and cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two cell forms showed no significant difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> under the same culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the alveolar bone osteoblasts received from type 2 diabetic patients had slower growth, lower cell activity and calcium nodule formation than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of ALP, BGP and COL-I was lower in the supernatant of alveolar bone osteoblasts received from type 2 diabetic patients than in that received from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alveolar bone osteoblasts obtained from type 2 diabetic patients can be successfully cultured in vitro with the same <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and biological characteristics as those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients, but with slower growth and lower concentration of specific secretion and lower combining ability with <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ones </plain></SENT>
