<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The number of people suffering from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is hastily increasing and the condition is associated with altered brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> is located in astrocytes and being a carbohydrate reservoir it contributes to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> has been indicated to be important for proper neurotransmission under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous findings from our laboratory suggested that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was reduced in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and thus we wanted to investigate more specifically how brain <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> metabolism contributes to maintain energy status in the type 2 diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, our objective was to elucidate the contribution of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> to support neurotransmitter <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> phosphorylase (GP) inhibitor was administered to Sprague-Dawley (SprD) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats in vivo and after one day of treatment [1-¹³C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was used to monitor metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain levels of ¹³C labeling in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, alanine, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>, glutamine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that inhibition of brain <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> metabolism reduced the amounts of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in both the control and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was associated with a decrease in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase ratio in the control but not the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> levels were increased suggesting that brain <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> serves a role in maintaining a proper ratio between excitatory and inhibitory <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both the control and the type 2 diabetic states had a compensatory increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-derived ¹³C processed through the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle following inhibition of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, it was indicated that the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model might have an augmented necessity for compensatory upregulation at the glycolytic level </plain></SENT>
