<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Minorities are disproportionately affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and data suggest that clinical outcomes consistently fall below American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this systematic review was to examine ethnic differences in self-monitoring and outcomes in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medline was searched for articles published between January 1990 and January 2012 by means of a reproducible strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria included (1) published in English, (2) targeted African Americans, Hispanic, or Asian adults, ages 18+ years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, (3) cross-sectional, cohort, or intervention study, and (4) measured change in glycemic control, BP, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, or quality of life by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two papers met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, significant racial differences and barriers were found in published studies in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management as it pertains to self-monitoring and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>African Americans tend to consistently exhibit worse outcomes and control when compared to other minority populations and non-Hispanic Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, significant racial differences and barriers exist in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management as it pertains to self-monitoring and outcomes when compared to non-Hispanic Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Explanatory and intervention studies are needed to determine the mechanisms and mediators of these differences and strategies to reduce these disparities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, more research is needed to investigate the impact of racial differences in self-monitoring and outcomes on quality of life </plain></SENT>
