<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The global <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic has led to dramatic increases in the incidence and prevalence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) among youth worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In today's clinical practice it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T1DM) from T2DM as many children with T1DM are overweight at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous recent publications note a significant proportion of physician-diagnosed T2DM youth with evidence of pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, exemplifying the challenges in distinguishing between T1DM and T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications of the phenomenon of antibody positivity in phenotypic T2DM youth, also referred to as "type 1.5 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>" (T1.5 DM), "double <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>," "latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth" (LADY), and "hybrid <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>," are unclear at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current and future work should determine if the presence of autoantibodies in phenotypic T2DM youth/children affects clinical course; this will facilitate the development of optimal treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
