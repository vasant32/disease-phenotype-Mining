<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether this form of exercise therapy leads to clinically meaningful changes in metabolic, cardiovascular and anthropometric parameters in Asian Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The study was designed to investigate the efficacy of progressive resistance training on glycemic, musculoskeletal, anthropometric and cardiovascular variables in untrained middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients living in North India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight untrained patients, 35 men and 13 women (mean ± SD age, 44.7 ± 4.2 years), with a diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly divided into 2 groups: A group receiving progressive resistance training and a control group who provided participative involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes were glycemic control and muscle strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, anthropometric and cardiovascular risk parameters were evaluated at baseline and after intervention or control program at 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mixed ANOVA revealed a significant group-by-time interaction for the main outcomes of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Change in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was mean ± SD, 0.6 ± 0.5 in progressive resistance training group compared to no change in control group (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progressive resistance training group showed a greater improvement in upper and lower body muscle strength (P &lt; .001), waist circumference (P = .008), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no significant group-by-time interaction was detected on body weight, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A short-term progressive resistance training program leads to clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control and muscle strength in untrained middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients of Asian Indian ethnicity </plain></SENT>
