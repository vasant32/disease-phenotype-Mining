<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictors of progression of calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the effect of intensive glycemic control on this process in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: As part of the Risk Factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and Clinical Events in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (RACED) substudy of the Veterans Affairs <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Trial (VADT), 197 and 189 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received baseline and follow-up computed tomographic scans for measurement of coronary and abdominal artery calcium, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard and novel risk factors were assessed at baseline, and progression of calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was determined by several methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression was defined both as a categorical (square root increase of volumetric scores â‰¥ 2.5 mm(3)) and continuous variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, annualized percent change of volume scores was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After an average follow-up of 4.6 years, &gt;75% of individuals demonstrated coronary (CAC) and abdominal artery calcification (AAC) progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression increased with higher baseline calcium categories but was not influenced by standard risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) (P = 0.02) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2)) (P = 0.01) predicted progression of CAC, and these results were not altered by adjustment for age and other traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment assignment (intensive versus standard) within the VADT did not influence CAC or AAC progression, irrespective of baseline calcium category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with long-standing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, baseline CAC, Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2), and ACR predicted progression of CAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intensive glycemic control during the VADT did not reduce progression of calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
