<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified that variants in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR-Î´ (PPARD), a target gene of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, were significantly associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin sensitivity in European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This current study sought to determine (1) whether the genetic associations of PPARD variants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its related traits could be replicated in Chinese Han population, and (2) whether the associations would be modified by the effect of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: We genotyped 9 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cover the gene of PPARD (rs2267664, rs6902123, rs3798343, rs2267665, rs2267668, rs2016520, rs2299869, rs1053049, and rs9658056) and tested their associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and its related traits, including fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and HbA1c in 3,210 Chinese Hans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 9 PPARD tag SNPs, rs6902123 was significantly associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.75 [95%CI 1.22-2.53]; P = 0.0025) and combined type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) (odds ratio 1.47 [95%CI 1.12-1.92]; P = 0.0054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The minor C allele of rs6902123 was associated with increased levels of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.0316) and HbA1c (P = 0.0180) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> modified the effect of rs6902123 on HbA1c (P for interaction = 0.0347) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate that common variants in PPARD contribute to the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese Hans, and provided suggestive evidence of interaction between 25(OH)D levels and PPARD-rs6902123 on HbA1c </plain></SENT>
