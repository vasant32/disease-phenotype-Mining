<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the strength of association of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> with the oral inflammatory burden, as assessed by markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in saliva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 192 subjects with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>. β-glucuronidase (βG) was measured via a fluorometric array and interlukin-1β (IL-1β) via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentration of both mediators was evaluated in relationship to clinical parameters, severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regression analysis demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> was independently and positively correlated with increased concentration of βG in saliva (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the relative association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> with the level of βG in saliva was greater than the strength of association of the diabetic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-1β concentration in saliva was primarily associated with the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01), but not the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the nature of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in the oral cavity as assessed by inflammatory markers in saliva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were independently associated with the oral inflammatory burden, in which the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> was more pronounced </plain></SENT>
