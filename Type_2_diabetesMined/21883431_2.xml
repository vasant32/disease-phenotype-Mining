<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6.3% (95% confidence interval: 5.7-7.0%), higher in men (9.1%) than in women (3.8%, P &lt; 0.001) and increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds (65.3%; 60.4-70.0%) of participants with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were aware of their status and among those aware 86.0% (81.5-90.3%) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was more frequent in men (91.3%) than in women (75.9%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of those treated for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were on monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">Biguanides</z:chebi> were prescribed in 65.0% of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and represented 48% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among participants presenting with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, increasing age was positively associated with awareness of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
