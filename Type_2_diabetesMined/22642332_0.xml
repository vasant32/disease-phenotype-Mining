<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Preparations of either Gordonia bronchialis, Tsukamurella inchonensis or a saline placebo were given by three subcutaneous injections, 30 days apart, starting when rats were aged 120 days, just before development of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and at day 440, when the disease was well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bodyweight, blood sugar, cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and insulin levels were measured to determine the effects and at the end of the experiments, animals were subjected to necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The development of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was prevented by both reagents, most effectively by T. inchonensis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the treatment experiment, the effects of the disease were reduced by both treatments, markedly so by T. inchonensis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both experiments <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was reduced in treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms of action are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in the studied rats is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and that both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> can be prevented or improved by treatment with Actinomycetales immune modulators </plain></SENT>
