<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bootstrapping was used to determine whether there was an indirect effect of SMBG on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> through diet adherence and an indirect effect of SMBG on A1C through <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>.RESULTS: The relationship between increased SMBG and greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was mediated by better adherence to diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship of increased SMBG and greater reductions in A1C were mediated by greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>.CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study were consistent with the hypothesis that SMBG leads to an increased adherence to dietary recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For patients who are taught to use their diet to lose weight, increased adherence to dietary recommendations is associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and subsequently better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SMBG may be of value as an adjunctive intervention in behavioral programs for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
