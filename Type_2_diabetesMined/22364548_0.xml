<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Type 2 idiopathic macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (MacTel) is a progressive <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> disease associated with a slow deterioration of visual acuity, starting in the fifth to seventh decades of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology and pathogenesis of the disease are little known, and no effective therapy is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to estimate the prevalence and describe the phenotype of type 2 MacTel in two African populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From two population-based cross-sectional surveys conducted nationally in Nigeria and in the Nakuru district of Kenya, patients with fundus features of type 2 MacTel were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on color fundus images, grading performed according to the MacTel Study protocol and staged using the Gass and Blodi system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease phenotype and clinical characteristics of affected participants were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 8599 total participants, five showed a phenotype compatible with type 2 MacTel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was estimated as 0.06% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.21%) in Kenya, 0.06% (95% CI 0.01-0.17%) in Nigeria, and overall at 0.06% (95% CI 0.02-0.14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 62 years (SD 5 years), four of five affected participants were female, and none had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median corrected visual acuity was 6/12 in the better eye and 6/69 in the worse eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The estimated prevalence and phenotype of type 2 MacTel in the African populations examined were similar to those in predominantly white populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data published so far are based on the analysis of color fundus images only and are thus likely to underestimate the true prevalence of this disease </plain></SENT>
