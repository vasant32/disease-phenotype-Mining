<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the gastric emptying time in people with newly detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before and after control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gastric emptying to solid meal was studied in 30 asymptomatic women with newly detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before and after achieving euglycemia and compared with 20 healthy age, sex and weight matched controls using egg white labelled with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi> 99m <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">Sulfur</z:chebi> Colloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>Delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> was seen in 90% of women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and none in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lag phase was 83.1±11.8min in cases compared to 37.2±4.0 in controls (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastric emptying at 4h was 46.73%±4.84% in cases and 97.65%±0.59% in controls (p=0.05).T50 was 250±8.8min in cases against 94.70±5.10min in controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, lag phase normalized to 37.2±4.0min against 35.2±4.6min in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other parameters also normalized after control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>Delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> to solids was seen in 90% of women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and normalized after control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
