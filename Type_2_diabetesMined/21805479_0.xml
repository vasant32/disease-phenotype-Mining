<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies suggested complicated associations between type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a significant inverse association between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) and the risk and mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> could be modified in various ways in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, and this may lead to the altered effects on many different types of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our study, we found that glycation and oxidation levels are significantly higher in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> from type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients compared to that from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> dramatically had a stronger capability to promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (as examined both on hormone-independent cells and on hormone-dependent cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, glycated and oxidized <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, which were produced in vitro, acted in similar way as diabetic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and oxidized <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> also induced higher synthesis and secretion of VEGF-C, MMP-2 and MMP-9 from malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>)-MB-231 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was indicated that diabetic, glycated and oxidized <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> promote <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 cell migration and invasion through ERK and p38 MAPK pathways, and Akt pathway plays an important role as well in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 cell invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Akt, ERK and p38 MAPK pathways are also involved in VEGF-C and MMP-9 secretion induced by diabetic, glycated and oxidized <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that glycation and oxidation of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> in diabetic patients could lead to abnormal actions on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 cell proliferation, migration and invasion, thereby promoting the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This will largely draw the attention of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-based treatments in diabetic patients especially those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
