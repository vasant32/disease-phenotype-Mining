<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the change in urinary albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio in relation to the season in Japanese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 430 subjects (275 male, 155 female) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (defined by UACR 30-300 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One year was divided into four seasons and each season was defined as winter (December-February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and fall (September-November), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels, and the urinary albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated glomerular filtration rate was also calculated and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age (± SE) was 64.8 ± 0.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in winter than in summer (136 ± 0.68 vs. 133 ± 0.68 mmHg, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The urinary albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio showed a significantly higher value in winter than in summer (72.8 ± 4.4 vs. 54.6 ± 3.4 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The curve of seasonal variation of this ratio showed a similar change to that of systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant seasonal variation was observed in estimated glomerular filtration rate and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there is a hitherto unknown seasonal variation in the urinary albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, and that it may be necessary to consider this seasonal change, especially when performing an intervention study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
