<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported previously that an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor blocker, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>, improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ activation; however, the detailed mechanisms are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enhanced blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability with alteration of tight junctions is suggested to be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the possibility that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> could attenuate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> impairment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ activation to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic mice KKA(y) exhibited impairment of cognitive function, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment attenuated this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cotreatment with GW9662, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, interfered with these protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> against cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was increased in both the cortex and hippocampus in KKA(y) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> attenuated this increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coadministration of GW9662 reduced this effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant decreases in expression of tight junction proteins and increases in matrix metalloproteinase expression, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and proinflammatory cytokine production were observed in the brain, and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> restored these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Swollen astroglial end-feet in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> were observed in KKA(y) mice, and this change in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> ultrastructure was decreased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> were weakened by cotreatment with GW9662 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, administration of another <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor blocker, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, was less effective compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> in terms of preventing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and astroglial end-foot swelling, and coadministration of GW9662 did not affect the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the possibility that, in type 2 diabetic mice, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor blockade with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ activation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> may help with protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> by preserving the integrity of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
