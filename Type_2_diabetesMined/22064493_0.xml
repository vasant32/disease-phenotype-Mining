<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the past three decades, the number of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> has more than doubled globally, making it one of the most important public health challenges to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> are increasingly observed among children, adolescents and younger adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The causes of the epidemic of T2DM are embedded in a very complex group of genetic and epigenetic systems interacting within an equally complex societal framework that determines behavior and environmental influences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This complexity is reflected in the diverse topics discussed in this Review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the past few years considerable emphasis has been placed on the effect of the intrauterine environment in the epidemic of T2DM, particularly in the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of T2DM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevention of T2DM is a 'whole-of-life' task and requires an integrated approach operating from the origin of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future research is necessary to better understand the potential role of remaining factors, such as genetic predisposition and maternal environment, to help shape prevention programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The potential effect on global <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> surveillance of using HbA(1c) rather than <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values in the diagnosis of T2DM is also discussed </plain></SENT>
