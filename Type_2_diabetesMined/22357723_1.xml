<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Data from mechanistic studies support a beneficial effect of specific <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> on insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have evaluated the relation between intakes of different <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> subclasses and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate whether dietary intakes of major <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> subclasses (ie, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28802">flavonols</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42491">flavones</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5070">flavanones</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38691">flavan</z:chebi>-3-ols, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35218,38697">anthocyanins</z:chebi>) are associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in US adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We followed up a total of 70,359 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1984-2008), 89,201 women in the NHS II (1991-2007), and 41,334 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2006) who were free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 3,645,585 person-years of follow-up, we documented 12,611 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher intakes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35218,38697">anthocyanins</z:chebi> were significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (pooled HR for the 3 cohorts from a comparison of extreme quintiles: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.91; P-trend &lt; 0.001) after multivariate adjustment for age, BMI, and lifestyle and dietary factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consumption of anthocyanin-rich foods, particularly blueberries (pooled HR: 0.77 from a comparison of ≥2 servings/wk with &lt;1 serving/mo; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.87; P-trend &lt; 0.001) and apples/pears (pooled HR: 0.77 from a comparison of ≥5 servings/wk with &lt;1 serving/mo; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.83; P-trend &lt; 0.001), was also associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found for total <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> intake or other <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A higher consumption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35218,38697">anthocyanins</z:chebi> and anthocyanin-rich fruit was associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
