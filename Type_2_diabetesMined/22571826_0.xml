<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively examined the association between vegetable and fruit intake and the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 21 269 men and 27 168 women aged 45-75 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study and had no history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or other serious diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intake of vegetables and fruit was estimated using a validated 147-item FFQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OR of self-reported, physician-diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 5 years was estimated using multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 896 newly diagnosed cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were self-reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intake of vegetables and fruit combined or fruit only was not associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was an approximately 20 %, albeit not statistically significant, risk reduction associated with vegetables (men only), green leafy vegetables (men and women) and cruciferous vegetables (men only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such risk reduction was somewhat greater among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or smoking men than non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or non-smoking men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although a small beneficial effect of vegetables, especially green leafy and cruciferous vegetables, cannot be excluded, vegetable and fruit intake may not be appreciably associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for Japanese adults </plain></SENT>
