<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>POPs are persistent in the environment worldwide and have potential adverse impacts on human health and the environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> (PCDDs), polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28145">dibenzofurans</z:chebi> (PCDFs), and polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="22888">biphenyls</z:chebi> (PCBs) are well known chemicals that are considered as POPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between high-level exposure to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Air Force veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-<z:chebi fb="44" ids="28119">dioxin</z:chebi> (TCDD) during the Vietnam War was reported in the late 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association has been supported by similar epidemiologic studies, whose subjects were exposed to high doses of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> in their places of work involving phenoxyacid <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicide</z:chebi> production and spraying, and in the industrial accident in Seveso, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently, low-level exposure to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> and PCBs has been reported to be linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional studies in the U.S. general population and Japanese general population showed that body burden levels of some <z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> and PCBs were strongly associated with the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Very recently, following these cross-sectional studies, several prospective studies have suggested that low-level exposure to some PCBs predicted the future risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Environmental exposure to some <z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> and PCBs, which mainly accumulate in adipose tissue, may play a role in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
