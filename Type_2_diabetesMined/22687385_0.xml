<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: At the recent consensus conference on autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e>) in Honolulu, we presented preliminary data from our study of surgically treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly supported the separation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> into type 1 and type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study is based on a total of 114 surgically treated European <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to elucidate serum IgG4 elevation, other organ involvement, relapse of disease, steroid treatment and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after surgery in 114 surgically treated European <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 88 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 22 left-sided resections and 4 total pancreatectomies were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were graded for granulocytic epithelial lesions, IgG4-positive cells, storiform <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> and eosinophilic granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were obtained from 102/114 patients, mean follow-up was 5.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histologically, 63 (55.3%) of the 114 patients fulfilled the criteria of type 1 AIP, while 51 (44.7%) patients fulfilled the criteria of type 2 AIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 1 AIP patients were older and more often males than type 2 AIP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevation of serum IgG4, involvement of extrapancreatic organs, disease relapse, systemic steroid treatment and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after surgery were noted more often in type 1 AIP, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) was observed mainly in type 2 AIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Histological typing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> is clinically important because type 1 AIP is part of the IgG4-related disease and type 2 AIP is associated with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data also show that relapse of disease and steroid treatment after surgery occur more frequently in type 1 than in type 2 AIP </plain></SENT>
