<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although Akt/endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation is known to be negatively regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), it is unclear whether the GRK2 inhibitor would have therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examined the hypotensive effect of the GRK2 inhibitor and its efficacy <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> both vascular (aortic) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> (focusing especially on the Akt/eNOS pathway) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in two type 2 diabetic models (ob/ob mice and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were treated with a single injection of the GRK2 inhibitor or vehicle, and the therapeutic effects were compared by examining vascular function and by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GRK2 inhibitor lowered blood pressure in both diabetic models but not in their age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GRK2 inhibitor significantly improved <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi>-induced relaxation only in diabetic (ob/ob and DM) mice, with accompanying attenuations of GRK2 activity and translocation to the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These protective effects of the GRK2 inhibitor may be attributable to the augmented Akt/eNOS pathway activation (as evidenced by increases in Akt phosphorylation at Ser(473) and at Thr(308), and eNOS phosphorylation at Ser(1177)) and to the prevention of the GRK2 translocation and promotion of β-arrestin 2 translocation to the membrane under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the GRK2 inhibitor significantly improved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> seen in the ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our work provides the first evidence that in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the GRK2 inhibitor ameliorates vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> via the Akt/eNOS pathway by inhibiting GRK2 activity and enhancing β-arrestin 2 translocation under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> stimulation, thereby contributing to a blood pressure-lowering effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the GRK2 inhibitor may be a promising therapeutic agent for cardiovascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
