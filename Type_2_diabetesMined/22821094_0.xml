<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 10-year observational cohort study investigated 969 men and 585 women (23 to 80 years of age), who underwent voluntary complete medical check-ups and an annual 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (75 g-OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥126 mg/dL, 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level in a 75 g-OGTT ≥200 mg/dL and/or received medical treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the previous year were considered as new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the independent contribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> to the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with Cox proportional hazard model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: During the follow-up period, we diagnosed 86 men and 49 women with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Cox proportional hazards model, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> increased with increasing BMI, even after adjusting for age, sex, blood pressure, metabolic profiles, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the final model, setting BMI less than 25 as a reference group, the Hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was 3.12 for those with a BMI of 25-27.4 and it was increased to 3.80 for participants with a BMI of 27.5 or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (high BMI) is an independent and dose-dependent risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in overweight Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results confirmed the usefulness of BMI as a classic parameter, and the importance of lifestyle modification and better management among people with overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> for prevention of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
