<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the EU, saxagliptin is indicated as combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, a thiazolidinedione, or insulin (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including those with mild to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of add-on saxagliptin therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in line with its approved indications in the EU, and summarizes the drug's pharmacological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical efficacy of saxagliptin 5 mg/day in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>), a thiazolidinedione, or insulin (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) has been demonstrated in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III trials (18-104 weeks in duration) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these trials, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) was changed from baseline (primary endpoint) by a greater extent with add-on saxagliptin 5 mg/day (-1.09% to +0.03%) than with comparator regimens (-0.44% to +0.69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two other randomized, double-blind trials showed that saxagliptin 5 mg/day as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was noninferior to uptitrated glipizide in terms of lowering HbA(1c) (-0.74% vs -0.80%) at 52 weeks, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (-0.52% vs -0.62%) at 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin 2.5 mg/day as add-on to existing anti-diabetic therapy was also effective for up to 52 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (HbA(1c) was reduced by 1.08% vs 0.36%; p ≤ 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin as add-on therapy for up to 4 years was generally well tolerated in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with saxagliptin did not increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or cardiovascular outcomes relative to placebo or active comparators, and was generally weight neutral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, saxagliptin is a useful option as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, a thiazolidinedione, or insulin (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who require combination therapy </plain></SENT>
