<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate whether endothelial function could be a determinant of arterial stiffness in essential hypertensive patients, in relation with the concomitant presence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 341 participants (84 hypertensive patients with and 175 without type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 82 matched controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brachial artery endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was determined by high-resolution ultrasound and computerised edge detection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Applanation tonometry was used to measure carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hypertensive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had higher PWV (10.1 ± 2.3 m/s vs 8.6 ± 1.4 m/s, p &lt; 0.001) and lower FMD (3.51 ± 2.07 vs 5.16 ± 2.96%, p &lt; 0.001) than non-diabetic hypertensive patients, who showed impaired vascular function when compared with healthy participants (7.9 ± 1.6 m/s and 6.68 ± 3.67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FMD was significantly and negatively correlated to PWV only in hypertensive diabetic patients (r = -0.456, p &lt; 0.001), but not in hypertensive normoglycaemic patients (r = -0.088, p = 0.248) or in healthy participants (r = 0.008, p = 0.946) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, in the diabetic group, FMD remained an independent predictor of PWV after adjustment for confounders (r(2) = 0.083, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis performed in non-diabetic hypertensive patients revealed that neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> nor the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> affected the relationship between FMD and PWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is a determinant of aortic stiffness in hypertensive diabetic patients but not in hypertensive patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on top of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> might worsen arterial compliance by endothelium-related mechanisms </plain></SENT>
