<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> plays an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> from the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> to plaque formation to final rupture of the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the potential pathophysiological and clinical relevance of novel cytokines secreted from various cells including adipocytes, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells, in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in asymptomatic subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled a total of 70 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without a documented history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and determined serum levels of chemerin, omentin-1, YKL-40, and sCD26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, and defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> ≥ 50 % as significant CAD in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects were classified into two groups: patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> on cCTA (group I, n = 41) and patients without any evidence of stenosis on cCTA (group II, n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group I showed significantly higher YLK-40 levels and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels than group II (p = 0.038, 0.036, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of chemerin, omentin-1, and sCD26 were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum YKL-40 levels were positively correlated with systolic/diastolic BP, fasting/postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and Framingham risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, YKL-40 levels showed moderate correlation with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> and the coronary artery calcium score determined from cCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, smoking history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, YLK-40 levels showed only borderline significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: YKL-40, which is secreted primarily from inflammatory cells, was associated with several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors and was elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with suspected coronary artery stensosis on cCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the possibility that the inflammatory biomarker YKL-40 might be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in asymptomatic patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
