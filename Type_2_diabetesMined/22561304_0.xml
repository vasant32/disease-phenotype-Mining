<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether APN improves endothelial-dependent nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-mediated vasodilation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and, if so, by what mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested whether exogenous APN delivery improves endothelial function in type 2 diabetic mice and explored the mechanisms underlying the observed improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis, we injected adenovirus APN (Ad-APN) or adenovirus β-galactosidase (Ad-β<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>; control virus) via the tail vein in control (m Lepr(db)) and diabetic (Lepr(db); db/db) mice and studied vascular function of the aorta ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ad-APN improved endothelial-dependent vasodilation in db/db mice compared with Ad-β<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>, whereas Ad-APN had no further improvement on endothelial function in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This improvement was completely inhibited by a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor (N(G)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-l-arginine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and total cholesterol levels were increased in db/db mice, and Ad-APN significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005318'>reduced triglyceride levels</z:mp> but not total cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot results showed that interferon-γ, gp91(phox), and nitrotyrosine were markedly increased in the aorta of db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ad-APN treatment decreased the expression of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and ICAM-1 was elevated in db/db mice, and Ad-APN treatment decreased these expressions in the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that APN may contribute to an increase in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> bioavailability by decreasing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production as well as by inhibiting <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in the aorta in type 2 diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
