<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on experience from experimental and human studies, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> can be considered an important factor lowering the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism consists in the direct influence of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> via nuclear receptors on genes coding proteins associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of B cells of Langerhans islands and genes coding proteins ensuring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is also an indirect influence via regulation of homeostasis of calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical observation and cross-sectional studies show an inverse relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> and appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A major deficit of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 appears to be an independent factor able to predict an increased risk of future cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deficiency in early periods of life was shown to precede autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 1 in an experiment as well as in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> in early as well as later periods of life is a basic pre-requisites of successful preventive measures against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Explicit evidence for the significance of the correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> for improvement of metabolic control in diabetics is still missing mainly due to a low number of intervention, placebo-controlled and randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other side, intervention studies often showed positive influence on the conditions accompanying <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, such as systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike in diabetics, the intervention trials showed positive results in non-diabetics with high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired fasting glycaemia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One can conclude that existing knowledge already indicate that maintaining the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D &gt; 30 ng/ml during the year without seasonal variations will be have multiple real as well as potential health benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A great promise for clinical practice are the structural analogs of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> tested experimentally, which maintain the influence on the immune system, effect of insulin and B cells function, but have suppressed influence on bone and calcium metabolism </plain></SENT>
