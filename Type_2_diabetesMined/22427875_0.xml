<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to test whether CACNA1E common variability affects beta cell function and/or insulin sensitivity in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In 595 GAD-negative, drug naïve patients (mean ± SD; age: 58.5 ± 10.2 yrs; BMI: 29.9 ± 5 kg/m(2), HbA1c: 7.0±1.3) with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> we: 1. genotyped 10 tag SNPs in CACNA1E region reportedly covering ∼93% of CACNA1E common variability: rs558994, rs679931, rs2184945, rs10797728, rs3905011, rs12071300, rs175338, rs3753737, rs2253388 and rs4652679; 2. assessed clinical phenotypes, insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic insulin clamp and beta cell function by state-of-art modelling of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> curves during OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five CACNA1E tag SNPs (rs10797728, rs175338, rs2184945, rs3905011 and rs4652679) were associated with specific aspects of beta cell function (p&lt;0.05-0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both major alleles of rs2184945 and rs3905011 were each (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.005, respectively) associated to reduced proportional control with a demonstrable additive effect (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only the major allele of rs2253388 was related weakly to more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> CACNA1E common variability is strongly associated to beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genotyping CACNA1E might be of help to infer the beta cell functional phenotype and to select a personalized treatment </plain></SENT>
