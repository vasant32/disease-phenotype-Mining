<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cannabinoids relieve the signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> in different experimental models, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>- (STZ-) induced type 1 diabetic rodents, and they may also relieve neuropathic signs in type 2 diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compares the effect of the non-selective cannabinoid <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and in STZ-injected Wistar rats (type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WIN (or its vehicle) was either systemically administered at a non-psychoactive dose or locally injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> were used to characterize WIN antineuropathic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both type 1 and type 2 diabetic rats showed mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> but not <z:mp ids='MP_0003998'>thermal hyperalgesia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WIN alleviated mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> in both models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In STZ-treated rats, both cannabinoid receptors were involved, whereas in ZDF rats, WIN effects seemed to mainly involve the activation of CB1 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher doses of WIN were needed to significantly relieve mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> upon intraplantar administration in ZDF vs. STZ-injected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cannabinoids, acting on systemic and/or peripheral receptors, may serve as a new therapeutic alternative for symptom management in painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> associated with both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our results highlight the need for appropriate selection of diabetic experimental models because the results from studies in STZ-induced diabetic rodents might not be applicable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic situations </plain></SENT>
