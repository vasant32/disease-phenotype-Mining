<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An estimated 25.8 million people in the United States have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including seven million people who have the disease but are undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These numbers indicate that education about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate university students' knowledge about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (risk factors, signs and symptoms and complications) we utilized a survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we determined: (1) knowledge of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; (2) if participants' academic field of study affected their knowledge of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; (3) if participants who had a family member with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a greater knowledge of the disease; and (4) if age affected students' knowledge of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A questionnaire was completed by 469 students from The University of South Dakota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Students' knowledge of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was poor: 30.1 percent of the students scored higher than 70 percent (with only 6.8 percent of the students scoring higher than 80 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in knowledge scores were found between students who pursued health-related fields of study versus students who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants who had a family member with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a greater knowledge of the disease and felt that they had a higher risk for getting the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in knowledge were only found between the youngest and oldest age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: USD students' knowledge of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Solutions need to communicate the risk factors and severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Possible ways for improving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education is to include health fairs as well as to integrate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> modules into K-12 education courses </plain></SENT>
