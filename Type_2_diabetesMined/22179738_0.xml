<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the causal relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on genetic evidence and national outpatient database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty male <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> family history, without a habit of alcohol consumption or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> before the first attack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> were selected from hospital in 2010; and 42 unrelated male Chinese subjects were selected from HapMap as controls for genome-wide analysis study (GWAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comorbid diseases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> were revealed by applying the significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to MetaCore platform, and the comorbid relationship was analysed by standardized incidence ratio (SIR) from outpatient database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 334 SNPs were significantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> in GWAS (P &lt; 10(-7)), and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was the most significantly associated disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> as recognized by 36 gene symbols correspondent to the above significant SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of national outpatient database showed that the overall incident Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.50 cases per 1000 person-months among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> patients, which was higher than the overall incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> (1.06 cases) among Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted SIR of incident Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> was 2.59 (95% CI 2.42, 2.78), whereas the age-adjusted SIR for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> among Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.61 (95% CI 1.48, 1.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and alcohol consumption behaviour, this study showed that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> shared the common genetic factors most, and that there existed a mutual inter-dependent effect on higher incidences </plain></SENT>
