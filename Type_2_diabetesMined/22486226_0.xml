<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods�� This was a pre-specified secondary analysis of randomized trial data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main study found that, compared with usual care, addition of a pharmacist resulted in improvements in blood pressure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> for primary care patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this sub-study, predicted 10-year risk of cardiovascular events at baseline and 1 year were calculated for patients free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at enrolment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was change in UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) risk score; change in Framingham risk score was a secondary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results  Baseline characteristics were similar between the 102 intervention patients and 93 control subjects: 59% women, median (interquartile range) age 57 (50-64) years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 3 (1-6.5) years, systolic blood pressure 128 (120-140) mmHg, total cholesterol 4.34 (3.75-5.04) mmol/l and HbA(1c) 54 mmol/mol (48-64 mmol/mol) [7.1% (6.5-8.0%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median baseline UKPDS risk score was 10.2% (6.0-16.7%) for intervention patients and 9.5% (5.8-15.1%) for control subjects (P = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-year post-randomization, the median absolute reduction in UKPDS risk score was 1.0% greater for intervention patients compared with control subjects (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar changes were seen with the Framingham risk score (median reduction 1.2% greater for intervention patients compared with control subjects, P��= 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The two risk scores were highly correlated (rho = 0.83; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion  Adding pharmacists to primary care teams for 1 year significantly reduced the predicted 10-year risk of cardiovascular events for patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
