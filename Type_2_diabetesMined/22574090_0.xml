<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to find a correlation between inflammatory biomarkers, adiponectin and right ventricular strain and strain rate properties in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 29 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), with coexisting cardiovascular complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (group 1- DM+CV, aged 61.2 ± 4.2 years); and 22 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> only, with no other coexisting cardiovascular complications (group 2- DM, aged 60.86 ± 4.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the right ventricular (rv) function through vector velocity imaging (vvi)and determined the inflammatory profile through assessment of the following biomarkers: high sensitivity C- reactive protein (hsCRP), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alfa), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and adiponectin level for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VVI revealed significantly lower values of systolic strain and strain rates (SR) in the basal segment of the RV free wall in group I patients (DM+CV) as compared to group II patients (DM) which indicates higher impairment of RV systolic function in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups strain and strain rate values were correlated with Lp-PLA2 activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> we identified a low-grade inflammatory status correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1562095" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">right ventricular systolic dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
