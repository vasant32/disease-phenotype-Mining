<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some studies report that up to 80% of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) undergoing RYGB experience complete remission of their T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the majority of remissions occur almost immediately following the operation and long before significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> has taken place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following RYGB, dramatic increases in postprandial plasma concentrations of the incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) have been recorded, and the known <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effects of GLP-1 are thought to be key mediators in RYGB-induced remission of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the published studies on the impact of RYGB on GLP-1 secretion are few, small and often not controlled properly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mechanistic studies delineating the role of endogenous GLP-1 secretion in RYGB-induced remission of T2DM are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article critically evaluates the current evidence for a role of GLP-1 in RYGB-induced remission of T2DM </plain></SENT>
