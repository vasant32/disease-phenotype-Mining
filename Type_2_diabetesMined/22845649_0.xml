<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Background: It has been reported that most pump-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> require only two or fewer basal rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using daily continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM)-directed titration, this premise was re-evaluated at near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and Methods: Thirty subjects who were insulin-naive (n=10), on basal insulin (n=10), or on basal-bolus insulin therapy (n=10) ate a fixed diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basal rate was started as a single rate and then adjusted to a basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> goal of 70-130 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) (in g/U) was adjusted to 2-4-h postmeal CGM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> goal of 80-120% of premeal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: The mean (SE) CGM basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 99.9 (4.9) mg/dL, and 4.5% (1.4%) of the readings were &lt;70 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean 2-4-h postmeal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 113.3% (4.8%) of the premeal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only six subjects (20%) required two basal rates, while the remainder needed only one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean (SE) dosing relationships were as follows: total basal dose (TBD) (in U/day)=0.226(0.018)×weight (in kg); TBD (in U/day)=0.339(0.012)×total daily dose (TDD) (in U/day); ICR (in g/U)=126(8)/TBD (in U/day); and ICR (in g/U)=365(14)/TDD (in U/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: This study confirms that one basal rate is adequate for the majority of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mathematical proportionality between dosing factors closely agrees with those obtained in CGM-titrated pump-treated type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but differs from those derived from clinical studies in which insulin titration was based on infrequent self-monitored plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing and while on an unstructured diet </plain></SENT>
