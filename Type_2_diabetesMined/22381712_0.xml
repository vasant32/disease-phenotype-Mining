<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study provided information on adherence rates in the Texas Medicaid pediatric population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which is rare in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The knowledge of adherence rates in the pediatric population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might help improve the care given to pediatric patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe OAD medication use, and assess trends in medication adherence and persistence among Texas pediatric Medicaid patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Texas Medicaid prescription claims data of patients between 10 and 18 years of age, with at least 2 prescriptions of the same OAD medication from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2009, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence was assessed using the medication possession ratio (MPR) as a proxy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3109 patients met the study's inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) age of the 3109 eligible patients was 14.2 (2.3) years; 60% were Hispanics, 14% were blacks, 13% were whites, and another 13% were other minority races; 67% of the population were females; and 91% were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> of the 6 OAD medications included in the study The overall mean (SD) MPR for patients was 44.69% (27.06%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adherence differed by gender (P &lt; 0.0001), race (P &lt; 0.0001), and age category (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Males had higher mean (SD) MPR (47.47% [27.42%]) compared with females (43.29% [26.78%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean MPR for whites (50.04% [29.65%]) was significantly higher compared with blacks (44.24% [26.16%]) and Hispanics (42.50% [26.10%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients ≤12 years of age had significantly higher mean MPR (48.82% [27.37%]) compared with those in older age categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis suggested that age was significantly related (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.95) to being adherent (MPR ≥80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Males were 25% (OR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.53; P = 0.034) more likely to be adherent (MPR ≥80%) compared with females, and whites were twice as likely to be adherent (MPR ≥80%) compared with Hispanics (OR = 2.02; 95% CI, 1.54-2.66; P = 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall, mean (SD) days to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233419" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">nonpersistence</z:e> was 108 (86) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Persistence was significantly and negatively associated with age (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>White race was significantly related to longer persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adherence and persistence to OAD medications in the selected Texas Medicaid pediatric population between 10 and 18 years was generally suboptimal, especially in adolescents </plain></SENT>
