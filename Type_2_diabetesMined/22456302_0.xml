<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is known to be associated with levofloxacin, patients are continually being hospitalized because of this adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we have reported two further cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and discussed the possibility that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is the result of interactions between levofloxacin and certain drugs, in order to alert physicians to be aware that geriatric patients, particularly those with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in polytherapy, are at risk of showing this adverse reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASES SUMMARY: A 91-year-old woman with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, also under treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi>, platelet antiaggregant, low-molecular- weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and buprenorphine, was prescribed levofloxacin for a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liver function and renal function parameters were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After repeated administration of levofloxacin, her serum glycemic levels had decreased to 47 mg/dl and the patient was in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After stopping levofloxacin her glycemia level returned to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 61 year-old male, affected by tonsillar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, under treatment with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5790">hydromorphone</z:chebi> and undergoing nutritional support, was treated with levofloxacin for a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 72 h the patient was unresponsive and his blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were 38 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After discontinuation of levofloxacin administration the patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion and his glycemic values gradually returned to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The causality relationship between the levofloxacin and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was established using Naranjo's ADR probability scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These case reports confirm the literature data that serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> may develop due to the use of levofloxacin and appears to occur most frequently in elderly patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are receiving oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We described the possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodinamic mechanisms of the interaction between levofloxacin and the other drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesized that the concomitant use of several drugs and particularly levofloxacin in association with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35482">opioid analgesics</z:chebi> and low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> could concur to cause this side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The safety and tolerability of this anti-infective agent should be revised urgently </plain></SENT>
