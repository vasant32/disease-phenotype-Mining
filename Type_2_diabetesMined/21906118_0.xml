<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are at greater risk of bone fractures than nondiabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the risk factors for fractures in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have not been fully evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the relative frequency of fractures at different sites and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated factors that affect nontraumatic bone fracture in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND DESIGN: This retrospective case-control study recruited 144 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who presented with nontraumatic fractures between March 2004 and March 2009 and 150 age-, gender-, body mass index (BMI)- and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nontraumatic fractures were confirmed using patients' medical records and radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were examined for their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status and associated factors for fracture, including bone mineral density (BMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 150 reported bone fractures, the hip was the most frequent fracture site (32·7%), followed by the upper extremity (19·3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nontraumatic fractures were associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history, previous fracture and insulin treatment (P &lt; 0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, independently associated factors for bone fracture were diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) = 37·3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1·46-652·57] and previous fracture (OR = 9·54, 95% CI = 1·18-77·37; P &lt; 0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The hip was the most frequent site of nontraumatic fracture, and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> was significantly associated with an increased risk of nontraumatic fractures in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
