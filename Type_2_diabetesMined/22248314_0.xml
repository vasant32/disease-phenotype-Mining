<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of self-rated health may be different in populations with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions, such as populations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the characteristics of self-rated health in a Canadian community sample of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Self-rated health was obtained from 1837 adults with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participating in the Montreal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Health and Well-Being Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global disability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II and the Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regressions studied the association between self-rated health and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, disability, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related characteristics, socio-demographic factors, social support and lifestyle-related behaviours in both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants' answers were dichotomized into excellent/very good/ good (78%) and fair/poor (22%) self-rated health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (men: odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.6; women: odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9) and disability (men: odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-1.9; women: odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.9) were associated with fair/poor self-rated health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The associations remained unchanged even after controlling for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After controlling for confounding variables, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions were associated with fair/poor self-rated health in both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was associated with fair/poor self-rated health in women only, while lifestyle behaviours such as being physically active and alcohol consumption were associated with good/very good/excellent self-rated health in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In men and women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and disability are important factors that are associated with self-rated health in a large sample of individuals with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
