<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is 10(3)-fold more concentrated in the intracellular than in the extracellular milieu due to a specific <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>-Na-dependent transporter (TauT), which is upregulated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001276'>hypertonicity</z:hpo>, low extracellular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and acutely downregulated 'in vitro' by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to investigate whether TauT expression was modified in mononuclear peripheral blood cells (MPC) of type 2 diabetic patients with or without micro/macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median value (interquartile range) of plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> was significantly lower in diabetic patients than in controls [28.7 (13.7) μmol/l vs. 46.5 (20.3) μmol/l; P&lt;0.05], while median TauT expression, in arbitrary units, was significantly higher in diabetics than in controls [3.8 (3.9) vs. 1 (1.3); P&lt;0.05) and was related to HbA1c only in controls (r=0.34; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (n=25) had lower TauT expression than those who were unaffected [3.1 (2.8) vs. 4.1 (3.4); P&lt;0.05], while persistent micro/macroalbuminuria was associated with unchanged TauT expression </plain></SENT>
