<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNA were extracted from the fecal samples from 50 type 2 diabetic patients and 30 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative PCR was employed to determine the copy numbers of the bacteria in the fecal samples using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA-targeted genus- and species-specific PCR primers for a selected group of fecal Bifidobacterium species including total Bifidobacterium, B.longum, B.breve, B.adolescentis, and B. infantis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diabetic group had significantly lower copy numbers of total Bifidobacterium and B.adolescentis compared to the healthy individuals (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Type 2 diabetic patients have a lowered number of Bifidobacterium species in the gut microflora </plain></SENT>
