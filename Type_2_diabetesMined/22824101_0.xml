<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> is often difficult to achieve in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> drugs are often advocated to support dietary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the extensive use of centrally acting anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> drugs, there is little evidence of how they affect dietary composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated changes in energy intake and dietary composition of macro- and micronutrients following therapy with the endocannabinoid receptor blocker, rimonabant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied before and after 6 months dietary intervention with rimonabant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary intervention was supervised by a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> dietician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-day food diaries were completed at baseline and at 6 months and dietary analysis was performed using computer software (Dietplan 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 6 months, (compared with baseline) there were reductions in weight (107+/-21Kg versus 112+/-21, p&lt;0.001, 4% body weight reduction), and improvements in HbA1c (7.4+/-1.7 versus 8.0+/-1.6%, p&lt;0.05) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intake of energy (1589+/-384 versus 2225+/-1109kcal, p&lt;0.01), carbohydrate (199+/-74 versus 273+/-194g, p&lt;0.05), protein (78+/-23 versus 98+/-36g, p&lt;0.05), fats (55+/-18 versus 84+/-39g, p&lt;0.01) and several micronutrients were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, relative macronutrient composition of the diet was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was strongly correlated with a reduction in carbohydrate intake (r = 0.76, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, rimonabant in combination with dietary intervention led to reduced intake of energy and most macronutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite this, macronutrient composition of the diet was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These dietary changes (especially carbohydrate restriction) were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and favourable metabolic effects </plain></SENT>
