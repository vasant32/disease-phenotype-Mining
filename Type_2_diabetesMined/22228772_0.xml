<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 1123 participants, 290 men and 271 women were randomised to screening with stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI); 311 men and 251 women were randomised to no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 4.8Â±0.9 years for the occurrence of cardiac events (CE; cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of abnormal screening was similar in men (24%) and women (19%), (p=0.2), although women trended to have smaller MPI abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CE rates were lower in women than men (1.7% vs. 3.8%, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No CEs occurred in 17 high-risk (UKPDS risk engine) women, whereas 14 (11.2%) occurred in 125 high-risk men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic women with T2DM have significantly better cardiac outcomes than their male counterparts and represent a subgroup for which screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> does not appear warranted </plain></SENT>
