<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in Asian patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recruited ten Japanese patients whose fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels remained poorly controlled under meal-time injection of short-acting insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was added to their insulin therapy, and both hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake were assessed before and one week after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment, with the use of stable isotope [6,6-(2)H(2)] <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was titrated to a maximum dose of 500 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production were significantly improved after the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.02), whereas their peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was not significantly changed (p = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the change of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels was significantly correlated with that of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, whose coefficient œÅ was 0.76 (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was no significant correlation between the change of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and that of peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (p = 0.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> significantly reduced hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on correcting fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was strongly associated with reduced hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, rather than ameliorated peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
