<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the emotional approach to coping on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the relationship between emotional coping and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge, medication adherence and self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on 378 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recruited from two primary care clinics in the southeastern United States were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously validated scales were used to measure coping, medication adherence, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors (including diet, physical activity, blood sugar testing and foot care) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was used to assess the independent effect of coping through emotional approach on medication adherence and self-care behaviors while controlling for relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed between emotional coping [as measured by emotional expression (EE) and emotional processing (EP)] and self-care behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the linear regression model, EP was significantly associated with medication adherence [β -0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.32 to -0.015], <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge (β 0.76, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.24), diet (β 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.81), exercise (β 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82), blood sugar testing (β 0.54, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91) and foot care (β 0.32, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, EE was associated with diet (β 0.38, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.64), exercise (β 0.54, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.82), blood sugar testing (β 0.42, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.76) and foot care (β 0.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.66), but it was not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that coping through an emotional approach is significantly associated with behaviors that lead to positive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes </plain></SENT>
