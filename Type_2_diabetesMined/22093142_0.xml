<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The multinational ADDITION-study, a cluster-randomized parallel group trial in patients with screen-detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, compared the effectiveness of intensive multifactorial treatment (IT; lifestyle advice and strict regulation of metabolic parameters) with routine care (RC) on cardiovascular outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In The Netherlands randomization was stratified according to practice organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allocation was concealed from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the effect of IT on cognition through two neuropsychological assessments (NPA) on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assessments took place three and six years after the start of the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-diabetic controls served as reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first NPA was performed in 183 patients (IT: 97; RC: 86) and 69 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second NPA was performed in 135 patients (IT: 71; RC: 64) and 55 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was a composite score, including the domains memory, information-processing speed and attention and executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between the treatment groups were performed with multi-level analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first NPA showed no differences between the treatment groups (mean difference composite z-score: 0.00; 95%-CI -0.16 to 0.16; IT vs RC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Over the next three years <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in the diabetic groups was within the range of the reference group and did not differ between the treatment arms (difference decline between diabetic groups -0.12; -0.24 to 0.01; IT vs RC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Six years of IT in screen-detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had no benefit on cognitive functioning over RC </plain></SENT>
