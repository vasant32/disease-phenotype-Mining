<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D), which predominates in older individuals and is increasing globally as a consequence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic, is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or even increased dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived areal bone mineral density (BMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the paradoxical increase in fracture risk has led to the hypothesis that there are <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated alterations in material and structural properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An overly glycated collagen matrix, confounded by a low turnover state, in the setting of subtle cortical abnormalities, may lead to compromised biomechanical competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In current clinical practice, because BMD is central to fracture prediction, a consequence of this paradox is a lack of suitable methods, including FRAX, to predict fracture risk in older adults with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The option of adding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to the FRAX algorithm is appealing but requires additional data from large population-based cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The need for improved methods for identification of fracture in older adults with T2D is an important priority for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> research. Â© 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research </plain></SENT>
