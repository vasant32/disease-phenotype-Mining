<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Urine levels of tubular markers (kidney injury molecule [KIM]-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL] and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein [L-FABP]), proinflammatory marker (IL-18), and a marker of intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) status (angiotensinogen) were determined in 118 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 25 non-diabetic controls with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urinary levels of KIM-1, NGAL, IL-18 and angiotensinogen were significantly higher in macroalbuminuria group compared with control and normo- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> groups but not significantly different between control and normoalbuminuria group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary tubular markers were positively correlated with urinary IL-18 and angiotensinogen, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The urinary <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated urinary markers in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for several clinical parameters, urinary KIM-1, NGAL and angiotensinogen were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that urinary tubular markers may be independently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetics (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and may reflect inflammatory processing and the activation of the intrarenal <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
