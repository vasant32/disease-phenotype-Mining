<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sex disparity in the treatment of modifiable CHD risk factors in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been reported previously; however, there is little comparable information in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 1153 subjects with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) cohort to compare achievement of metabolic and CHD risk factor goals and use of recommended risk factor interventions between the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women were less likely than men to achieve glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c)&lt;7.0% [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.995] or&lt;8.0% (AOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Achievement of target <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels was not significantly different between the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As in the non-diabetic population, men had higher blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women were significantly less likely than men to report using aspirin (AOR 0.77, 0.60-0.99) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers (ARBs) (AOR 0.62, 0.49-0.80) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (AOR 0.56, 0.43-0.73), even after adjusting for blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reported use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> was also lower in women than men in the subset that developed a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol level&gt;3.4 mmol/l (39% vs. 60%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, women report lower frequency than men in the use of interventions that decrease CHD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with reports in the Type 2 diabetic population, showing that risk-reducing measures are underused in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
