<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our randomized, controlled, multicenter, prospective intervention trial included 1173 elderly type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients who were enrolled from 39 Japanese institutions and randomized to an intensive or conservative treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> and atherosclerotic disease were measured annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instrumental activity of daily living, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, depressive symptoms and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> burden were assessed at baseline and 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in clinical or cognitive parameters at baseline between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of low activities of daily living, depressive symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was 13%, 28% and 4%, respectively, and was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A small, but significant difference in HbA1c between the two groups was observed at 1 year after the start of intervention (7.9% vs 8.1%, P &lt; 0.05), although this significant difference was not observed after the second year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the exception of coronary revascularization, there was no significant difference in fatal or non-fatal events between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Composite events were also similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no significant differences in fatal or non-fatal events between intensive and conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study might clarify whether treatment of risk factors influences function and quality of life in elderly diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
