<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the primary prevention studies that focused on the development, validation and impact assessment of a cardiovascular risk model, scores or rules that can be applied to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Systematic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Medline was searched from 1966 to 1 April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: A study was eligible when it described the development, validation or impact assessment of a model that was constructed to predict the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or when the model was designed for use in the general population but included <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: A standardized form was sued to extract <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 45 prediction models were identified, of which 12 were specifically developed for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 31% of the risk scores has been externally validated in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> population, with an area under the curve ranging from 0.61 to 0.86 and 0.59 to 0.80 for models developed in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> population and in the general population, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one risk score has been studied for its effect on patient management and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>10% of the risk scores are advocated in national <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Many cardiovascular risk scores are available that can be applied to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A minority of these risk scores has been validated and tested for its predictive accuracy, with only a few showing a discriminative value of â‰¥0.80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The impact of applying these risk scores in clinical practice is almost completely unknown, but their use is recommended in various national guidelines </plain></SENT>
