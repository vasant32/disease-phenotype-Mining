<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: UK-based interventions that assess <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and/or target known risk factors were identified through four main sources: submissions to two calls for evidence by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence; local practice examples collected via a targeted mail-out; selected electronic databases; and a focused search of relevant websites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No restriction was placed on the study type or evaluation methods used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Key themes and sub-themes on outcomes, as well as facilitators and barriers to successful delivery, are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four interventions met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inclusion criteria: 15 included a risk identification element and 14 included preventative activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A range of risk identification tools were used to improve diagnosis of unmet <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related health needs and raise awareness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> preventative interventions focused on lifestyle change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No interventions monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as an outcome and only one reported improvements in baseline risk scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Facilitators include tailored and flexible programme design, outreach delivery in familiar locations and effective inter-agency working </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Barriers included literacy and language difficulties, transient participant populations, low prioritization of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to engage successfully with high-risk adults in vulnerable groups to achieve positive health outcomes relevant to the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, more robust evidence on longer-term outcomes is required to ensure that programmes are targeted and delivered appropriately. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
