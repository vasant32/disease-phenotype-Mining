<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T2DM is often comorbid with several other metabolic disturbances, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These comorbid diseases might be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many clinical indices should be included as variables for the association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we tried to identify the associated factors with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> during a 6-year period in elderly T2DM considering the changes in the clinical indices during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects in the present study were 63 Japanese Elderly Interventional Trial participants who were administered the Mini-Mental State Examination at baseline, at the third year, and at the end of the 6-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We applied the pooled logistic analysis method to consider the changes in clinical indices during the observation period and tried to identify the factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> during the 6 years in elderly type 2 diabetics using repeated measured data for glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, blood pressure and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the current study, low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> and higher diastolic blood pressure were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> by pooled logistic analysis in the 6-year observation of older diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c had a tendency toward association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that comprehensive management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, might contribute to the prevention of declines in cognitive function in older diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
