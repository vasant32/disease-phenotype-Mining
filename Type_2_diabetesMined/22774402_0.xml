<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, 10%-20% of patients with an arterial thrombotic event who are treated with aspirin have a recurrent arterial thrombotic event during long-term followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aspirin resistance has been described in some patient populations such as those with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent, stent re-stenosis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess aspirin resistance and to compare it to the use of oral anti-diabetic drugs and insulin in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Platelet aggregation was measured after aspirin treatment in 101 diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patient populations were included in the investigation: use of insulin (group 1) and use of oral anti-diabetic agents (OAD) (group 2) in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was determined using a multichannel Multiplate analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among group 1 patients, 4.7% were aspirin non-responders and among group 2 patients, 8.6% were aspirin non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences were not found between the groups (p = 0.359) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that there was no significant difference in aspirin resistance between type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients on insulin treatment and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients on OAD treatment </plain></SENT>
