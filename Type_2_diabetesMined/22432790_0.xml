<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colesevelam <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrant (BAS), is approved for adjunctive therapy to diet and exercise for glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In clinical studies in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, colesevelam, added to existing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or insulin therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011905'>reduced hemoglobin A</z:hpo>(1c) (HbA(1c)) by a mean of 0.5% and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) by 13-17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: Information pertaining to colesevelam and other BAS was collected using a PubMed literature search of journal articles dating from 1960 to present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional articles were identified from bibliographies and from abstracts from American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association conferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors review the pharmacology of colesevelam as well as clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability data generated from clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Colesevelam induces moderate but significant improvements in HbA(1c) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcomes data are needed to determine whether or not colesevelam confers long-term protection against micro- and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although colesevelam does not induce <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels tend to increase ~ 15%, the implications of which are unknown at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) by which colesevelam improves glycemia are not yet understood but might involve enhanced meal-induced incretin secretion and altered farnesoid X receptor signaling </plain></SENT>
