<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 32 hypercholesterolaemic type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, defined as a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) 30 but &lt; 300 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various clinical and laboratory parameters were determined at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with 10 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">Ezetimibe</z:chebi> treatment significantly decreased glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and UAE, and significantly increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> and albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also decreased the serum level of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1), but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses showed a correlation between UAE and body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, estimated glomerular filtration rate (inverse), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since these parameters may be closely correlated with each other, multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed and demonstrated that HbA(1c) and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 were independent determinants of UAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">Ezetimibe</z:chebi> may be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving albumin excretion, partly through its anti-inflammatory properties, and for reducing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> in hypercholesterolaemic type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
