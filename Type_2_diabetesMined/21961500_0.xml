<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case control study comprised of 1794 patient (740 males and 1054 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The correlation was found for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile with age and gender in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a positive significant correlation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentrations significantly varied amongst ethnicity (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the known ethnicities, East Indians had the highest mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> value (1.00 ± 0.47 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The univariate general linear model showed that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile had many associations with gender and ethnicity in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> had significant differences between gender (p = 0.04) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Varied <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> and BMI are associated in type 2 diabetic patients with respect to age, gender and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
