<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the frequency and contributing factors of intake of fruits and vegetables rich in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, and we determined their impact on the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, run in Congo among 244 people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An intake of ≥three servings of vegetables rich in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>/day, intake of red beans, consumption of fruit, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction were considered as dependent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient reported a fruit intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intake of red beans was reported by 64 patients (26.2%), while 77 patients (31.6%) reported ≥three servings of vegetables rich in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High socioeconomic status (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-12.5; P = 0.030) and moderate alcohol intake (OR = 4; 95% CI: 1.1-17.4; P = 0.049) were the independent determinants of eating ≥three servings of vegetables rich in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Red beans intake (OR = 0.282; 95% CI: 0.115-0.687; P &lt; 0.01) and eating ≥three servings of vegetables rich in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> (OR = 0.256; 95% CI: 0.097-0.671; P = 0.006) were identified as independent and protective factors against the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> (9.8% n = 24), whereas type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> duration ≥3 years was the independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction (OR = 6.3; 95% CI: 2.1-19.2; P &lt; 0.001 in the model with red beans intake and OR = 7.1; 95% CI: 2.3-22.2; P &lt; 0.001 in the model with ≥three servings of vegetables rich in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Red beans intake and adequate quantity of intake of vegetables rich in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> were found to be associated with reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> in these Congolese with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
