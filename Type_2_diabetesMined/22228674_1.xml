<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most studies show that less than 50% of women receive any <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> screening in the postpartum period and are thus denied this opportunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although many have advocated for simpler testing, the 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test remains the gold standard as fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level will miss 30-40% of cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and will not detect isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
