<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The impact of several environmental and genetic factors on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications is well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been established that cytokines play a key role in the regulation of immune responses which have been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies showed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the -592 region of interleukin-10 (IL-10) are associated with the regulation of its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to find polymorphisms of this region that may be associated to type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, peripheral blood samples were collected from 100 T2D patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, 100 T2D patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and 100 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted, and a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was performed to examine the polymorphisms within the -592 region of the IL-10 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed a significant difference between the genotypes and alleles of the -592 region of IL-10 in nephropathic and non-nephropathic patients in comparison to the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences between the two patient groups in relation to genotypes and alleles were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results of this study suggest that the functional gene polymorphism of IL-10 reported here may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but it seems that these polymorphisms do not have an effect on the nephropathic complications of the disease </plain></SENT>
