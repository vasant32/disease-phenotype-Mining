<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined whether common variation in genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) contributes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility or influences <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: OxPhos gene variants (n = 10) that had been nominally associated (p &lt; 0.01) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a recent genome-wide meta-analysis (n = 10,108) were selected for follow-up in 3,599 type 2 diabetic and 4,956 glucose-tolerant Danish individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of these variants was performed in 11,729 type 2 diabetic patients and 43,943 non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact on OGTT-derived metabolic traits was evaluated in 5,869 treatment-naive individuals from the Danish Inter99 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minor alleles of COX10 rs9915302 (p = 0.02) and COX5B rs1466100 (p = 0.005) showed nominal association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our Danish cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in the meta-analysis, none of the investigated variants showed a robust association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after correction for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the alleles potentially associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, none negatively influenced surrogate markers of insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic participants, while the minor alleles of UQCRC1 rs2228561 and COX10 rs10521253 showed a weak (p &lt; 0.01 to p &lt; 0.05) negative influence on indices of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We cannot rule out the possibility that common variants in or near OxPhos genes may influence beta cell function in non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, our quantitative trait studies and a sufficiently large meta-analysis indicate that common variation in proximity to the examined OxPhos genes is not a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
