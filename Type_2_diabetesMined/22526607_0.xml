<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that ZnT8 is also recognised by CD8(+) T cells and aimed to identify HLA-A2 (A*02:01)-restricted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Candidate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were selected by ZnT8 plasmid DNA immunisation of HLA-A2/DQ8 transgenic mice and tested for T cell recognition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of type 1 diabetic, type 2 diabetic and healthy participants by IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: White HLA-A2(+) adults (83%) and children (60%) with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> displayed ZnT8-reactive CD8(+) T cells that recognised a single ZnT8(186-194) (VAANIVLTV) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This ZnT8(186-194)-reactive fraction accounted for 50% to 53% of total ZnT8-specific CD8(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another sequence, ZnT8(153-161) (VVTGVLVYL), was recognised in 20% and 25% of type 1 diabetic adults and children, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific, being marginally recognised by type 2 diabetic and healthy participants (7-12% for ZnT8(186-194), 0% for ZnT8(153-161)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: ZnT8-reactive CD8(+) T cells are predominantly directed against the ZnT8(186-194) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> and are detected in a majority of type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The exceptional immunodominance of ZnT8(186-194) may point to common environmental triggers precipitating beta cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
