<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HIFs also play a role in regulating cellular processes in Î²-cells, liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, have effects on the regulation of weight, and play a role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in people with T2D the HIF pathway is dyregulated in major metabolic tissues involved in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review covers the contrasting, complementary and conflicting effects of decreasing and increasing HIFs in various tissues, and shows that a delicate balance exists between HIF levels and optimal metabolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that increasing the activity of HIFs might be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating T2D </plain></SENT>
