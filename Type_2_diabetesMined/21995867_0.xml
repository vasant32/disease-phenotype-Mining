<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sixteen patients (mean BMI 28.6 kg/m(2)) took part, on separate days, in two randomly ordered conditions, in a within-subject design: a 20 min semi-self-paced brisk walk or passive control (sitting with the opportunity of reading) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes before, during (5, 10, 15, 20 min) and following (5, 10, 15, 20, 180 min) each, participants completed the Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) for affective activation and the Feeling Scale (FS) for affective pleasure/valence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Activation Deactivation Adjective Check List (Tense Arousal and Energetic Arousal) was also completed before and after each condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart rate and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were assessed during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> levels were obtained from participants before and after exercise and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant condition by time interaction effects for FS, FAS, Energetic Arousal (EA) and Tense Arousal (TA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brisk walking increased FS (15 min after exercise p=0.020; 20 min after exercise p=0.034) and FAS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points after baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EA was significantly higher 5 min after the exercise session (p=0.029) in comparison to the control situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exercise bout has positive influences on affect and psychological well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of exercise to elevate affective responses (activation and pleasure) should be highlighted when promoting exercise interventions in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
