<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limits in resources often prevent the participation of many patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to structured education programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of predictors of response to group education could help in selecting those patients in whom the intervention is more cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A structured interactive group program was proposed to a consecutive series of 150 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, who were then followed prospectively in 24 months, with measurements of HbA1c, BMI, quality of life, eating habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison, another consecutive series of 113 patients who had received no intervention was also observed for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in the intervention group at 12 and 24 months (from 7.5 ± 1.4 to 6.9 ± 1.2 and 6.6 ± 1.1% at 12 and 24 months, respectively, both P &lt; 0.01), with no variation in BMI and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A sustained reduction in total energy, protein, and fat intake was observed after education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of success (HbA1c &lt; 7% and/or HbA1c reduction from baseline &gt; 1%) in the intervention group was 60.7% (vs. 38.1% in controls) and 63.3% at 12 and 24 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the intervention group, patients with success at 12 months showed lower baseline HbA1c, BMI, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, protein, and cholesterol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a lower duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appear to have a greater response to structured group education, whereas age is not a predictor of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, educational intervention should be planned in the earlier phases of the disease </plain></SENT>
