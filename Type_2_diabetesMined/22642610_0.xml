<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the United Kingdom, there is a lack of research investigating optimal methods of translating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programmes, based on the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, into routine primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to establish the behavioural and clinical effectiveness of a structured educational programme designed to target perceptions and knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and promote a healthily lifestyle, particularly increased walking activity, in a multi-ethnic population at a high risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial undertaken at the level of primary care practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up will be conducted at 12, 24 and 36â€‰months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is change in objectively measured ambulatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes include progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, biochemical variables (including fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>), anthropometric variables, quality of life and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 10 primary care practices will be recruited to the study (5 intervention, 5 control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within each practice, individuals at high risk of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation will be identified using an automated version of the Leicester Risk Assessment tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals scoring within the 90th percentile in each practice will be invited to take part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Practices will be assigned to either the control group (advice leaflet) or the intervention group, in which participants will be invited to attend a 3 hour structured educational programme designed to promote physical activity and a healthy lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Participants in the intervention practices will also be invited to attend annual group-based maintenance workshops and will receive telephone contact halfway between annual sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study will run from 2010-2014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study will provide new evidence surrounding the long-term effectiveness of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programme run within routine primary care in the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.Gov identifier: NCT00941954 </plain></SENT>
