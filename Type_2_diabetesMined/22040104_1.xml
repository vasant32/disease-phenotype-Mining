<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) has increased markedly worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent epidemiological study reported that approximately 63% of T2DM patients also have <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (&gt;130/80 mmHg), which doubles their risk of cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the medications used to treat T2DM, the incretins are a group of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that not only regulate blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectively and moderately, but also protect patients against cardiovascular events and improve several cardiovascular parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here were review data from preclinical and short- and long-term clinical studies investigating the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effects of incretins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also elucidate four possible mechanisms underlying the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effects of incretins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that incretins can lower blood pressure of T2DM patients, independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and will surely improve the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
