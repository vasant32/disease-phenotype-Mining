<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most widely recognized types of β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (type 1 programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of β-cells is the key and final step in the development of T1D and contributes to β-cell failure or dysfunction in T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the course of natural T1D, apoptotic β-cells undergoing secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> probably due to their defective clearance by phagocytes, may be involved in the initiation and development of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, autophagy (type 2 programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) is proposed as a third type of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and is being recognized as having certain roles in the prevention and execution of β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, depending on the cellular context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as dying β-cells are routinely exposed to the immune system, β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could also affect the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe the role of various types of pancreatic β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the development of T1D and T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also discuss the role of dying β-cells in the control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> which contributes to the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
