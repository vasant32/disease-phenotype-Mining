<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial diagnosis was type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because she was <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, did not have type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> antibodies and both parents had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was low in the proband and her father (≤0.1 mg/l) indicating that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was unlikely, and that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-α-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (HNF1A-MODY) was the most likely diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a genetic diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY in the proband and her father, both patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>, with improvement in HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case highlights the challenges of making a correct diagnosis of MODY in young <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors report the first case where hsCRP, an easily available biomarker, has been used on an individual level to determine appropriate genetic testing of MODY in a family whose main differential diagnosis was familial type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
