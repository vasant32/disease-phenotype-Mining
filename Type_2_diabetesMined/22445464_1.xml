<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue modulates metabolism by secreting a variety of factors, which exhibit altered production during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apelin, a small <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> present in a number of tissues and also produced and secreted by adipocytes, has emerged as a new player with potent functions in energy metabolism, and in insulin sensitivity improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe the various metabolic functions that are affected by apelin and we present an integrated overview of recent findings that collectively propose apelin as a promising target for the treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
