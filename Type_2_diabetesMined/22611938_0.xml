<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> rats were established by feeding with high-fat-diet and injecting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly assigned to four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high-fat-diets were administrated <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> at a dose of 2000 (high <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> group), 1000 (medium <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> group) and 200 (low <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Model control group was only fed with high-fat-diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> control group was fed with common diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats ate freely for four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was detected by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidase method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin was detected by radio-immunity method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of IR of pancreas and skeletal muscle were detected by immunohistochemistry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The immunohistochemistry pictures were analyzed by Image-Pro Plus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with model control group, the expression levels of IR of pancreas and skeletal muscle were 0.341 +/- 0.001 and 0.346 +/- 0.002, increased and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased significantly in high <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> group (P &lt; 0.05 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> intake may increase the expression levels of IR of pancreas and skeletal muscle, and decrease fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> rats </plain></SENT>
