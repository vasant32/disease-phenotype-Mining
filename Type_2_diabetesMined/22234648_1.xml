<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that QoL improves significantly with supervised exercise, whereas it worsens with counselling alone, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the Italian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and Exercise Study (IDES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report data on the relationship between changes in QoL and volume of physical activity/exercise in these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicentre parallel randomised controlled, open-label, trial enrolled sedentary patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 606 of 691 eligible) in 22 outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised by centre, age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment using a permuted-block design to twice-a-week supervised aerobic and resistance training plus exercise counselling (exercise group) versus counselling alone (control group) for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Health-related QoL was assessed by the 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the exercise group (n = 268 of 303 randomised), there was a trend for increasing QoL with increasing exercise volume, with significant improvement of the physical component summary (PCS) measure only above 17.5 metabolic equivalents h⁻¹ week⁻¹ and a clear volume-relationship for the mental component summary (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A relationship with volume of physical activity also was observed in the control group (n = 260 of 303 randomised), despite overall deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent correlates of improvements in both PCS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> were exercise volume, study arm and, inversely, baseline score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This large trial shows a relationship between changes in physical and mental health-related QoL measures and volume of physical activity/exercise, with supervised exercise training also providing volume-independent benefits </plain></SENT>
