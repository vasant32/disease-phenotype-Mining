<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several countries have not incorporated its use for this purpose yet and there is no consensus on a suitable cut-off point of HbA(1c) for the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic characteristics of HbA(1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) for the assessment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FPG, HbA(1c), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were assessed in 47 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 46 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The areas under the curve for HbA(1c) &gt; or = 6.5% and FPG &gt; or = 7.0 mmol/L were 0.97 and 0.92, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c). has a slightly higher ability to discriminate type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between HbA(1c) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was independent of gender, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HbA(1c) was able to be used for the diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
