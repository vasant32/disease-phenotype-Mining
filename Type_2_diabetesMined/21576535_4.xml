<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the effect of adding a third antihyperglycemic drug when blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control is not achieved by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of add-on antihyperglycemic drugs in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that is not controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov electronic databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials at least 24 weeks in duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies evaluated the effects of adding a third antihyperglycemic drug to treatment of adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) level greater than 7.0% who were already receiving a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Primary end points were change in HbA(1c) level, change in weight, and frequency of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: Eighteen trials involving 4535 participants that lasted a mean of 31.3 weeks (24 to 52 weeks) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, drug classes did not differ in effect on HbA(1c) level (reduction ranging from -0.70% [95% credible interval {CrI}, -1.33% to -0.08%] for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> to -1.08% [CrI, -1.41% to -0.77%] for insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weight increase was seen with insulins (2.84 kg [CrI, 1.76 to 3.90 kg]) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (4.25 kg [CrI, 2.76 to 5.66 kg]), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was seen with glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 agonists (-1.63 kg [CrI, -2.71 to -0.60 kg]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulins caused twice the absolute number of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> than noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Most of the trials were short term, and trial quality varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With so few trials relative to antihyperglycemic agents, investigators relied on indirect comparisons, which increased the uncertainty of the findings and conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no clear difference in benefit between drug classes when adding a third agent to treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are already receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most appropriate option should depend on each patient's clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
