<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the proposed reduction of tubular action by insulin detemir, type 2 diabetic patients should have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003608'>increased urinary sodium</z:hpo> excretion, thereby reducing extracellular volume and body weight when changed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin to insulin detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a randomised, open-labelled, two-way crossover study of 24 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, patients were first treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin or insulin detemir for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, they were changed to the other insulin for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a third 1 week period, they were changed back to the first insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of 8 weeks, body weight was reduced by 0.8 ± 0.2 kg (mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) on insulin detemir compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After insulin detemir treatment, we also observed a significant reduction of lean body mass (0.8 ± 0.2 kg, p &lt; 0.05) and a non-significant reduction of extracellular volume (0.8 ± 0.5 l/1.73 m², p = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> occurred after as early as 1 week (0.8 ± 0.2 kg, p &lt; 0.001), with a simultaneous and transient increase of urinary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin detemir induces significant and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, which is first observed at 1 week after changing from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> seems to be related to changes in fluid volume and may reflect changed insulin action in the kidneys </plain></SENT>
