<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine: (1) the level of health care access for older Hispanics with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> living in a US-Mexico border area; and (2) personal and health correlates to health care utilization (ie, physician visits, eye care, emergency room [ER] use) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was a cross-sectional study based on a community assessment conducted at a clinic, senior centers, and colonias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonias are impoverished neighborhoods with substandard living conditions along the US-Mexico border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hispanics living in colonias are one of the most disadvantaged minority groups in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study sample consisted of 249 Hispanics age 60 years and older who have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Descriptive analyses, multiple linear regression, and generalized linear models were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older age (P = 0.02) and affordability of physician fees (P = 0.02) were significant correlates to more frequent physician visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly associated with eye care were being insured (P = 0.001) and reporting high cholesterol (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ER use was significantly associated with younger age (60-64 years old; P = 0.03) and suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those who received <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education (P = 0.04) were less likely to use the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identifying patterns of health care utilization services in aging underserved minorities who are disproportionately affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may lead to culturally appropriate preventive practices and timely access to health care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Adequate health care access can decrease or delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications in older Hispanics with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who live along the US-Mexico border </plain></SENT>
