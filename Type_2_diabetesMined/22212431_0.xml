<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of AVE8134 on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in dyslipidemic mice and type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cell based PPAR Gal4 transactivation assay was constructed for testing the activities of AVE8134 at 3 different PPAR isoforms in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transgenic human Apo A1 (hApo A1) mice and insulin-resistant ZDF rats were used to evaluate the effects of AVE8134 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AVE8134 was a full PPARα dominated PPAR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (the values of EC(50) for human and rodent PPARα receptor were 0.01 and 0.3 μmol/L, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AVE8134 was not active at PPARδ receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In female hApo A1 mice, AVE8134 (1-30 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), po for 12 d) dose-dependently lowered the plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and increased the serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, hApo A1 and mouse Apo E levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In female ZDF rats, AVE8134 (3-30 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 2 weeks) improved insulin-sensitivity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> male ZDF rats (at the age of 7 weeks), AVE8134 (10 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 8 weeks) produced an anti-diabetic action comparable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, without the PPARγ mediated adverse effects on body weight and heart weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In male ZDF rats (at the age of 6 weeks), AVE8134 (20 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 12 weeks) increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of the target genes LPL and PDK4 about 20 fold in the liver, and there was no relevant effect with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AVE8134 improves <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in dyslipidemic mice and type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
