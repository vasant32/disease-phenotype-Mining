<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to elucidate the character and severity of electrophysiological disturbances in the patients presenting with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AH) associated with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It included 55 patients with AH (mean age 50.4 +- 4.7 years) allocated to two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was comprised of 25 patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and concomitant type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 2 (n = 30) consisted of the patients with AH in the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were examined using 12-lead ECG and high-resolution ECG (HR-ECG) supplemented by the analysis of late ventricular potentials (LVP) and cardiac rhythm variability (CRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study has demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in the patients suffering AH aggravates the disturbances in electrophysiological properties of myocardium compared with the patients having no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These disturbances include changes of both repolarization and depolarization of myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with AH and concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> had much higher values of dispersion and duration of QT-interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the results of HR-ECG in the two groups has revealed a significantly higher occurrence of late ventricular potentials in the patients with AH and concomitant type 2 DM (52% and 27% respectively; x2 = 4.43, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of rhythmograms showed progressive deterioration of temporal and spectral characteristics of CRV in the group of patients with AH and concomitant type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover; these patients were characterized by the reduction of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on myocardium </plain></SENT>
