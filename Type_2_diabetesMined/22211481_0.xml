<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:   <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi>-associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2) is a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-bound enzyme involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a post hoc analysis of a controlled trial with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) on haemodialysis, we examined the association between baseline and change by measuring baseline LpPLA2 activity on cardiovascular events (CVE) and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS:   LpPLA2 activity was available of 1202 patients at baseline and 6 months after randomisation from 1255 patients in the German <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Dialysis Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the 4-year follow-up, 445 patients (37%) suffered from CVE and 583 patients (49%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest quartile of LpPLA2 activity (≥615 U/L) was associated with elevated risk for CVE [HR 1·35 (1·02-1·87); P = 0·035] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association was mainly driven by the placebo group [HR 1·51 (1·01-2·25); P = 0·046] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristics analysis revealed that including LpPLA2 activity in an already adjusted model increased the area under the curve (AUC) for CVE from 0·586 (0·553-0·620) to 0·632 (0·599-0·664; P = 0·020) and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from 0·704 (0·674-0·733) to 0·708 (0·679-0·737; P = 0·026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-treated patients, the decrease in LpPLA2 was associated with reduced fatal risk [HR per standard deviation 0·74 (0·62-0·90); P = 0·002], an effect not seen in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, those patients in the placebo group presenting a &gt; 25% decrease in LpPLA2 activity (n = 33) had a more than doubled risk of dying [HR 2·48 (1·56-3·95); P &lt; 0·001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   LpPLA2 activity is predictive for cardiovascular outcome and total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reducing LpPLA2 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> was associated with reduced mortality in patients with T2D on haemodialysis </plain></SENT>
