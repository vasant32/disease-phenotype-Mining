<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings may ultimately lead to novel treatment options for disease prevention or delaying progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two major paradigms jointly underlie the development of T2D and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These paradigms include the genetic risk variants and behavioral/environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article systematically reviews the literature supporting genetic determinants in the pathogenesis of T2D and diabetic vasculopathy, and the functional implications of these gene variants on the regulation of beta-cell function and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We update the discovery of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic vasculopathy risk variants, and describe the genetic technologies that have uncovered them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, genomic linkage between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and T2D is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is a complementary role for behavioral and environmental factors modulating the genetic susceptibility and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological and clinical data demonstrating the effects of behavioral and novel environmental exposures on disease expression are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, a succinct overview of recent landmark clinical trials addressing glycemic control and its impact on rates of vascular complications is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is expected that novel strategies to exploit the gene- and exposure-related underpinnings of T2D will soon result </plain></SENT>
