<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine if the relationship between insulin initiation and glycemic control among veterans with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) varies by the number of oral-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering-medication classes used prior to insulin initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cohort consisted of veterans with T2DM with at least two glycosolated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobins</z:chebi> (A1c) â‰¥8.0% within a 12-month period but without prior insulin use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study period was October 1998 until May 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analyses were used to assess the predictors of the rate of insulin initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 40,537 who met the inclusion criteria, 17,519 (43.2%) had insulin initiated over a median follow-up period of 58.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of insulin initiation due to 1% increase in A1c increased by 33.6%, 28.8%, 24.2%, 19.7%, 15.4% for patients exposed to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 classes of oral-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher insulin initiation rate was also associated with younger age, more comorbidities, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, longer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and attending endocrinology clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poor glycemic control is associated with increased rates of insulin initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This relationship is attenuated by the number of distinct oral-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering-medication classes used prior to insulin initiation </plain></SENT>
