<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple common variants in TMPRSS6 were significantly associated with serum iron in recent genome-wide association studies, but their effects in the Chinese remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether the TMPRSS6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs855791(V736A) and rs4820268(D521D) were associated with blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and plasma ferritin concentrations and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The SNPs rs855791(V736A) and rs4820268(D521D) in the TMPRSS6 gene were genotyped and tested for their associations with plasma iron and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in 1574 unrelated Chinese Hans from Beijing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 TMPRSS6 SNPs rs855791(V736A) and rs4820268(D521D) were both significantly associated with plasma ferritin (P ≤ 0.0058), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (P ≤ 0.0013), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> risk (P ≤ 0.0068), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (P ≤ 0.0314) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the associations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> or plasma ferritin remained significant (P ≥ 0.1229) when the 2 variants were both included in one linear regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A haplotype carrying both iron-lowering alleles from the 2 TMPRSS SNPs showed significant associations with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (P = 0.0014), lower plasma ferritin (P = 0.0027), and a reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> (P = 0.0017) and of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.0277) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that TMPRSS6 variants were significantly associated with plasma ferritin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese Hans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk conferred by the TMPRSS6 SNPs is possibly mediated by plasma ferritin </plain></SENT>
