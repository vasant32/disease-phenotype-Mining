<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal data from a population-based study were used to separate the phenotypic effects of MC4R deficiency during childhood and adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MC4R exon was sequenced in 6,760 individuals of predominantly Pima Indian heritage, and discovered mutations were functionally assessed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects on BMI, height, and slope of BMI change were assessed during childhood (ages 5-20 years) and adulthood (ages 20-45 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six mutations affecting MC4R function, including three that may be private to Pima Indians, were found in 159 individuals (2.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The slope of BMI increase was greater in individuals carrying an MC4R mutation compared with noncarriers during childhood but not during adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final adult height obtained was higher in individuals with MC4R deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an increased risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals with a defective MC4R during childhood and adulthood, but this was only independent of BMI in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The greater rates of body mass accumulation and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before the age of 20 years in individuals with MC4R deficiency indicate that the effects of these mutations are more apparent during the active growth of childhood </plain></SENT>
