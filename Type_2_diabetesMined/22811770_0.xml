<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional and a case control study designs were used to assess the prevalence and risk factors respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the prevalence study a sample of 699 diabetic subjects were selected randomly from two polyclinics in Al-Dakhiliyah region; Sumail and Nizwa polyclinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the case control study, a sample consisting of 215 cases and 358 controls were randomly selected from those who were included in the cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A well designed questionnaire has been used to collect data regarding the disease and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data was analyzed using SPSS19 statistical program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was calculated as 42.5% (95% C.I: 38.83% - 46.15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in the prevalence in the two polyclinic catchment area was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was significantly higher among males (51.6%) compared to females (36.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Crude analysis of the risk factors showed significant association between diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and the following factors; male gender, decreased literacy, long duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, family history of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, poor glycemic control (high HbA1c), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed the following factors to be independent risk factors; male gender, decreased literacy, long duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, family history of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and poor glycaemic control (high HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in this study was 42.5% and the significant risk factors associated with it included male gender, decreased literacy, long duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, family history of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and poor glycemic control (high HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
