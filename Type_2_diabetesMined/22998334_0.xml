<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translational studies have assessed the impact of interventions based on, but less intensive than, trial protocols delivered in community settings with high-risk populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review was to synthesize evidence from translational studies of any design to assess the impact of interventions delivered outside large randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical and scientific databases were searched using specified inclusion and exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were included that used a tested <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> preventive study protocol with an adult population at risk from Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Included papers were quality assessed and data extracted using recommended methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From an initial 793 papers, 19 papers reporting 17 studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Translational studies from a range of settings utilized a variety of methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were based on the US <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Programme protocol or the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study, with modifications that increased feasibility and access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main outcome that was reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies was weight change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo>, which occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one study, was greater in intervention arms than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No consistent differences were found in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Translational studies based on the intensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programmes showed that there is potential for less intensive interventions both to be feasible and to have an impact on future progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in at-risk individuals. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
