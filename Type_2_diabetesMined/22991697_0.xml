<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates in diabetic patients are higher than in the general population and their prognosis following any cardiovascular event is generally worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 1 diabetic patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications-related mortality decreases with time and the interval free from the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> until the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications is larger although global mortality is still higher than that of sex- and age matched healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of better primary and secondary prevention, recent data in the general population show that there is a trend towards decreased cardiovascular events and increased life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same thing applies for type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, increased survival in the general population associated to epidemic bursts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and sedentary lifestyle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the globe, leads to a higher incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worldwide </plain></SENT>
