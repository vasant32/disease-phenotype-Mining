<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an analysis of data from a nonrandomized, prospective, controlled study, we examined the effects of bariatric surgery on the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this analysis, we included 1658 patients who underwent bariatric surgery and 1771 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> matched controls (with matching performed on a group, rather than individual, level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the participants had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the bariatric-surgery cohort underwent banding (19%), vertical banded gastroplasty (69%), or gastric bypass (12%); nonrandomized, matched, prospective controls received usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants were 37 to 60 years of age, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34 or more in men and 38 or more in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis focused on the rate of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which was a prespecified secondary end point in the main study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the time of this analysis (January 1, 2012), participants had been followed for up to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite matching, some baseline characteristics differed significantly between the groups; the baseline body weight was higher and risk factors were more pronounced in the bariatric-surgery group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 15 years, 36.2% of the original participants had dropped out of the study, and 30.9% had not yet reached the time for their 15-year follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed in 392 participants in the control group and in 110 in the bariatric-surgery group, corresponding to incidence rates of 28.4 cases per 1000 person-years and 6.8 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio with bariatric surgery, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.21; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect of bariatric surgery was influenced by the presence or absence of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P=0.002 for the interaction) but not by BMI (P=0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses, including end-point imputations, did not change the overall conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The postoperative mortality was 0.2%, and 2.8% of patients who underwent bariatric surgery required reoperation within 90 days owing to complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery appears to be markedly more efficient than usual care in the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> persons </plain></SENT>
