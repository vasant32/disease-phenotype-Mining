<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between skin autofluorescence and vascular complications in non-Caucasian patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects in this cross-sectional study comprised 130 Japanese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skin advanced glycation end products were assessed by skin autofluorescence using an autofluorescence reader </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association between skin autofluorescence and severity of vascular complications was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 130 patients, 60 (46.2%) had microvascular complications such as diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, 10 (7.7%) had macrovascular complications and 63 (48.5%) had micro- and/or macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skin autofluorescence increased with severity of vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent determinants of skin autofluorescence were age (β = 0.24, P &lt; 0.01), mean HbA(1c) in previous year (β = 0.17, P = 0.03), microvascular complications (β = 0.44, P &lt; 0.01) and macrovascular complications (β = 0.27, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (odds ratio 1.15, P &lt; 0.01), systolic blood pressure (odds ratio 1.04, P = 0.01), skin autofluorescence (odds ratio 3.62, P = 0.01) and serum albumin (odds ratio 0.84, P &lt; 0.01) were independent factors for the presence of vascular complications in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Skin autofluorescence had independent effects on vascular complications in Japanese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This indicates that skin advanced glycation end products are a surrogate marker for vascular risk and a non-invasive autofluorescence reader may be a useful tool to detect high-risk cases in non-Caucasian patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
