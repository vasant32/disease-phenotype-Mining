<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although traditionally used as a final treatment option, early use of insulin is a therapeutic option after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> failure in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Injection of native insulin lacks the rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action after food ingestion and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> maintenance of a steady-state low-level basal insulin in fasting periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These limitations have fuelled the development of insulin analogues, which mainly fall into two different categories: short-acting and long-acting analogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: We review the recent literature investigating the efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with emphasis on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as about 30% of these patients are being treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examine novel developments in this area, including the new long-acting basal analogues whose longer duration of action might reduce dosing frequency to three times a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Insulin analogues show some advantage compared with native insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, improvements in reducing their pharmacological variability would be expected to lower the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, as well as to simplify and perhaps also encourage optimal insulin titration in real-life clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extending the duration of insulin effect would also allow for greater flexibility and potentially reduce the frequency of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
