<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A previous study in type 2 diabetic patients with high-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body lead burdens showed that EDTA chelation therapy for 3 months slows progressive diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> during a 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of a longer course of therapy on kidney function decrease over a longer follow-up is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month run-in phase, then a randomized single-blind study with a 27-month intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: University medical center; 50 patients (serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, 1.5-3.9 mg/dL) with high-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body lead burden (≥80-&lt;600 μg) were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The treatment group received weekly chelation therapy for 3 months to reduce their body lead burden to &lt;60 μg and then as needed for 24 months to maintain this level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group received placebo for 3 months and then weekly for 5 weeks at 6-month intervals for 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: The primary end point was change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A secondary end point was a 2-fold increase in baseline serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level or the requirement for renal replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Body lead burdens were assessed by EDTA mobilization tests and eGFR was calculated using the equation for Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean baseline eGFRs in the treatment and control groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of chelation therapy, the change in eGFR in the treatment group (+1.0±4.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) differed significantly from that in the control group (-1.5±4.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent 24-month intervention, the yearly rate of decrease in eGFR (5.6±5.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year) in the treatment group was slower than that (9.2±3.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year; P = 0.04) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>17 (68%) control-group patients and 9 (36%) treatment-group patients achieved the secondary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, not double blind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A 27-month course of EDTA chelation therapy retards the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients with high-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body lead burdens </plain></SENT>
