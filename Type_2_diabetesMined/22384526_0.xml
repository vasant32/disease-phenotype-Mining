<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are potential risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> binding cassette transporter proteins 1 (ABCA1) plays a role in cholesterol metabolism, especially <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are multiple mechanisms by which <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> can be atheroprotective, it is clear that the relative activity of ABCA1 plays a major role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate association of ABCA1 C69T gene polymorphism with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels in Turkish type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: After isolation of DNA by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> precipitation we determined ABCA1 gene polymorphism by using polimerase chain reaction--restriction fragment lenght polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 107 type 2 diabetic patients and 50 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have observed that the frequency of TT genotype is significantly higher in healthy controls compared to patients (14% vs. 3%; P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also frequency of T allele was higher in controls than in patients (34% vs. 21%; P = 0.020; OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.30-0.88)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and ABCA1 C69T polymorphism subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have found significantly higher frequency of both T allele and genotype in control group when compared to patients that made us think that T allele may be a protective factor against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But, we could not find a relationship between genotypes and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations in our two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Larger studies will help us to understand the relationship between ABCA1 C69T genotype and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
