<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: This study was based on data obtained from the KNHANES 2008-2009, which was conducted for 3 years (2007-2009) using a rolling sampling design that involved a complex, stratified, multistage, probability-cluster survey of a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: We showed that serum 25(OH)D concentration is inversely associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Korean general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, low serum 25(OH)D concentration was associated with an increased prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young women and old men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that 25(OH)D has a significant negative association with fasting insulin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The age- and gender-specific association between low 25(OH)D level and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be related to interactions between <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> concentrations, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we showed that low 25(OH)D concentration is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Korean general population in an age- and gender-specific pattern </plain></SENT>
