<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The setting is institutional setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 82 patients were recruited for this study, and a healthy control group matched according to age and gender was recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent acoustic analysis and perceptual evaluation using the GRABS classification where G stands for grading, R for roughness, A for asthenia, B for breathiness, and S for straining using a scale of 0â€“3 where o stands for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and three for severe deviation from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in any of the acoustic variables between diabetic patients and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the mean score of any of the perceptual evaluation parameters between diabetic patients and control, despite the fact that the mean scores were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher in the diseased group except for roughness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When looking at subgroups, we see that diabetic patients with poor glycemic control and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> had significantly higher mean score for the G overall grade of the voice compared to controls with P values of 0.005 and 0.009, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>What is also worth noting is that diabetic patients with poor glycemic control had more straining compared to controls, P value 0.043 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and poor glycemic control or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> have a significant difference in the grade of their voice compared to controls </plain></SENT>
