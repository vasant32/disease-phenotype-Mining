<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serologic-HCV testing was performed in 489 type 2 DM patients (303 outpatients and 186 on dialysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A structured assessment of clinical, laboratory and DM-related complications was performed and the patients were then compared according to HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 60 years; HCV positivity (HCV+) was observed in 39 of 303 (12.9%) outpatients and in 34 of 186 (18.7%) dialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among HCV+ patients, 32 were men (43.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HCV+ patients had higher serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (0.90 ± 0.83 vs 0.35 ± 0.13 µKat/L), alanine aminotransferase (0.88 ± 0.93 vs 0.38 ± 0.19 µKat/L), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transferase (1.57 ± 2.52 vs 0.62 ± 0.87 µKat/L; P &lt; 0.001), and serum iron (17.65 ± 6.68 vs 14.96 ± 4.72 µM; P = 0.011), and lower leukocyte and platelet counts (P = 0.010 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) than HCV-negative (HCV-) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HCV+ dialysis patients had higher diastolic blood pressure than HCV- patients (87.5 ± 6.7 vs 81.5 ± 6.0 mmHg; P = 0.005) and a lower prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (75 vs 92.7%; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study showed that HCV is common among subjects with type 2 DM but is not associated with a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
