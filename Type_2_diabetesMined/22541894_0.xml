<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet the best regimen to prescribe to patients transitioning from oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs (OADs) is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare the effects of two standard initial insulin strategies (basal insulin alone versus premixed insulin) on post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and precursors of advanced glycation end-products in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suboptimally controlled on OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a 6-month, open-label, single-center study using a cross-over design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>14 subjects were randomized to one of two protocols: once daily insulin glargine or twice-daily 75%/25% neutral protamine lispro/lispro mix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 12 weeks, the subjects were crossed-over to the opposite protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During each period, insulin doses were titrated to target fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 90-110 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after the two 12-week treatment periods, subjects were studied in the Clinical Research Center; they consumed three liquid mixed isocaloric meals at 4-h intervals, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, free fatty acids (FFA), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and α-dicarbonyls (3-deoxyglucosone [3-DG] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">methylglyoxal</z:chebi> [MG]) were measured before and after each meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient data were analyzed in the context of their assigned insulin strategy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Both insulin regimens led to a significant improvement in glycemic profiles, including fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c, compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, mean post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was lower with lispro mix than with glargine (153 ± 36 vs. 199 ± 49 mg/dL, respectively; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Likewise, there was a reduction in both fasting (48 ± 13 vs. 57 ± 19, P=0.047) and post-prandial (53 ± 19 vs. 63 ± 23; P=0.007) 3DG levels with lispro mix as compared to glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No differences were noted in MG concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients failing OAD therapy, an initial insulin regimen of twice daily premixed insulin results in significantly improved post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels as well as a reduction in a precursor of AGEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The effect of these two initial insulin regimens on long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> requires further study </plain></SENT>
