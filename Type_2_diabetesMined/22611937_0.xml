<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed high-sugar and high-fat diet after 8 weeks, then inject <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> intraperitoneally according to 25 mg/kgbw dose to establish animal models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and fed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6182">L-arabinose</z:chebi> according to a low dose (50 mg/kgbw ), medium dose (150 mg/kgbw) and high dose (500 mg/kgbw) ,the animal be fed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> (20 mg/kgbw) as a positive control, the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6182">L-arabinose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> were prepared in the dextrin (0.36 g/ml) and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> (0.04 g/ml) of the suspension, free to eat water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OGTT after 4 weeks, After animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, rat liver, epididymal fat and cecum were weighed and calculate the ratio of organ weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results compared with model group, low, animals with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6182">L-arabinose</z:chebi>-intervention those blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response had a significant impact, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values and AUC were significantly lower than the model group (P &lt; 0.05), of which medium dose is most significant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6182">L-arabinose</z:chebi> intervention increased cecal weight and showed protective effect on beta-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6182">L-arabinose</z:chebi> long-term intervention can improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in type 2 diabetic rats, this effect may be related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6182">L-arabinose</z:chebi> inhibition of digestive enzymes and the protective effect on beta-cell </plain></SENT>
