<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether they have a higher incidence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, whether insulin use in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be associated with a higher incidence of HP eradication has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reimbursement databases from 1996 to 2005 of 1 million insurants of the National Health Insurance in Taiwan were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After excluding those aged &lt;25 years, cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, cases receiving HP eradication before 2005, patients with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and those with unknown living region, the reimbursement data of a total of 601,441 insurants were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status and insulin use in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before 2005 were the main exposures of interest and the first event of HP eradication in 2005 was the main outcome evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HP eradication was defined as a combination use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2 receptor blockers</z:chebi>, plus clarithromycin or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6909">metronidazole</z:chebi>, plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2676">amoxicillin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>, with or without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33301">bismuth</z:chebi>, in the same prescription for 7-14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/insulin use and HP eradication was evaluated by logistic regression, considering the confounding effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, comorbidities, medications and panendoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2005, there were 10,051 incident cases receiving HP eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HP eradication was significantly increased with age, male sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, insulin use, use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, panendoscopic examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were also seen for occupation and living region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Medications including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>, fibrate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi>/angiotensin receptor blocker and oral anti-diabetic agents were not associated with HP eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratios for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin use and use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> was 1.133 (1.074, 1.195), 1.414 (1.228, 1.629) and 1.147 (1.074, 1.225), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and insulin use in the diabetic patients are significantly associated with a higher incidence of HP eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> also shows a significant association with HP eradication </plain></SENT>
