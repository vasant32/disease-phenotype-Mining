<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to analyze islet cell composition in diabetic islets for the process of transforming water-soluble IAPP in β-cells to water-insoluble amyloid deposits by Immunocytochemical staining using different dilutions of anti-IAPP antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IAPP in β-cell granules may initiate β-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> through <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to form interstitial amyloid deposits in type 2 diabetic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Control islets revealed twice as much β-cells as α-cells whereas 15 of 18 type 2 diabetic cases (83%) revealed α- cells as major cells in larger islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic islets consisted of more larger islets with more σ-cells than β-cells, which contribute to hyperglucagonemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In control islets, percentage of IAPP-positive cells against β-cells was 40-50% whereas percentage for type 2 diabetic islets was about 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amyloid deposits in diabetic islets were not readily immunostained for IAPP using 1: 800 diluted antibody, however, 1: 400 and 1: 200 diluted solutions provided stronger immunostaining in early stages of islet amyloidogenesis after treating the deparaffinized sections with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using commercially available rabbit antihuman IAPP antibody, immunocytochemical staining was performed on 18 cases of pancreatic tissues from type 2 diabetic subjects by systematically immunostaining for insulin, glucagon, somatostatin (SRIF) and IAPP compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sizes of islets were measured by 1 cm scale, mounted in 10X eye piece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: α cells were major islet cells in majority of diabetic pancreas (83%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic islets contained less IAPP-positive cells than controls, indicating that IAPP deficiency in pancreatic islets is responsible for decreased IAPP in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In diabetic islets, water-soluble IAPP disappeared in β-cell granules, which transformed to water-insoluble amyloid deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Amyloid deposits were not readily immunostained using IAPP 1: 800 diluted antibody but were stronger immunostained for IAPP in early stages of amyloid deposited islets using less diluted solutions after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In early islet amyloidogenesis, dying β-cell cytoplasm was adjacently located to fine amyloid fibrils, supporting that IAPP in secretary granules from dying β cells served as nidus for islet β-sheet formation </plain></SENT>
