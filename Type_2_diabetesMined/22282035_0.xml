<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This article examines the relationship among <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related stress, appraisal, coping and depressive symptoms in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) using the transactional model of stress and coping (TMSC) as the theoretical framework </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this cross-sectional study, a convenience sample of 201 patients with T2DM was recruited from three outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with depressive symptoms reported significantly more <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related stress than patients without depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of path analysis suggest that patients who experience greater <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related stress or greater depressive symptoms have a negative appraisal of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Negative appraisal is, in turn, associated with greater use of avoidance, passive resignation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> integration coping and lesser use of problem-focused coping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Avoidance, passive resignation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> integration coping are, in turn, related to greater depressive symptoms or greater <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the results of this study support the TMSC as a framework to elucidate the relationships among <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related stress, appraisal, coping and depressive symptoms in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, given the cross-sectional nature of the study, we are unable to elucidate the directionality of the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implications of the findings and the need for longitudinal studies to evaluate these relationships are discussed </plain></SENT>
