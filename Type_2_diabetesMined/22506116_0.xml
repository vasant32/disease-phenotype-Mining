<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic myotubes express a primary reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) cycle flux but at present it is unclear in which part of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle the defect is localised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to localise the defect we studied ATP production in isolated mitochondria from substrates entering the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle at various points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATP production was measured by luminescence with or without concomitant ATP utilisation by hexokinase in mitochondria isolated from myotubes established from eight lean and eight type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ATP production of investigated substrate combinations was significantly reduced in mitochondria isolated from type 2 diabetic subjects compared to lean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when ATP synthesis rates at different substrate combinations were normalized to the corresponding individual <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>-malate rate, there was no significant difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that the primary reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle flux in diabetic myotubes is not explained by defects in specific part of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle but rather results from a general downregulation of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle </plain></SENT>
