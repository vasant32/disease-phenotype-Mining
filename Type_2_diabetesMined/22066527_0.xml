<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study compared the health and economic benefits of saxagliptin versus insulin as second-line therapy with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (SU) after failure of the respective monotherapies for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was assessed using a previously published <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease progression, utilities, and effects of changes in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), weight, and hypoglycemic events were taken from published studies, and Polish sources were used where possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MET + saxagliptin reduced severe hypoglycemic complications and weight versus MET + insulin, with an incremental benefit of 0.13 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 27,454 Polish zloty (PLN) ($9,966 U.S.) per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SU + saxagliptin showed an incremental benefit of 0.14 QALYs and ICER of 24,663 PLN ($8,953 U.S.) per QALY gained versus SU + insulin, with reduced incidence of symptomatic and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were most sensitive to disutilities associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, injection fear, HbA1c changes, threshold for switching treatment, and patients' age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were robust to various model assumptions and inputs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 100,000 PLN ($36,300 U.S.) per QALY gained, the probability that saxagliptin is cost-effective in these analyses was 74% (MET) and 76% (SU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin in combination with MET or SU is likely to represent a cost-effective treatment option in Polish patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> failing first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
