<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: A decline in physical activity has been shown to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS), leading to cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this is difficult to manage well in the elderly with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the correlation between physical activity and clinical parameters in the presence and absence of MetS in Japanese elderly subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined which factor, calorie intake or physical activity, mainly contributes to the prevalence of MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 846 consecutive Japanese elderly (408 men and 438 women, mean age 68.7 years) was carried out at the time of enrolment (2000-2002) in the Japanese Elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their level of physical activity was evaluated using the Baecke questionnaire, consisting of three components: work, sports and leisure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total activity score (TAS) as the sum of each activity score was divided into four quartiles (Q1 to Q4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ResulTS: After adjustment for age and sex, there was a positive association of TAS with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, although no significant correlation between other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters and TAS was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin level and physical measurements, such as waist circumference, waist/hip ratio and body mass index, were inversely associated with TAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although no correlation between TAS and cognitive function Mini-Mental State Examination was found, TAS was positively associated with instrumental ADL and negatively associated with geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score (GDS), suggesting that a decline in physical activity in the elderly is associated with depressed mood rather than a decline of cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total calorie intake appeared to increase according to TAS; however, this did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a subanalysis comparing the presence and absence of MetS, the TAS grade in the MetS group was significantly lower than that in the non-MetS group, although there was no significant difference in total calorie intake between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results showed that lower physical activity, but not excessive calorie intake, is independently associated with the prevalence of MetS in the elderly with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our routine work, encouraging physical activity might contribute to preventing MetS and subsequent atherosclerotic disease in the elderly, rather than strict management of abnormal laboratory parameters using multiple drugs </plain></SENT>
