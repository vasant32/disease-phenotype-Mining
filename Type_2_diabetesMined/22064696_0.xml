<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed in order to examine the prevalence of CAD in a cohort of asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk and negative nuclear imaging, using multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 770 type 2 diabetic patients were screened from January 2008 through July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 132 Caucasians with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and asymptomatic for <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> were eligible for a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent MSCT after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was excluded by myocardial Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">Photon</z:chebi> Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) at rest and after dynamic exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When obstructive plaques were found (≥ 50% lumen narrowing), patients were sent to conventional coronary angiography (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six subjects were not included in the analysis because of motion artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSCT was positive for CAD in 114 patients (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within patients with positive MSCT, 60 (48% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) showed one or more obstructive plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CCA confirmed significant stenosis (≥ 50%) in 48 of these 60 patients (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some 21 (35%) showed stenosis ≥ 75% and were submitted to the revascularisation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MSCT seems to better identify CAD than myocardial SPECT in asymptomatic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
