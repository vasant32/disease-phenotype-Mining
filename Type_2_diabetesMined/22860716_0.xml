<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>Obsessive- compulsive disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e>) symptomatology and depressive symptomatology with the metabolic profile of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-one diabetic patients were randomly selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first assessment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants completed the Zung Self Rating Scale (ZUNG) and the Maudsley O-C Inventory Questionnaire (MOCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, diabetic patients that were initially uncontrolled (n = 31) (HbA1c &gt; 7) were re-evaluated by the same psychometric tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From those 31 patients, 10 had managed to control their metabolic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the first evaluation MOCI and the sub-scale of slowness were statistically related with the diabetic profile (controlled, HbA1c ≤ 7; uncontrolled, HbA1c &gt; 7), with uncontrolled patients scoring significantly higher on the overall MOCI score and the factor of slowness of MOCI scale (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed a positive association between depressive symptomatology (P = 0.004) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive disorder</z:hpo> symptomatology (P &lt; 0.001) and the metabolic profile of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the second evaluation the patients that managed to control their metabolic profile scored lower in both ZDRS and MOCI, although these differences in scores failed to reach significance levels were indicative of a tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present results provide initial evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive disorder</z:hpo> symptomatology and depressive symptomatology </plain></SENT>
