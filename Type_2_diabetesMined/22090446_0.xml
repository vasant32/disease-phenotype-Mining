<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Type 2 diabetic patients, clinical diagnosis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) is generally based on the concomitant presence of abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this high-risk population, cardiovascular (CV) outcome has never been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 742 Type 2 diabetic patients with DN from 17 national centres was selected by the presence of persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> ≥ 30 mg/day and severe diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and was followed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time to CV event (CV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, revascularization, major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>) was the primary composite end point and it was analysed by multivariable Cox's proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction between <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was specifically investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 4.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall 242 events (26% of which fatal) were observed in 202 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CV events increased from 19 to 40% as GFR declined from the highest (≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) to the lowest (&lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) category and was equal to 25 and 33% in <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and macroalbuminuria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, the interaction between <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and GFR was statistically significant (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp>, indeed, had a remarkable prognostic effect in subjects with high GFR that virtually disappeared as GFR became &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, smoking habit, previous occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found to have a statistically significant prognostic effect on CV outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A clinically based diagnosis of DN in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> allows the identification of subjects with high CV risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> has a relevant prognostic effect on CV morbidity and mortality; its effect is especially pronounced when GFR is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
