<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between ferritin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in different gender and ethnicities remains uncertain; this study aimed to investigate it using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), and to explore whether it is gender-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: A total of 524 type 2 diabetic patients were selected cross-sectionally from a cohort participating in a diabetic control study in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Result: Overall, tertiles of ferritin were significantly and dose-dependently associated with elevated fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, HOMA-IR levels as well as Western dietary pattern scores generated by factor analysis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p trend &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratified by gender, a 1-tertile ferritin increase significantly correlated with a 0.241-unit increase in HOMA-IR (beta = 0.241, p = 0.001) in female <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but not in male <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (beta = 0.072, p = 0.232), after adjusting for demographic, dietary, clinical and inflammatory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Iron overload</z:e>, which produces elevated levels of ferritin, may augment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in female but not in male type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies are warranted to establish relationships between iron stores and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development in men and women of different ethnicities </plain></SENT>
