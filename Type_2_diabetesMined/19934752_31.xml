<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To develop guidelines for the use of gastrointestinal surgery to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to craft an agenda for further research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence demonstrates that bariatric surgery can dramatically ameliorate type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Not surprisingly, gastrointestinal operations are now being used throughout the world to treat <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and increasingly, for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the role for surgery in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment is not clearly defined and there are neither clear guidelines for these practices nor sufficient plans for clinical trials to evaluate the risks and benefits of such "<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> surgery." METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of 50 voting delegates from around the world gathered in Rome, Italy for the first International Conference on Gastrointestinal Surgery to Treat Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>--(the "<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Surgery Summit") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the meeting, available scientific evidence was examined and critiqued by the entire group to assess the strength of evidence and to draft consensus statements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through an iterative process, draft statements were then serially discussed, debated, edited, reassessed, and finally presented for formal voting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the Rome meeting, statements that achieved consensus were summarized and distributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> voting delegates for further input and final approval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These statements were then formally critiqued by representatives of several sientific societies at the 1st World Congress on Interventional Therapies for T2DM (New York, Sept 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Input from this discussion was used to generate the current position statement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Surgery Summit (DSS) Position Statement consists of recommendations for clinical and research issues, as well as general concepts and definitions in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The DSS recognizes the legitimacy of surgical approaches to treat <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in carefully selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For example, gastric bypass was deemed a reasonable treatment option for patients with poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a body mass index &gt; or =30 kg/m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials to investigate the exact role of surgery in patients with less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are considered a priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, investigations on the mechanisms of surgical control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are strongly encouraged, as they may help advance the understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DSS consensus document embodies the foundations of "<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> surgery," and represents a timely attempt by leading scholars to improve access to surgical options supported by sound evidence, while also preventing harm from inappropriate use of unproven procedures </plain></SENT>
