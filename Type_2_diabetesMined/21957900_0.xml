<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 306 pregnancies complicated by Type 1 and 55 by Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics delivering <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large for gestational age</z:hpo> (LGA) infants was 42% and 49%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 49% and 55% were A-LGA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-pregnancy BMI was not associated with increased odds of delivering an A-LGA newborn in women with Type 1 or 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in Type 1 diabetics, each one-pound increase in maternal weight during pregnancy resulted in 4% increased odds of delivering an A-LGA newborn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For Type 2 diabetics, the odds of delivering an A-LGA infant was decreased by 10% for each 0.1 unit/kg increase in insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although there is a known association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and LGA in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we found that overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women with Type 1 or Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> do not have increased odds of delivering an A-LGA newborn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, insulin dose in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly associated with the odds of delivering an A-LGA neonate </plain></SENT>
