<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 102 consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the course of 10 months in a subspecialty practice undergoing 3-day blinded CGM using the iPRO(™) device (Medtronic, Northridge, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels were measured prior to and up to 7 months after the CGM procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before blinded CGM the average <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c level was 7.7±1.0%, and after it was 7.8±1.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These values are not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis of subjects using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion treatment also failed to show a significant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c difference pre- and post-CGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using the iPro device for short-term (professional) blinded CGM in an office setting to improve <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels may not be a feasible goal for patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expectations of benefit, choice of patient, and choice of technology for short-term CGM are factors requiring careful consideration before testing takes place </plain></SENT>
