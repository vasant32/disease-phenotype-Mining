<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the association of glycemic control with CEC and endothelial function in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM).We studied 30 patients with type 2 DM and 20 age and sex matched healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Number of circulating endothelial cells was measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was studied by measuring flow mediated vasodilation (FMD%) in the brachial artery and serum level of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO).CEC count was significantly elevated in patients with DM, than HC (35.3±15.1 vs. 7.3±2.4, p&lt;0.001) and in patients with HbA1c&gt;7 than patients with HbA1c≤7 (47.4±5.5 vs. 19.5±5.7, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FMD% and NO were lower in DM patients than HC (3.5±0.85 vs. 9.5±3.1, p&lt;0.001 and 37.8±6.1 vs. 64.1±5.7, p&lt;0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FMD% and NO were lower in patients with HbA1c&gt;7 as compared to patients with HA1c≤7 (2.8±0.4 vs. 4.3±0.4, p&lt;0.001 and 33.1±2.9 vs. 43.9±2.8, respectively, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1c correlated negatively with FMD% and NO levels and positively with CEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CEC count correlated negatively with FMD% and NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation between CEC count and HBA1c (p&lt;0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> correlations).CEC is associated with markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and disease control in patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a potential role of CEC in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in type 2 diabetic and raise the importance of tight glycemic control </plain></SENT>
