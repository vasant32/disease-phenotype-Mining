<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methodology: Forty-five type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients underwent modified Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at WeiFang People's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on patient demographics, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), body mass index (BMI), medication use, remission and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) were prospectively collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: At 6 months after surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these 45 patients obtained remission or a marked improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FPG was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in 39 (86.7%) patients stopping medicine treatment for their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients (13.3%) had an obvious reduced abnormal FPG and they only required lower drug dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> groups (p=0.311) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean BMI dropped from 28.9±3.0kg/m2 to 27.4±2.8kg/m2 (p=0.000) at the third month and 26.3±2.5kg/m2 (p=0.000) at the sixth month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA1c decreased from their preoperative values of 7.4%±2.2% to 6.3%±1.5% (p=0.000) at the third month and 5.1%±0.9% (p=0.000) at the sixth month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Modified Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was effective in treating type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, independent of body mass index </plain></SENT>
