<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to confirm the possible association in Europeans and to examine the interaction between one gene variant and clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 C-to-T polymorphism was genotyped in 211 LADA, 1,297 type 2 diabetic, 545 type 1 diabetic and 1,497 control individuals from Hungary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of our and previously published studies was performed to evaluate the size and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the gene effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The meta-analysis yielded a significant effect of TCF7L2 T allele (OR 1.28; p &lt; 0.0001) on LADA risk without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T allele conferred equally strong susceptibility to LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the Hungarian dataset, the T allele was associated with LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but not with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T allele carriers had significantly lower BMI than patients with the CC genotype in the LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups (p = 0.0021 and p = 0.0013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both diseases, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was significantly higher in the non-overweight than in the overweight BMI category (p = 0.0013 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively); susceptibility to LADA was increased by 2.84-fold in non-overweight individuals compared with overweight ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The meta-analysis demonstrates that TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism is a population-independent susceptibility locus for LADA in Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect size is similar for LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The gene effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk may be modulated by BMI, such that the lower the BMI, the higher the gene effect </plain></SENT>
