<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eligible Japanese men and women (1,771) aged 40-70 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 59 institutes nationwide were followed for a planned 8-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The performance of eight conventional <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> variables, i.e., total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TGs), non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi>, TC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> ratio, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> ratio, and TG/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> ratio, as predictors of incident CHD were evaluated by four methods: hazard ratio (HR) per one SD increment by multivariate Cox analysis, Ï‡(2) likelihood ratio test, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and tertile analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables significantly predicted CHD events in men, non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> (HR per one SD 1.78 [95% CI 1.43-2.21]; AUC 0.726) and TC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> (HR 1.63 [1.36-1.95]; AUC 0.718) had the better predictive performances among the variables, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In women, TGs (log-transformed; HR 1.72 [1.21-2.43]; AUC 0.708) were the best predictor according to results of tertile analysis (HR of the top tertile versus the bottom tertile 4.31 [1.53-12.16]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The associations with incident CHD were linear and continuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For Japanese diabetic men, non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> and TC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> were the best predictors, whereas TGs were most predictive for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings, which included prominent sex differences, should be considered among clinical approaches to risk reduction among East Asians with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
