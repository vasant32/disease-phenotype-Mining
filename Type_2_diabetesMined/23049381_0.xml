<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The same blood samples were also evaluated using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> B micronucleus assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the results of the two assays is presented here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Whole blood samples were collected from 22 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients on hemodialysis and from 22 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected from patients early in the morning on Mondays, before the first weekly hemodialysis session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN) was used to evaluate genomic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of micronuclei and nuclear buds were higher in patients than in controls (p-value = 0.001 and p-value &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between the frequency of micronuclei and DNA damage with the results of the comet assay (p-value &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in the frequency of micronuclei and nuclear buds between patients and controls was more pronounced in the group with higher median comet values than in the group with lower comet values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the increased rates of DNA damage as measured by the comet assay and influenced by the weekly routine therapy of these patients has a mutagenic effect, thereby increasing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in this group </plain></SENT>
