<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether plasma and urinary angiotensinogen levels were associated with renal and cardiovascular prognosis in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured plasma and urinary angiotensinogen levels in the observational follow-up cohort of 234 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (144 with normoalbuminuria, 90 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>) enrolled between 1998 and 1999 and followed them up until the end of 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations of these markers with the annual decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and incidence of renal and cardiovascular composite endpoints (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodialysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, urinary angiotensinogen levels correlated with urinary albumin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, urinary Î²(2)-microglobulin and inversely with eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, plasma angiotensinogen levels correlated neither with these renal factors nor with urinary angiotensinogen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up study (median duration: 9 years), urinary angiotensinogen, but not plasma angiotensinogen, correlated inversely with the annual change in eGFR (r = -0.51, P &lt; 0.001).When patients were divided into four subgroups according to <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and urinary angiotensinogen levels, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and high urinary angiotensinogen levels showed a progressive decline of eGFR and a higher incidence of renal and cardiovascular composite endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the higher level of urinary angiotensinogen in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> is a high risk factor for worsening renal and cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
