<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incretin hormone-based treatments for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> represent a major advance in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability of the incretin agents (glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 [GLP-1] <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DPP-4] inhibitors) to improve glycaemia with a low associated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, together with beneficial/neutral effects on body weight, offers a significant advantage for both patients and treating clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this edition of 'Then and Now,' it is useful to look back 25 years and reflect upon the developments in this field since Nauck and colleagues published two seminal papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1986 they first documented a reduced incretin effect in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (Diabetologia 29:46-52), and then in 1993 they demonstrated that, in patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a single exogenous infusion of an incretin (GLP-1) increased insulin levels in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent manner and normalised fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (Diabetologia 36:741-744) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ensuing 26 years, progress in the field of incretin hormones has resulted in a greater understanding of the relative roles of GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> secretion and activity in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the important recognition that native GLP-1 is quickly degraded by the ubiquitous protease DPP-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This has led to the development of GLP-1 agonists that are resistant to degradation by DPP-4 and of selective inhibitors of DPP-4 activity as therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 agonists (exenatide and liraglutide) and DPP-4 inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, vildagliptin, saxagliptin and linagliptin) currently represent effective treatment options for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several additional agents are in the pipeline, including longer acting DPP-4-resistant GLP-1 agonists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More exciting, however, is the increasing recognition that the incretin agents have numerous extra-glycaemic effects that could translate into potential cardiovascular and other benefits </plain></SENT>
