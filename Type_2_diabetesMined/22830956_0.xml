<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This large observational study was conducted in 10 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adverse event data (including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>) and glycaemic control were recorded before and 24 weeks following insulin initiation while patients continued routine clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 17,374 patients (53% male) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean pre-insulin values (± SD) were: age 62 ± 12 years; BMI 29.3 ± 5.4 kg/m(2) ; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 10 ± 7 years; HbA1c 8.9 ± 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the study, 27 patients experienced serious adverse drug reaction (SADRs), severe hypoglycaemic events or both; and there were 31 episodes of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24 weeks, HbA1c was 7.5 ± 1.2% (change of -1.3; p&lt;0.001) and mean weight change was -0.6 kg (CI -0.7, -0.5 kg, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Daily insulin dose increased from 13 ± 6 U (0.16 ± 0.09 U/kg) to 22 ± 16 U (0.27 ± 0.17U/kg) by 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis identified several independent demographic and treatment predictors of end of study HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of once-daily insulin detemir to patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on OHA therapy resulted in few adverse events, significant improvements in glycaemic control, small reductions in weight, and low rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on this study, concerns about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> should not preclude initiation of basal insulin analogues in patients with poor glycaemic control on OHAs </plain></SENT>
