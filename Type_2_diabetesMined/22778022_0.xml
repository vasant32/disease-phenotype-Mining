<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The co-occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses have shown robust associations of the solute carrier family 30 member 8 (SLC30A8) gene variants with T2DM in various populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the involvement of the SLC30A8 in the susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> in a Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The SLC30A8 rs13266634 gene polymorphism was genotyped in 837 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> schizophrenic and 1109 unrelated healthy controls by using a case control design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the rs13266634 genotype (χ(2)  = 1.95, df = 2, p = 0.38) and allele (χ(2)  = 0.47, df = 1, p = 0.50) distributions between the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association between rs13266634 and clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The SLC30A8 gene variation does not appear to contribute a genetic basis for the co-occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and T2DM </plain></SENT>
