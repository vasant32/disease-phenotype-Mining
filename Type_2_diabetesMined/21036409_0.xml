<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ARBs on the development of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about ARBs and new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified by electronic and manual searches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven RCTs with 79,773 patients (59,862 non-diabetic patients at baseline) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with control group, incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly reduced in ARBs group [OR 0.79, (0.74, 0.84)] and various categories of ARBs subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ARBs were associated with significant reduction in the risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with placebo [OR 0.83, (0.78, 0.89)], beta-blocker [OR 0.73, (0.62, 0.87)], <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> [OR 0.76, (0.68, 0.85)] and non-ARB [OR 0.57, (0.36, 0.91)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ARBs were associated with significant reduction in the risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> [OR 0.74, (0.68, 0.81)], <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> [OR 0.70, (0.50, 0.96)], <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [OR 0.85, (0.78, 0.92)] or cardiocerebrovascular diseases [OR 0.84, (0.72, 0.97)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with control group, incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly reduced in ARBs group, irrespective of achieved blood pressure level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ARBs were associated with a lower incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Western population [OR 0.81, (0.76, 0.85)] and Japanese population [OR 0.61, (0.48, 0.79)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is sufficient evidence that ARBs have beneficial effect in preventing new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ARBs should be considered in patients with high risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
