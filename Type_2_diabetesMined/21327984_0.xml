<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To detect the expression of syndecan-1 on neutrophils in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, we recruited 29 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complication</z:e> and 24 healthy subjects (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of syndecan-1 was determined by flow cytometry, and potential correlations between syndecan-1 and clinical characteristics were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On neutrophils, percentage of positive syndecan-1 cells was significantly higher in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (10.363 ± 1.689%) than that of the controls (3.775 ± 0.634%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association between body mass index (BMI) and percentage of positive syndecan-1 neutrophils was detected (r = 0.415, P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When BMI was categorized into subgroups of ≤25 kg/m(2) (n = 10) and &gt;25 kg/m(2) (n = 19), the average percentages of positive syndecan-1 neutrophils in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 5.733 ± 1.842% and 12.642 ± 2.251%, respectively (t = -2.137, P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multiple regression analysis showed that BMI (β = 0.783, P &lt; 0.000) was a significant predictor of positive syndecan-1 neutrophils in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
