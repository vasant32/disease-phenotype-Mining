<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is little evidence regarding the target blood pressure level in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed 608 Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> who underwent cerebral magnetic resonance imaging for a mean of 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were categorized according to their mean systolic blood pressure during the follow-up period (strict: &lt;130 mm Hg, moderate: ≥130 and &lt;140 mm Hg, poor: ≥ 140 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risks for the primary composite outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> were not different among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The renal risk of the doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> for the poor group was significantly higher than those in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, among the patients without silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (SCI), the renal risk was significantly lower in the strict group than in the moderate group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, in both the SCI and non-SCI groups, strict blood pressure control slowed the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In nonproteinuric diabetic patients without SCI, strict blood pressure control was associated with improved renal outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There may be different effects of intensive blood pressure control on the renoprotection of diabetic patients according to their complications </plain></SENT>
