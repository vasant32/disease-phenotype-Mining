<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Being able to make informed decisions is a prerequisite to enabling individuals to participate actively in their health care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In turn, an individual's understanding of relevant health information can influence his/her ability to make informed decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are two broad categories of health information, ie, background information (such as the pathophysiology of conditions) and foreground information (such as disease behavior, prognosis, and effects of treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Questions about foreground information are central to evidence-based practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of health literacy research has focused on background information, yet foreground information is more useful in decision-making, particularly for evidence-informed decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we explored individuals' knowledge of selected evidence-based concepts in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; beliefs about what they can do to manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and sources of this information; and whether these change after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Attendees with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 95) at a one-day <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> educational exposition completed a questionnaire before and after the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We asked participants about evidence-based concepts in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and compared their responses with the current evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also asked participants how they could best manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and then, how they knew this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most participants underestimated their risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the exception of a question about exercise and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants provided responses that are not supported by current research evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in the percentage of participants who answered questions correctly after the exposition, except for a question about the risks of low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in which more participants answered incorrectly afterwards (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Health professionals were the most frequently identified source of information, with little value placed on research evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Participants had a poor understanding of most of the evidence-based concepts in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This disadvantages them in being able to make informed decisions about their health care and actively manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
