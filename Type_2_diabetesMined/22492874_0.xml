<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether placental histology corresponds to differing causes of pregnancy loss in T1DM and T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that placentas from mothers with T2DM would be more likely to demonstrate vascular pathology than those from mothers with T1DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed medical histories, pregnancy outcomes, and placental histology of women with pregestational T1DM and T2DM with singleton pregnancies between 2001 and 2009 at a single tertiary care medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Placental weight, placental dysmaturity, villous maturation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1270169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">villitis</z:e> of unclear etiology, and histological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011416'>placental infarction</z:hpo> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-eight placentas were available for review, 53 from T1DM mothers (56%) and 45 from T2DM mothers (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age and glycemic control each trimester did not differ between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T2DM placentas had a higher prevalence of placental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (22 vs. 6%, P = 0.02) and a lower prevalence of placental dysmaturity (12 vs. 29%, P = 0.05) compared with T1DM; rates differed from those reported in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in placental weight, villous maturity, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1270169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">villitis</z:e> of unclear etiology between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were many similarities in placental histological findings between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Still, one in five T2DM placentas displayed histological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, consistent with a vascular, rather than glycemic, etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e>, whereas T1DM placentas showed signs of abnormal development </plain></SENT>
