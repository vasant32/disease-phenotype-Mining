<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the interactions between rs10423928 and macronutrients and fiber intakes on body mass index and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Among nondiabetic subjects in the Swedish population-based Malm√∂ Diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cohort (n = 24,840; 45-74 yr), 1541 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were identified during 12 yr of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary intakes were assessed using a diet history method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified through registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no indication that dietary intakes significantly modify the association between GIPR genotype and body mass index (P interaction &gt;0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed significant interactions between GIPR genotype and quintiles of carbohydrate (P = 0.0005) and fat intake (P = 0.0006) on incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TT-genotype carriers within the highest compared with the lowest carbohydrate quintile were at 23% (95% confidence interval = 5-39%) decreased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AA-genotype carriers in the highest compared with the lowest fat quintile were at 69% (95% confidence interval = 29-86%) decreased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective, observational study indicates that the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk by dietary intake of carbohydrate and fat may be dependent on GIPR genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In line with results in gipr knockout mice, AA-genotype carriers consuming high-fat low-carbohydrate diets had reduced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, whereas high-carbohydrate low-fat diets benefitted the two thirds of population homozygous for the T-allele </plain></SENT>
