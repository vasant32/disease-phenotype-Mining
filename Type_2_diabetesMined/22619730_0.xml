<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, the most commonly performed procedure worldwide, causes substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improvement in several comorbidities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, especially type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms are proposed to explain the improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism after RYGB surgery: the caloric restriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> per se, the improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta cell function, and finally the alterations in the various gastrointestinal hormones and adipokines that have been shown to play an important role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the timing, exact changes of these hormones, and the relative importance of these changes in the metabolic improvement postbariatric surgery remain to be further clarified </plain></SENT>
