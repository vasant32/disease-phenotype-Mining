<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 69 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and biopsy-confirmed diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> with mesangial expansion, and retrospectively examined the association of histological and clinical findings with renal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration was 52 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological scoring was made according to that of Tervaert et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into four groups according to glomerular classification (class 2a, mild mesangial expansion, n=11; class 2b, severe mesangial expansion without nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, n=15; class 3, nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, n=36; class 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004737'>global glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> observed in more than 50% of glomeruli, n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interstitial and vascular lesions were scored for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A renal event was defined as a condition requiring the initiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dialysis or doubling of the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the glomerular classes were not significant variables, while interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000092'>tubular atrophy</z:hpo> and interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were independent variables associated with renal end-point (HR: 3.36 (95% confidence interval: 1.21-9.32), 4.74 (1.26-17.91)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the renal survival rates between the glomerular classes 2a and 2b combined group and the glomerular class 3 group (P=0.17, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interstitial lesions but not glomerular lesions were a significant predictor for renal prognosis in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
