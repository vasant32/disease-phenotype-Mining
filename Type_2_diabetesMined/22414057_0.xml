<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35788">secosteroid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> is best known for its role in calcium regulation and bone metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, an emerging body of evidence has suggested that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> may have previously-unrecognized effects on a variety of physiologic processes, including those relating to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> insufficiency has been linked with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, the potential association between <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and T2DM will be evaluated from both a pathophysiologic and clinical perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We consider the biologic evidence in support of a mechanistic contribution of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> insufficiency to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo>, the two main pathophysiologic defects underlying T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also evaluate the clinical data linking <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> with these metabolic defects and dysglycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, interventional studies addressing the effect of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At present, this evolving literature is marked by many conflicting results and methodologic limitations, such that definitive conclusion on the role of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> in T2DM remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in light of the widespread prevalence of both <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> insufficiency and T2DM, this potential relationship could hold enormous public health implications and hence demands further study to address its unresolved questions </plain></SENT>
