<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate possible associations of the recommended food groups of the DASH diet eating plan with BP values in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present cross-sectional study, 225 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age 61·1 (sd 10·4) years; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 13·1 (sd 9·1) years; males 48·4 %; BMI 28·5 (sd 4·3) kg/m2; HbA1c 7·1 (sd 1·3) %; systolic BP 136·7 (sd 20·0) mmHg; diastolic BP 78·4 (sd 11·8) mmHg) without dietary counselling during the previous 6 months had their dietary intake assessed by 3 d weighed-diet records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to BP tertiles: LOW BP (first tertile) and HIGH BP (second plus third tertiles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models demonstrated that the daily intake of 80 g of fruits per 4184 kJ (1000 kcal) (OR 0·781; 95 % CI 0·617, 0·987; P = 0·039) or 50 g of vegetables per 4184 kJ (1000 kcal) (OR 0·781; 95 % CI 0·618, 0·988; P = 0·040) reduced the chance of the presence of HIGH mean BP (MBP ≥ 92 mmHg) by 22 % each, adjusted for possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, fruit and vegetables were the food groups of the DASH diet associated with reduced BP values in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and their consumption might play a protective role against increased BP values </plain></SENT>
