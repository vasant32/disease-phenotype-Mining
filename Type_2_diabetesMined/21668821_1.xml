<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:   Advanced glycation end products (AGE) have been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic vascular complications</z:e> through activation of pro-inflammatory genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AGE-modified proteins are also targeted by the immune system resulting in the generation of AGE-specific autoantibodies, but the association of these immune responses with diabetic vasculopathy remains to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B100 modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">methylglyoxal</z:chebi> (MGO-apoB100) are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   We measured antibodies against MGO-apoB100 in plasma from 497 type 2 diabetic patients without clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> was assessed as coronary artery calcium (CAC) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG levels recognizing MGO-apoB100 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Anti-MGO-apoB100 IgM antibody levels were higher in subjects with a low to moderate CAC score (≤400 Agatston units) than in subjects with a high score (&gt;400 Agatston units; 136.8±4.4 vs. 101.6± 7.4 arbitrary units (AU), P&lt;0.0001) and in subjects demonstrating no progression of CAC during 30 months of follow-up (136.4±5.7 vs. 113.9 ± 6.2 AU in subjects with progression, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a family history of premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> had lower levels of anti-MGO-apoB100 IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female subjects had higher levels of anti-MGO-apoB100 antibodies and lower CAC than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, high levels of IgM against MGO-apoB100 are associated with less severe and a lower risk of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although conclusions regarding causal relationships based on epidemiological observations need to be made with caution, our findings suggest the possibility that anti-MGO-apoB100 IgM may be protective in diabetic vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
