<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is strong evidence that increased adipose 11β-HSD1 activity may be an important aetiological factor in the current <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type 2 epidemics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has emerged as a promising anti-diabetic strategy, a concept that is largely supported by numerous studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> as well as limited clinical data with prototype inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Momordica charantia (also known as bitter melon, bitter gourd or karela) is traditionally used for treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and East Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that M. charantia extract capsules contain at least one ingredient with selective 11��-HSD1 inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The finding constitutes an interesting additional explanation for the well-documented anti-diabetic and hypoglycaemic effects of M. charantia </plain></SENT>
