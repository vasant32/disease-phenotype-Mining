<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship of dehydroepiandrosterone with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> factor activated protein C, generated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on vascular endothelial cells, remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at studying the relationship between dehydroepiandrosterone and activated protein C generation in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two male patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data obtained from 40 healthy male subjects were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, the activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were measured by enzyme immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid intima-media thickness was measured by ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (5.15 ± 2.81 vs. 3.76 ± 2.16 ng/ml; P &lt; 0.005) and the activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex (1.90 ± 1.07 vs. 1.02 ± 0.51 ng/ml; P &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation of the plasma level of dehydroepiandrosterone with that of the activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex (r = 0.48, P &lt; 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (r = -0.30, P &lt; 0.05) and with the mean intima-media thickness (r = -0.28, P &lt; 0.05) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the plasma level of dehydroepiandrosterone is significantly correlated with the plasma levels of the activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex (F = 18.06) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (F = 4.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that lower circulating levels of dehydroepiandrosterone are associated with decreased activated protein C generation and higher intima-media thickness in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
