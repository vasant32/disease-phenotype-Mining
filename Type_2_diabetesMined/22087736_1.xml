<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Insulin-treated patients perform complex treatment activities during daily routine, such as blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements and insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify suitable dexterity and cognitive function tests for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, and to compare the patient self-assessment of their dexterity skills with the test results (Jebsen-Taylor hand function test, (JHFT), motoric performance test (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e>), number connection test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We enrolled 90 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (36 females, 54 males): 15 type 1 with clinically suspected dexterity impairment (A: age: 60 ± 9 years), 30 type 2 with clinically suspected dexterity impairment (B: 61 ± 10 years), 30 type 1 or type 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> (C: 64 ± 6 years), and 15 type 1 or type 2 patients without obvious impairment (control group: D: 64 ± 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and slight impairments in the number connection test in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient self-assessment revealed that 33.4% in group A, 33.3% in group B, 36.7% in group C and 13.7% in group D, considered themselves to have dexterity impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However in the JHFT test, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from A (100%) and B (100%), 33% from C, and 0% from D presented with dexterity impairment by only passing less than four subtests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of dexterity was much more frequent than believed by the patients themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be worthwhile to consider these findings when classifying patients regarding their capabilities to perform certain treatments or when assessing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> technology with human subjects </plain></SENT>
