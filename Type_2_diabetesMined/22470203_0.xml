<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of our study was to study the spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> in diabetics, to know the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> specific to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), and to establish the mucocutaneous markers of DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted at a diabetic clinic and our department between September 2008 and June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and twenty-four diabetic patients were included in the study group and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Healthy age- and sex-matched individuals were taken as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 1 : 1.21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 DM was seen in 89.7% and type 1 DM in 10.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dermatoses</z:e> were seen in 88.3% of the diabetics compared to 36% in non-diabetic controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001581'>Cutaneous infections</z:hpo> were the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000958'>xerosis</z:hpo> in diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Type 2 DM was found to have an increased risk of complications than type 1 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were seen in 43.7% of the diabetic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000951'>dermopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000414'>loss of hair</z:mp> over the legs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, and so on, were found to be the cutaneous markers of DM in our group of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dermatoses</z:e> were more common in diabetics than non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001581'>Cutaneous infections</z:hpo> formed the largest group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> in DM </plain></SENT>
