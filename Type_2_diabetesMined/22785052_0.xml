<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on the patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> after disease diagnosis and the interrelationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data were collected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study cohort included 3717 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 37,170 age- and sex-matched comparison patients from the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were tracked for 7years following their index visit in 2000-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: After adjusting for potential confounders, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk was approximately 63% higher (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; 95% CI, 1.33-1.99) among newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients than among comparison subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also increased the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>About 43.6% of diabetic patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> during the follow-up period, higher than the rate 29.6% in the comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with a 63% higher future risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during the 7-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> overlap rate in the diabetic study group suggests vascular events play an important role in the pathogenesis of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
