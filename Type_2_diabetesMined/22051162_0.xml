<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To compare the effects of miglitol [an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (AGI) absorbed in the intestine] and voglibose (an AGI not absorbed) on plasma glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) levels, 26 and 24 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to receive miglitol or voglibose, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 12-week administration of both drugs, during 2-h meal tolerance test, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin and total GIP were significantly decreased and active GLP-1 was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Miglitol group showed a significantly lower total GIP level than voglibose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Miglitol, but not voglibose, significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> (BW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, the relative change in BW was positively correlated with that of insulin significantly and of GIP with a weak tendency, but not of GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both drugs can enhance postprandial GLP-1 responses and reduce GIP responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significant BW reduction by miglitol might be attributable to its strong GIP-reducing efficacy </plain></SENT>
