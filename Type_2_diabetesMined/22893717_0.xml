<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Osteocyte/osteoblast dysfunction develops in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM).Objective:Our objective was to examine whether increases in serum FGF-23 and PTH after oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> stimulation are impaired in type 2 DM.Design and Methods:The subjects were 10 DM and 10 non-DM patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> stage 3-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum FGF-23, intact PTH (iPTH), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> were measured serially after oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> administration at a daily dose of 2.0 g.Results:<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> administration caused significant increases of FGF-23 by 2 h and iPTH by 4 h in non-DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These increases were attenuated in DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 d of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> stimulation, serum FGF-23 and iPTH remained elevated in non-DM patients but not in DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, initial changes of serum FGF-23 (0-2 h) and iPTH (0-4 h) were positively correlated (r = 0.528) and showed significant negative correlations with later changes in serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> (2-4 h) (r = -0.457 and r = -0.673, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> (2-4 h) significantly increased in DM patients, consistent with the lack of change in serum FGF-23 and iPTH, whereas serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> did not change significantly in non-DM patients.Conclusion:These results show that increases of serum FGF-23 and PTH in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> stimulation are impaired in type 2 DM and that serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> is significantly increased thereafter </plain></SENT>
