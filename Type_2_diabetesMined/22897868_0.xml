<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time has come to re-evaluate the clinical management of T2D patients using metabolic parameters alone, and to realize that patients should be stratified based on their immune and/or autoimmune status prior to initiation of therapy to realize fully the potential of immunomodulatory strategies for T2D </plain></SENT>
