<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene have been reported to be associated with T2DM and its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate this association in the Moroccan population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was performed among 282 Moroccan diabetic patients and 232 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction, followed by enzymatic digestion with HinfI and MboII enzymes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant association between C677T polymorphism and T2DM in both additive and dominant models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the 677T allele frequency differed significantly between the diabetic and control groups (26.06% vs. 33.20%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant association was found between A1298C polymorphism and T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of combined genotypes 677CC/1298AA and 677CT/1298AC differed significantly between the diabetic and control groups (32.62% vs. 20.61% and 9.57% vs. 17.55%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show an evident association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and T2DM in Moroccan patients but no significant association with the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism </plain></SENT>
