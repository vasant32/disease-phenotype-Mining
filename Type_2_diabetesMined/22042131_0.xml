<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate TNF-α system activity in association with renal histology in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 22 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (16 men), 13 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and 9 with normoalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma-soluble TNF-α receptor 1 and 2 (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) concentrations were used as surrogates of TNF-α system activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was analysed using I(125)-Iodothalamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Albumin excretion rate (AER) and a renal biopsy were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AER did not associate significantly with mesangial expansion or interstitial fraction in these subjects (r &lt; 0.12, P &gt; 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AER was also not associated with either sTNFR1 or sTNFR2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, after controlling for GFR, the correlation between AER and sTNFR1 became significant (r = 0.47, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>sTNFR1 correlated with age (r = 0.65, P &lt; 0.001), mesangial expansion (r = 0.59, P = 0.004) and interstitial fraction (r = 0.58, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age, body mass index and blood pressure, the association of TNFR1 with mesangial expansion persisted significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Circulating sTNFR2 concentrations were not significantly associated with histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, structural kidney damage in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with TNF-α system activity and specifically with plasma sTNFR1 concentrations </plain></SENT>
