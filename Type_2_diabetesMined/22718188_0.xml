<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether biomarkers of tubular injury could predict renal outcome and mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we measured urinary levels of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> non-metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> B (Gpnmb), both normalized to the urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, in 978 individuals from the Edinburgh Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 238 patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min/1.73��m(2) while 147 and 15 patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the urine KIM-1 and Gpnmb to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratios correlated with the urinary albumin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the stringency of glycemic control but not with blood pressure or baseline eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher ratios of each marker were associated with a faster decline in kidney function during 4 years of follow-up; however, this was not independent of the urinary albumin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher KIM-1, but not Gpnmb ratios were associated with an increased risk of mortality, but this association was no longer significant after adjustment for other risk factors, in particular <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, tubular injury in persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may contribute to the decline in kidney function; however, measuring the urinary concentration of these two tubular biomarkers does not confer additional prognostic information beyond established risk factors.Kidney International advance online publication, 20 June 2012; doi:10.1038/ki.2012.218 </plain></SENT>
