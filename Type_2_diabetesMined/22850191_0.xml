<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the understanding of how dietary macronutrient composition relates to long-term risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine intakes of macronutrients, fibre and protein sources in relation to incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 27 140 individuals, aged 45-74 years, from the population-based Malmö Diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cohort, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary data were collected with a modified diet history method, including registration of cooked meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During 12 years of follow-up, 1709 incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High protein intake was associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio (HR) 1·27 for highest compared with lowest quintile; 95 % CI 1·08, 1·49; P for trend = 0·01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When protein consumption increased by 5 % of energy at the expense of carbohydrates (HR 1·20; 95 % CI 1·09, 1·33) or fat (HR 1·21; 95 % CI 1·09, 1·33), increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intakes in the highest quintiles of processed meat (HR 1·16; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·36; P for trend = 0·01) and eggs (HR 1·21; 95 % CI 1·04, 1·41; P for trend = 0·02) were associated with increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intake of fibre-rich bread and cereals was inversely associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 0·84; 95 % CI 0·73, 0·98; P for trend = 0·004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, results from the present large population-based prospective study indicate that high protein intake is associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Replacing protein with carbohydrates may be favourable, especially if fibre-rich breads and cereals are chosen as carbohydrate sources </plain></SENT>
