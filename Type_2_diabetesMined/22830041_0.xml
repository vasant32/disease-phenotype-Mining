<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the demographic profile and clinical characteristics of individuals with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> steroid-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (NOSID) to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) patients with and without steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The demographic profile and clinical characteristics of 60 individuals who developed NOSID were examined and matched to 60 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients receiving steroid therapy (T2DM+S) and 360 diabetic patients not on steroids (T2DM) for age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c, gender, and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed NOSID had less family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P ≤ 0.05) and were less overweight (P ≤ 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NOSID was more commonly treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a matching duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and glycaemic control, significantly less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was found in the group of patients with NOSID (P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It appears that steroid treatment primarily precipitated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a group of individuals otherwise less affected by risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at that point in time, rather than just opportunistically unmasking preexisting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> suggests that patients with NOSID had not been exposed to long periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of the underlying conditions necessitating steroid treatment and concomitant medications such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development remain to be defined </plain></SENT>
