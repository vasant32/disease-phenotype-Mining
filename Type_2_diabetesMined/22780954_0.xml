<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The genetic background of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is complex involving contribution by both nuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an excess of maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and, furthermore, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a common symptom in patients with mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in mtDNA have been reported to act as risk factors in several complex diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We examined the nucleotide variation in complete mtDNA sequences of 64 Finnish patients with matrilineal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis and sequencing to detect sequence variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analysed the pathogenic potential of nonsynonymous variants detected in the sequences and examined the role of the m.16189 T&gt;C variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Controls consisted of non-diabetic subjects ascertained in the same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of mtDNA haplogroup V was 3-fold higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients harboured many nonsynonymous mtDNA substitutions that were predicted to be possibly or probably damaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a novel m.13762 T&gt;G in MTND5 leading to p.Ser476Ala and several rare mtDNA variants were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Haplogroup H1b harbouring m.16189 T &gt; C and m.3010 G &gt; A was found to be more frequent in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mildly deleterious nonsynonymous mtDNA variants and rare population-specific haplotypes constitute genetic risk factors for maternally inherited <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
