<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The present study was undertaken to determine whether there were changes evident in axonal membrane function prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a cohort of 110 consecutive referrals, nerve excitability was investigated in 40 diabetic patients without clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (20 type 1: 20 type 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups were matched for gender, disease duration and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies were also undertaken in two control groups, younger controls and older controls, matched for age and gender with the diabetic cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> demonstrated significant nerve excitability abnormalities when compared to younger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, type 1 subjects showed a significant reduction multiple time points in both depolarising and hyperpolarising threshold electrotonus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the relative refractory period was prolonged (type 1 3.19 ms: younger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls 3.0 ms; p &lt; 0.05) and superexcitability was reduced (type 1 -23.12%: younger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls -26.37%; p &lt; 0.05), consistent with axonal membrane depolarisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlations were identified in type 1 patients between disease duration and nerve excitability parameters, including the relative refractory period (r = -0.533, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only minor non-specific changes were noted in the type 2 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study provides clear evidence of altered axonal function in type 1 diabetic patients in the absence of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that altered axonal membrane potential may precede <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and as such may indicate a window of opportunity to intervene and potentially reverse axonal membrane dysfunction before the development of irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
