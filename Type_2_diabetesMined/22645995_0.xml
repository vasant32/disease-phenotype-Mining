<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied prophylactic potential of local use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27974">estriol</z:chebi> in respect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary infections</z:hpo> (UI) in postmenopausal women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asymptomatic bacteriuria</z:e> (AB) suffering from type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A two-stage trial has been conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stage one (a prospective study) was made to detect AB in DM women with AB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 414 female examinees AB was detected in 87 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At stage two these women were randomized into two groups: group 1 received 0.5 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27974">estriol</z:chebi> as vaginal cream, group 2 (control) received no prophylactic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 9 months of the trial AB was detected in 19.4% women of group 1 and 68.4% of the control group (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant UI was detected in 8.3 and 18.4% examinees (p&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between AB development and a HbA1c level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27974">Estriol</z:chebi> treatment resulted in a rise of vaginal health index (VHI), appearance of lactobacteria in the vaginal smear, lowering of atrophic <z:mp ids='MP_0003541'>vaginitis</z:mp> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were registered in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, local <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27974">estriol</z:chebi> administration effectively prevents and treats UI in postmenopausal females </plain></SENT>
