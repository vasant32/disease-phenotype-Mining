<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: With use of a factorial 2 Ã— 2 randomized parallel-group design, 37 men and 8 women, aged 35-70 years, with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in satisfactory blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control on diet or diet plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment were assigned to one of the following groups for an 8-week period: 1) high-carbohydrate/high-fiber/low-glycemic index diet (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>/fiber group), 2) high-MUFA diet (MUFA group), 3) high-carbohydrate/high-fiber/low-glycemic index diet plus physical activity program (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>/fiber+Ex group), and 4) high-MUFA diet plus physical activity program (MUFA+Ex group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after intervention, hepatic fat content was measured by (1)H NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dietary compliance was optimal and body weight remained stable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liver fat content decreased more in MUFA (-29%) and MUFA+Ex (-25%) groups than in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>/fiber (-4%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>/fiber+Ex groups (-6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, including baseline values as covariate, showed a significant effect on liver fat content for diet (P = 0.006), with no effects for exercise training (P = 0.789) or diet-exercise interaction (P = 0.712) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An isocaloric diet enriched in MUFA compared with a diet higher in carbohydrate and fiber was associated with a clinically relevant reduction of hepatic fat content in type 2 diabetic patients independent of an aerobic training program and should be considered for the nutritional management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
