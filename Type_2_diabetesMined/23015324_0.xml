<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several recent genetic studies have pointed out that a common variant in the gene that encodes the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptor 2 (MTNR1B) is associated with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp>, and an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we try to review the role of this receptor and its signaling pathways in respect to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and development of the disease </plain></SENT>
