<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DeSIGN, PATIENTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: In this 52-week treatment study, 150 patients (mean age, 54·9 ± 12·5 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and HbA1c of 7·0-10% were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg once and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 500 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the predictive parameters for therapeutic efficacy, a multivariate regression analysis was performed with baseline fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and glucagon levels, homoeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and β-cell function (HOMA-B), insulinogenic index (IGI, defined as 30-0 min insulin/30-0 min <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), and area under the curve for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> obtained after 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 52 weeks, mean HbA1c levels and fasting and postload 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were significantly decreased from 8·7 ± 1·4% to 7·2 ± 1·3%, 9·2 ± 3·0 to 7·2 ± 1·8 mm, and 17·5 ± 5·1 to 10·9 ± 3·6 mm, respectively (P &lt; 0·01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HOMA-B and IGI increased significantly from 50·3 ± 33·5 to 75·1 ± 32·8 and from 11·3 ± 1·3 to 35·0 ± 6·3 at 52 weeks, respectively (P &lt; 0·01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the reduction in HbA1c was significantly associated with high baseline HbA1c, low IGI, and short duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, high-sensitivity CRP, glucagon, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, HOMA-B, and HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that drug-naïve type 2 diabetic patients with low β-cell function would benefit the most from early initial combination therapy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
