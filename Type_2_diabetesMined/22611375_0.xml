<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the GLP-1 receptor is a member of the structurally complex class B1 family of GPCRs, in recent years, a diverse array of orthosteric and allosteric nonpeptide ligands has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These compounds include <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, and positive allosteric modulators with intrinsic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, a comprehensive review of currently disclosed small molecule GLP-1 receptor ligands is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, examples of "ligand bias" and "probe dependency" for the GLP-1 receptor are discussed; these emerging concepts may influence further optimization of known molecules or persuade designs of expanded screening strategies to identify novel chemical starting points for GLP-1 receptor drug discovery </plain></SENT>
