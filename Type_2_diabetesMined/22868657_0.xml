<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, bone, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study subjects (144 postmenopausal women aged less than 80 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) were randomly assigned into three groups: no medication, alfacalcidol 1 μg/day, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50740">raloxifene hydrochloride</z:chebi> 60 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">Raloxifene</z:chebi> significantly decreased the levels of bone metabolism markers NTX and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29022">BAP</z:chebi> at 6 months in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> at 6 months, was significantly lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> group than in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, percent changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> were not significantly different among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was unaffected, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, a bone quality marker, was significantly decreased at 6 months in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percent improvement in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> did not correlate with percent improvement in any bone metabolism or bone quality markers </plain></SENT>
