<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of more sophisticated techniques for studying gene variants and for analysing genetic data has led to the discovery of some 40 genes associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these genes are related to changes in β-cell function, with a few associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, using quantitative traits based on continuous measures rather than dichotomous ones, it has become evident that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes associated with changes in fasting or post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> are also associated with a diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identification of these gene variants has provided novel insights into the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and pathophysiology of the β-cell, including the identification of molecules involved in β-cell function that were not previously recognized as playing a role in this critical cell </plain></SENT>
