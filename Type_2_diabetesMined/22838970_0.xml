<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed whether or not gender differences exist in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHD medication among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was based on data from the baseline examination of the DIANA study, a prospective cohort study of 1,146 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> conducted in South-West Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHD medication was obtained from the physician questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bivariate and multivariate analyses using logistic regression were employed in order to assess associations between gender and prescribed drug classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 624 men and 522 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a mean age of 67.2 and 69.7 years, respectively, were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to women, men had more angiopathic risk factors, including smoking, alcohol consumption and worse glycemic control, and had more often a diagnosed CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bivariate analyses showed higher prescription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> and oral combination drugs as well as of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> and aspirin in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After full adjustment, differences between men and women remained significant only for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> (OR = 1.44; 95%-confidence interval (CI): 1.11 - 1.88) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> (OR = 1.42, 95%-CI: 1.05 - 1.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to current discussions on gender differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are significantly more likely to receive oral combination drugs, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest, that diabetic men might be more thoroughly treated compared to women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to focus on reasons for these differences mainly in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> to improve quality of care </plain></SENT>
