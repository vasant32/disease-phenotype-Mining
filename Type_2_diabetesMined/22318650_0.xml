<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential studies were identified by searching the PubMed database in September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective cohort studies that reported relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for dietary calcium intake were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were combined using either a fixed- or random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six prospective cohort studies comprising 264268 participants and 11225 reported cases were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> combined random-effects meta-analysis yielded a significant pooled RR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.75-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a sensitivity analysis limited to four studies with control for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> yielded an attenuated, nonsignificant pooled RR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.85-1.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, dietary calcium intake was not independently associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inverse association in prior observational studies may be partially confounded by <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
