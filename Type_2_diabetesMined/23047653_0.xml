<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evidence for familial aggregation of both T2D and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, more than 150 genetic loci are associated with the development of monogenic, syndromic, or multifactorial forms of T2D or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of overall trait variance explained by these associated loci is modest (~5-10% for T2D, ~2% for body mass index (BMI)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of the familial aggregation not attributable to known genetic variation, as well as many of the effects of environmental exposures, may reflect epigenetic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the evidence concerning the genetic contribution to individual risk of T2D and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and explore the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also explain how genetics, epigenetics, and environment are likely to interact to define the individual risk of disease.Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics (2012); advance online publication 10 October 2012. doi:10.1038/clpt.2012.149 </plain></SENT>
