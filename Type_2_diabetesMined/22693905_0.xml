<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26605">saponins</z:chebi> from Entada phaseoloides (TSEP) on islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and skeletal muscle PI3K pathway-related protein expression of type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Type 2 diabetic rats were induced by high-fat diet and low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> and then randomly divided into 5 groups, i.e. the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, the model group, the positive control drug (200 mg x kg(-1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>), the low-dose TSEP (25 mg x kg(-1)) group and the high-dose TSEP (50 mg x kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three weeks later, the islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of rat pancreas were observed by HE staining, and protein expressions of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1 B) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 4 (GLUT4) in rat skeletal muscle were detected by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Compared with the modal group, TSEP administration groups showed relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structures, clear pancreatic cells and intact capsula structures in pancreatic tissue pathological sections, with the number of pancreatic islets close to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, above TSEP administration groups showed increased IRS-1, PI3K and GLUT4 protein expressions in their skeletal muscle tissues and <z:mp ids='MP_0002922'>decreased PTP</z:mp>-1B protein expression compared with the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TSEP has an effect on protecting pancreatic tissues of type 2 diabetic rats and intervening in abnormal expression of proteins in skeletal muscle tissues </plain></SENT>
