<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Echocardiography was performed in 61 type 1 and 123 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was taken as LV mass/height(2.7) &gt; 49.2 g/m(2.7) in men and &gt; 46.7 g/m(2.7) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated as the ratio of LV posterior wall thickness to end-diastolic radius and considered increased if â‰¥ 0.43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LV geometry was defined from LV mass index and RWT in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common <z:mp ids='MP_0003921'>abnormal LV</z:mp> geometries were concentric remodelling in type 1 (30%) and concentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in type 2 (36.7%) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, increased RWT was present in 58% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, higher RWT was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, longer isovolumic relaxation time, lower stress-corrected midwall shortening and circumferential end-systolic stress, both in type 1 (multiple R(2) = 0.73) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (multiple R(2) = 0.66), both p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of gender, LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased RWT is common among diabetic sub-Saharan Africans and is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and LV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
