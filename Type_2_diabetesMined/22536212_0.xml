<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> is used for the early detection of diabetic renal damage, but such levels do not reflect the state of incipient DN precisely in type 2 diabetic patients because <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> develops in other diseases, necessitating more accurate biomarkers that detect incipient DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) were used to identify urinary proteins that were differentially excreted in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> where 710 and 196 proteins were identified and quantified, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some candidates were confirmed by 2-DE analysis, or validated by Western blot and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, some differentially expressed proteins were verified by MRM in urine from normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, wherein alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1, and prostate stem cell antigen had excellent AUC values (0.849, 0.873, and 0.825, resp.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we performed a multiplex assay using these biomarker candidates, resulting in a merged AUC value of 0.921 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the differentially expressed proteins in this iTRAQ study require further validation in larger and categorized sample groups, they constitute baseline data on preliminary biomarker candidates that can be used to discover novel biomarkers for incipient DN </plain></SENT>
