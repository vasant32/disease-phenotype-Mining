<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched MEDLINEÂ®, Embase, the Cochrane Library and the International Pharmaceuticals from their inception through 3 February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were included of adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that were 12 weeks or more in duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses were conducted when included studies were homogenous enough to justify combining their results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 articles met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg monotherapy and saxagliptin 5 mg resulted in greater HbA1c reduction compared to placebo [weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.82%, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.70 and WMD -0.70, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.56, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> was similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> for HbA1c reduction (WMD 0.08%, 95% CI 0-0.16, 3 trials) and to saxagliptin in one head-to-head trial </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their role in the long-term treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains unclear given the lack of long-term data on efficacy, harms and health outcomes </plain></SENT>
