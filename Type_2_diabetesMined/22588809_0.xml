<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp>, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from April 2008 to March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 229 subjects were selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters recorded included BMI, waist hip ratio (WHR), total body water, fat, protein, and lean body masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were analyzed for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), and resistin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that BMI, WHR, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, and resistin levels were significantly higher in diabetics compared to non-diabetic healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fat mass was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with controls, while the difference for muscle mass and lean body mass was non-significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was observed between plasma levels of resistin and fat mass in patients with DM (r=0.2824, p=0.0030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Type 2 DM patients have significantly higher resistin levels that are positively correlated with body fat mass supporting the evidence that resistin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
