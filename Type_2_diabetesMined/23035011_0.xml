<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this meta-analysis was to collate and analyse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary observational studies investigating the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we aimed to complete sub group analyses by both type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and gender of study participants to further clarify the origin of any such association between the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies were obtained from a database search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Current Contents Connect and Google Scholar with additional cross checking of reference lists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collated data was assessed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and a pooled odds ratio calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>41 studies were included in the meta-analysis with 38 studies investigating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in women and 5 studies investigating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, we found a significantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both women (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.35) and men (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.10-1.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After sub group analysis by type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> the association was unchanged with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.40) and nullified with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.79-1.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were insufficient studies to calculate a pooled odds ratio of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> associated with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in both women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association is confirmed in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and supports the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
