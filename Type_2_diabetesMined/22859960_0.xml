<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is important to identify patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>Maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) as a molecular diagnosis determines both treatment and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing is currently expensive and many patients are therefore not assessed and are misclassified as having either type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers could facilitate the prioritisation of patients for genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that patients with different underlying genetic aetiologies for their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could have distinct metabolic profiles which may uncover novel biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to perform metabolic profiling in urine from patients with MODY due to mutations in the genes encoding glucokinase (GCK) or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) and normoglycaemic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urinary metabolic profiling by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and ultra performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to Q-TOF mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was performed in a Discovery set of subjects with HNF1A-MODY (n = 14), GCK-MODY (n = 17), T2D (n = 14) and normoglycaemic controls (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were used to build a valid partial least squares discriminate analysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) model where HNF1A-MODY subjects could be separated from the other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No single metabolite contributed significantly to the separation of the patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, betaine, valine, glycine and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were elevated in the urine of HNF1A-MODY subjects compared to the other subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Direct measurements of urinary amino acids and betaine in an extended dataset did not support differences between patients groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in HNF1A-MODY is consistent with the previously reported low renal threshold for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in this genetic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we report the first metabolic profiling study in monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and show that, despite the distinct biochemical pathways affected, there are unlikely to be robust urinary biomarkers which distinguish monogenic subtypes from T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results have implications for studies investigating metabolic profiles in complex traits including T2D </plain></SENT>
