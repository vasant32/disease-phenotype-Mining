<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed; 1) to determine the validity of the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) for the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of Korean patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 2) to identify associated factors of the HRQOL of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up surveys were conducted for consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HRQOL was assessed using the EQ-5D and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The validity of EQ-5D was assessed with the perspectives of known group, convergent and discriminant validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a linear mixed model using a backward elimination was used for identify associated factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 1,072 patients included in the first survey, 858 (80.0%) completed the questionnaires in the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the known group validity, the problem rates in each EQ-5D dimension were highest among women, elderly people, and less-educated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Spearman's œÅ between the EQ-5D and the SF-36 scales were larger in the comparable dimensions than those in the less comparable dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the final model, we found that sex, age, education, body mass index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the EQ-5D is a valid tool for Korean patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that various factors could affect their HRQOL </plain></SENT>
