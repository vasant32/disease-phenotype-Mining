<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the effectiveness of two methods of follow-up: short message service and telephone follow-up on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> adherence for three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Using telemedicine approaches may preserve appropriate blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and may improve adherence to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control recommendations in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A quasi-experimental, two-group, pretest and post-test design was used in this study to evaluate the effectiveness of nurse's follow-up via cellular phones and telephones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample consisted of 77 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that randomly were assigned to two groups: telephone follow-up (n = 39) and short message service (n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telephone interventions were applied by a researcher for three months; twice a week for the first month and every week for the second and third month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For three successive months, the short message service group that received messages about adherence to therapeutic regimen was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data gathering instrument included data sheets - to record glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> - and the questionnaire related to adherence therapeutic regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data gathering was carried out at the beginning of the study and after three and six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistic methods with SPSS version 11.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results showed that both interventions had significant mean changes in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the telephone group (p &lt; 0.001), a mean change of -0.93 and for the short message service group (p &lt; 0.001), a mean change of -1.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in diet adherence (p = 0.000), physical exercise (p = 0.000) and medication taking (p = 0.000) adherence in either groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intervention using short message services of cellular phones and nurse-led-telephone follow-up improved HbA1c levels and adherence to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapeutic regimen for three months in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Both of follow-up intervention uses in this study can decrease HbA1c levels and escalate adherence to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control recommendations in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for three months </plain></SENT>
