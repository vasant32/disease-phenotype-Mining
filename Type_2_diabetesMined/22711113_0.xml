<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>REVIEW SCOPE: Included studies compared self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with no self-monitoring in patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, included ≥ 80 patients, and had ≥ 6 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was HbA1c level; secondary outcomes were blood pressure and serum cholesterol level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>REVIEW METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE/Excerpta Medica (Apr 2009 to Jun 2010), the reference list of a systematic review that included studies from January 2000 to April 2009, reference lists of other reviews, conference proceedings, and a current controlled trials register were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Authors of included studies were contacted for individual patient data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>6 RCTs (n = 2552, mean age 60 y, 54% men) met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 RCTs described randomization, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss to follow-up ranged from 2% to 31% (mean 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention-to-treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Meta-analysis of individual patient data showed that self-monitoring blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reduced HbA1c levels at 3, 6, and 12 months compared with no self-monitoring (Table) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean pooled reduction in HbA1c was 9.6 mmol/mol (0.88%) in the intervention group and 7.5 mmol/mol (0.69%) in the usual care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Groups did not differ for blood pressure or total cholesterol (Table) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results were similar across patients with different levels of HbA1c at baseline (P = 0.3), including those with HbA1c &gt; 64 mmol/mol (&gt; 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reduces HbA1c by 0.25% at 6 months compared with no self-monitoring </plain></SENT>
