<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Short-term intensive insulin treatment in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can improve Î²-cell function and insulin sensitivity, which results in long-term remission without need for further antidiabetes medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient attitudes toward their disease were assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care Profile (DCP) tool to evaluate the potential impact on maintaining long-term remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited and treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for 2-3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were also invited to participate in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management intervention during hospitalization and complete a DCP questionnaire on attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after suspension of CSII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Near normoglycemia was achieved by 118 patients after short-term CSII, with 65 remaining in drug-free remission for &gt;1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had significantly better glycemic control and greater restoration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response after CSII as well as higher educational attainment compared with patients experiencing relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also achieved higher scores in positive attitude, (belief in) importance of care, care ability, self-care adherence, and less negative attitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences between the two groups became greater over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model analysis indicated that greater self-care adherence (hazard ratio 0.184, P &lt; 0.001) and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> before treatment (0.854, P = 0.053) were independent predictors for long-term remission, whereas elevated 2-h postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after CSII (1.156, P = 0.015) was a risk factor for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> affect long-term drug-free remission in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after short-term CSII </plain></SENT>
