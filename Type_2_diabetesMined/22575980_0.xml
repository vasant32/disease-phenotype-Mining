<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ratios and individual <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> indexes of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples were collected from 128 type 2 diabetic patients (aged 19-90 years; male 72, female 56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sera were analyzed for HbA(1c), total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the HbA(1c) level, the patients were divided into three groups, group A (HbA(1c) &lt;7%, n=31), group B (7%≤HbA(1c)≤10%, n=48), and group C (HbA(1c) &gt;10%, n=49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation of HbA(1c) with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ratios &amp; individual <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> indexes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the increased level of HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> had a significantly increasing trend (P&lt;0.05); whereas TC went up with the increased HbA(1c), without any significant differences between three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between HbA(1c) and TG or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the increased level of HbA(1c), TC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratios were gradually increased, with significant differences among groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ratios, especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio was more susceptible to impaired <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in T2DM patients than individual <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio is helpful in assessing and reducing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> caused by impaired <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
