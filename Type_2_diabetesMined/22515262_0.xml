<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The achievement of a good glycemic control and, in particular, the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> represent the most significant treatment target for the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple daily insulin injections are often still required to gain the treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the noncompliance with injected insulin therapy causes a slowdown in the process of glycemic compensation, novel non-injectable insulin formulations have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral spray insulin (Oralgen) is a tasteless liquid formulation that provides insulin absorption via buccal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: To elucidate the current status of Oralgen in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, studies of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic and clinical trials are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: The 'psychological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>,' represented by the reluctance of both patients and health-care professionals to initiate insulin therapy, could be won by alternative routes of insulin administration, improving patients' compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, Oralgen seems to be suitable to manage the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> without hypoglycemic risk, although no comparative studies with rapid-acting insulin analogs and no randomized controlled trials in large cohort subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are available to date </plain></SENT>
