<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term cardiovascular predictive value of cardiac (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy parameters in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy in 108 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who did not have structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The washout rate (WR) was considered enhanced if it was ≥40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accurate follow-up information for 4.6 years was obtained in 54 enhanced WR patients (27 male; mean age, 61 ± 11 years) and in 54 sex- and age-matched preserved WR patients (27 male; mean age, 61 ± 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 10 enhanced WR patients developed MACCE including cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, coronary revascularization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, while MACCE occurred in only 3 male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that enhanced WR patients had higher incidence of MACCE than those with preserved WR (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that age and enhanced WR were independently associated with the incidence of MACCE (hazard ratio, 4.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.194-18.76, P = 0.0237) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal WR of cardiac (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy at baseline has long-term cardiovascular predictive value in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
