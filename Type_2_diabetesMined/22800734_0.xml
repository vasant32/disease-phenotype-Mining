<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A case-control study included 234 cases with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 468 non diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A specifically designed questionnaire was used to collect information on possible risk factors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The speed of eating was self-reported by study subjects compared to other subjects, with whom they were eating at the same table </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were calculated by a conditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variables such as a family history on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, body mass index, waist circumference, educational level, morning exercise, smoking and plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> level were retained in multivariate logistic regression models as confounders because their inclusion changed the value of the OR by more than 5% in any exposure category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for possible confounders more than two-fold increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined for subjects eating faster (OR = 2.52; 95% CI 1.56-4.06) vs. subjects eating slower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a possible relationship between faster eating speed and the increased risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
