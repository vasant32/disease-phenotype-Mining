<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytokines are known to play an important role not only in the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal defects but also in the pathological processes occurring in the liver during <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the serum levels of many cytokines, chemokines, adipokines and growth factors in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, CHC, CHC-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, CHC and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHC-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by BioPlex assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The obtained data evidenced that the serum levels of some proteins are significantly up-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients or in those with only one disease and are often higher, even if in different amounts, when both diseases are associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, our results can be useful for the clinical monitoring of patients because they give specific information in regard to the progression from CHC to LC and CHD to LCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some molecules have shown significant correlations with clinical/biochemical data, suggesting the possibility to define mini-panels that can be used as specific markers for the different disease staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, our observations demonstrate that an integrated approach is much more powerful than isolated measurements to evaluate specific stages of these two complex pathologies (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> CHC <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>) alone or when they are concomitant in a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact it has emerged as an accurate, simple, specific, noninvasive, reproducible and less expensive method that, in future, could be included in routine clinical practice to monitor the association of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and/or CHC to liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and, possibly, to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and to improve the prognosis of these diseases </plain></SENT>
