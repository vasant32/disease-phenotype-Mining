<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined DM control, risk factors, and comorbidities among U.S. persons according to insulin treatment status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2003-2006, we examined in 10,637 adults aged â‰¥30 with type 2 DM the extent of control of A1c, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and blood pressure (BP) and composite goal attainment by insulin use status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 6.6% (n=889, projected to 14.3 million) had type 2 DM; of these, 22.9% were insulin users and 57.2% were treated only by other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 58.2% had an A1c&lt;7% (53 mmol/mol) (insulin users 33.1%, non-insulin treated 66.1%, and 77.9% of those not on medication, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 44.2% were at a BP goal of &lt;130/80 mmHg, 43.8% had an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>&lt;100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L), and 13.9% a BMI&lt;25 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 10.2% were simultaneously at A1c, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and BP goals (5.4% of those on insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: U.S. adults with type 2 DM, especially those treated with insulin remain inadequately controlled for A1c and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors and have a high prevalence of comorbidities </plain></SENT>
