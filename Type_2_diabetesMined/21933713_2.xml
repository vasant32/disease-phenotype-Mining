<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, female gender is a protective factor in the development of, for example, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate possible gender differences in the activation of Akt/eNOS signaling in aortas from a mouse type 2 diabetic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonfasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly above control in the diabetic mice (both males and females) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In diabetic males (vs male controls and/or diabetic females): (a) systemic blood pressure was elevated, (b) the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi>- and insulin-induced Akt-dependent aortic relaxations were impaired, but the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced Akt-independent and SNP-induced endothelium-independent aortic relaxations were not, (c) Akt and eNOS expression levels were lower, (d) both Akt phosphorylation at Ser(473) and eNOS phosphorylation at Ser(1177) in the aorta were lower under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi>- or insulin-stimulation, but not under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in mice: (i) endothelial functions mediated via the Akt/eNOS pathway are abrogated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only in males and (ii) in females (vs males), eNOS expression is elevated and the endothelium resists dysfunction </plain></SENT>
