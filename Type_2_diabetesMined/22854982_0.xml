<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reducing symptom burden is paramount at the end-of-life, but typically considered secondary to risk factor control in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the symptom burden experienced by adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the need for symptom palliation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine pain and non-pain symptoms of adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the disease course - at varying time points before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and by age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Survey follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 13,171 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 30-75 years, from Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, who answered a baseline symptom survey in 2005-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASURES: Pain and non-pain symptoms were identified by self-report and medical record data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival status from baseline was categorized into ≤6, &gt;6-24, or alive &gt;24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Mean age was 60 years; 48 % were women, and 43 % were non-white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> pain was prevalent (41.8 %) and 39.7 % reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain, 24.6 % <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, 23.7 % <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, 23.5 % <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, 24.2 % <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, and 15.6 % physical/emotional disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptom burden was prevalent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survival status categories, but was more prevalent among those with shorter survival, p &lt; .001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adults ≥60 years who were alive &gt;24 months reported more physical symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pain and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, whereas participants &lt;60 years reported more psychosocial symptoms, such as depressed mood and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and comorbidity reduced the association between age and pain, but did not otherwise change our results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, pain and non-pain symptoms were common among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, not only among those near the end of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, symptoms were more prevalent among patients with shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Older adults reported more physical symptoms, whereas younger adults reported more psychosocial symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> care management should include not only good cardiometabolic control, but also symptom palliation across the disease course </plain></SENT>
