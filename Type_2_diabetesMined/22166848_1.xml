<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A reduction of either blood pressure or glycemia decreases some microvascular complications of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and we studied here their combined effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In total, 4733 older adults with established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to intensive (systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg) or standard (systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg) blood pressure control, and separately to intensive (HbA1c less than 0.060) or standard (HbA1c 0.070-0.079) glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prespecified microvascular outcomes were a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and nine single outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazard regression models were used without correction for type I error due to multiple tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, the primary outcome occurred in 11.4% of intensive and 10.9% of standard blood pressure patients (hazard ratio 1.08), and in 11.1% of intensive and 11.2% of standard glycemia control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intensive blood pressure control only reduced the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (hazard ratio 0.84), and intensive glycemic control reduced the incidence of macroalbuminuria and a few other microvascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no interaction between blood pressure and glycemic control, and neither treatment prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in older patients with established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, intensive blood pressure control improved only 1 of 10 prespecified microvascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the outcomes were significantly reduced by simultaneous intensive treatment of glycemia and blood pressure, signifying the lack of an additional beneficial effect from combined treatment </plain></SENT>
