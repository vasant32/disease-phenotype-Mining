<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impairment of cellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> leads to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was the estimation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> indicators and the quantitative expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3 and GLUT-4 on peripheral blood lymphocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> subjects and persons with a positive family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 24 months of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 25 prediabetic subjects (according to WHO criteria) and 24 normoglycaemic individuals with a positive family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty three healthy subjects with no family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, matched with BMI, served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were recommended to perform physical activity for at least 140 minutes per week and to maintain a low calorie diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrating expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3 and GLUT-4 were labelled with the use of indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of GLUT isoforms was investigated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cells were stained by using anti-human GLUT antibodies and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-conjugated immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS Calibur (Becton-Dickinson) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we determined: fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), insulin and C <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations, HOMA-IR, BMI and WHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the tests were performed at baseline, and after 12 and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetics</z:e> and subjects with a positive family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were characterised by a much higher expression of GLUT-4 compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty four months of lifestyle modification resulted in significant lowering of the expression of GLUT-4 on the surface of PBL in both studied groups, with no differences in the expression of GLUT-1 or GLUT-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> subjects and individuals with a positive family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> revealed no significant differences in determined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> markers after 24 months of the observation compared to the baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The estimation of typical GLUT isoforms present on the peripheral blood lymphocytes, as well as the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> indicators, are obviously insufficient for monitoring the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> progression in the risk groups of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The decrease in GLUT-4 lymphocyte expression may reflect a positive influence of lifestyle modification on a tissue redistribution of this crucial insulin-dependent glucotransporter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The determination of GLUT-4 on the surface of peripheral blood lymphocytes can be a useful tool for the evaluation of the efficacy of therapeutic actions in subjects at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
