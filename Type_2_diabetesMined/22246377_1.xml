<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The main eligibility criteria for inclusion were: male/female (18-80 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> (ejection fraction ≤ 35%, and New York Heart Association functional class III or IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of 237 patients screened, 20 male type 2 diabetic patients participated in this crossover trial design and were allocated (sequentially numbered) to i.v. infusions during two consecutive days with (1) exenatide (0.12 pmol/kg/min); and (2) placebo for 6 h followed by a washout period for 18 h, at Stockholm South Hospital, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and researchers were blinded to the assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac haemodynamic variables were determined by right heart catheterisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was defined as an increase in cardiac index (CI) or a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of ≥ 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were tolerability and safety of exenatide infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CI increased at 3 and 6 h by 0.4 ± 0.1 (23%) and 0.33 ± 0.1 (17%) l min(-1) m(-2), during exenatide infusion vs -0.02 ± 0.1 (-1%) and -0.08 ± 0.1 (-5%) l min(-1) m(-2) during placebo (p = 0.003); and heart rate (HR) increased at 1, 3 and 6 h by 8 ± 3 (11%), 15 ± 4 (21%) and 21 ± 5 (29%) beats per min (bpm), during exenatide infusion vs -1 ± 2 (-2%), 1 ± 1 (2%) and 6 ± 2 (8%) bpm, during placebo (p = 0.006); and PCWP decreased at 1, 3 and 6 h by -1.3 ± 0.8 (-8%), -1.2 ± 1 (-8%) and -2.2 ± 0.9 (-15%) mmHg, during exenatide infusion vs 0.3 ± 0.5 (2%), 1 ± 0.6 (6%) and 1.4 ± 0.7 (8%) mmHg, during placebo (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse event was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were reported in nine patients (six, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>; two, increased HR; one, increased systolic blood pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Infusion of exenatide in male type 2 diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> increased the CI as a result of chronotropy, with concomitant favourable effects on PCWP and reasonable tolerability of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications of using exenatide in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> are still not clear and further studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
