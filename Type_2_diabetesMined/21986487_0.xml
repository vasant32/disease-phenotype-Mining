<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although Muslim patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be exempt from fasting during Ramadan for medical reasons, a high proportion of them fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the association between Ramadan fasting and glycemic control in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort clinical trial was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (45 male, 43 female, age 51±10 yr) who opted to fast for at least 10 days during the month of Ramadan were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood samples were taken at the beginning and end of Ramadan, and 1 month after Ramadan, to assess fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), fasting insulin, full blood count, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) and fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anthropometrics and blood pressure were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant deterioration in FBG and HbA1c (p=0.002 and p≤0.001, respectively) and significant improvements in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and body mass index after Ramadan (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, HbA1c showed a reduction 1 month after Ramadan (9.4±2% at the end of Ramadan vs 8.4±2.5% 1 month after Ramadan; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results from this study showed that fasting during Ramadan deteriorated the glycemic control in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was more evident in patients using oral hypoglycemic medication than diet- controlled patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, Ramadan fasting had small positive effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and body weight </plain></SENT>
