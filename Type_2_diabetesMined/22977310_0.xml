<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The kidney plays an important role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, and has been considered a target for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) mediates most of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reabsorption from the proximal renal tubule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> and provides a unique mechanism to lower elevated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to explore the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of SGLT2 and discuss several SGLT2 inhibitors which have clinical data in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the terms "SGLT2" and "SGLT2 inhibitor" through April 10, 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Published articles, press releases, and abstracts presented at national and international meetings were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an insulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> reduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, have a low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, complement the action of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, and can be used at any stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They are generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, due to side effects, such as repeated urinary tract and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001899'>increased hematocrit</z:hpo>, and decreased blood pressure, appropriate patient selection for drug initiation and close monitoring after initiation will be important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of ongoing clinical studies of the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> and cardiovascular safety are crucial to determine the risk-benefit ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A recent decision by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency has recommended approval of dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as an adjunct to diet and exercise, in combination with other <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medicinal products, including insulin, and as a monotherapy for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-intolerant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical research also remains to be carried out on the long-term effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> and other potential effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, especially in view of the observed increase in the incidence of bladder and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SGLT2 inhibitors represent a promising approach for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and could potentially be an addition to existing therapies </plain></SENT>
