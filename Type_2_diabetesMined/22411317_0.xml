<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The insulin receptor and part of the downstream signalling mediators are localized in or recruited to caveolae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as part of the signalling, insulin receptors are rapidly endocytosed by caveolae in response to the hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The insulin regulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter GLUT4 appears to localize to caveolae after insulin-stimulated translocation to the plasma membrane, while the endocytosis of GLUT4 may involve a clathrin-mediated process </plain></SENT>
