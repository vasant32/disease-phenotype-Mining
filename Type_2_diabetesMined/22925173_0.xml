<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this pooled analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of exenatide once weekly (EQW) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> grouped into subpopulations by key demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods:  This post hoc analysis included data from patients who received EQW in seven randomised, controlled phase 3 trials that were 24-30 weeks in duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into subpopulations on the basis of their baseline age (&lt; 65 or ≥ 65 years), gender (male or female), race (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&lt; 10 years, ≥ 10 years) and body mass index (BMI; &lt; 25, ≥ 25 to &lt; 30, ≥ 30 to &lt; 35, ≥ 35 to &lt; 40 or ≥ 40 kg/m(2) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results:  A total of 1719 patients were included in this analysis of patient subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subpopulations experienced significant improvements from baseline in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1C, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most subpopulations experienced significant improvements in blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the most common AEs were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (16.4% overall; 2.3% in patients not on concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (14.7%), diarrhoea (10.9%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nasopharyngitis</z:e> (7.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  These results show that the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with EQW for 24-30 weeks was associated with significant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight, irrespective of age, gender, race, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature </plain></SENT>
