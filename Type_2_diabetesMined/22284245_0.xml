<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether type 2 diabetic patients significantly differed in erythrocyte mechanical fragility as compared with nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 25 Caucasian patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (14 men and 11 women; mean age 58±8 years) and 25 age-, race- and sex-matched nondiabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fragility of erythrocytes was tested by inducing mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> by double <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of K(2)EDTA blood through a 0.5 mL insulin syringe equipped with a very thin needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma was then separated from the blood cells by centrifugation at 2000 xg for 15 min at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Beckman Coulter DxC 800 was used to measure the <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> index by direct spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with matched nondiabetic controls, type 2 diabetic patients had a significantly increased mechanical fragility of erythrocytes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> index ratio 21±13 vs. 14±10, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariable linear regression analysis revealed that there was a strong positive association between percent <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r=0.669, p&lt;0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (r=0.549, p&lt;0.005) in type 2 diabetic subjects, but not in matched nondiabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a significantly higher erythrocyte mechanical fragility than matched nondiabetic subjects, and that fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is the strongest correlate of increased mechanical fragility of erythrocytes in this patients group </plain></SENT>
