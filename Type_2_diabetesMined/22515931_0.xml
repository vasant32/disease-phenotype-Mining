<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T2D-associated polymorphisms were also examined for prediction of incident CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 113 tagging SNPs were genotyped in stage 1 (467 T2D cases, 290 controls), and 15 SNPs were analyzed in the final cohort (1462 T2D cases, 600 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three T2D-associated SNPs were further tested for prediction of CHD within a subset of 1417 T2D cases free of CHD at enrolment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the case-control analysis, PPARG rs1801282 (Pro12Ala) (OR=1.48 (1.02-2.16)), ADIPOQ rs1063539 (OR=1.17 (1.01-1.35)), and HNF4A rs1884614 (OR=1.16 (1.00-1.32) were associated with T2D (P(allelic)&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Joint analysis of rs1801282-C, rs1063539-G, and rs1884614-T risk alleles showed an additive dosage effect (P for trend=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, carriers with two PPARG rs1801282-C risk alleles were associated with an increased risk of incident CHD (HR=4.38 (1.03-18.57), P=0.045) in T2D patients in the prospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants of PPARG, ADIPOQ and HNF4A were individually and jointly associated with T2D in Hong Kong Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PPARG Pro12 risk allele contributed to increased risk for both T2D and CHD </plain></SENT>
