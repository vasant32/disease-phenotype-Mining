<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the relationship between <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels, symptoms of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> deficiency, erectile function and quality of life in men with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional study of 115 men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 93 men with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 121 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Total, bioavailable and free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels were measured or calculated by Vermuelen's formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quality of life and symptom scores were assessed by the Audit of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> deficiency in the aging male (ADAM) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five and sixty-one per cent of men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had low total and calculated free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (CFT) levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (TT) levels were not lowered in men with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but 32% had low CFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and waist circumference, only CFT in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (-0·037 nm, 95% CI -0·075 to -0·0003, P = 0.048) remained lowered compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CFT correlated weakly with ADAM (r = -0·26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0·08, P = 0·006), IIEF (r = 0.19, 95% CI 0.01-0.37, P = 0.042) and ADDQoL (r = 0.21, 95% CI 0·03 to 0·38, P = 0·022) scores in men with type 2, but not type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age exerted the predominant effect on erectile function in both groups, in a model incorporating age, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> level and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> levels are strongly affected by age and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in men with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but correlate weakly with symptoms of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> deficiency and erectile function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> levels do not appear to be a major determinant of quality of life in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
