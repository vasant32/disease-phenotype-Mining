<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the renal function in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by using different formulas of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and to assess the contribution of cystatin C; 83 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (23 men and 60 women) and 83 adult controls (40 men and 43 women) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biochemical parameters were determinated on Coba 6000â„¢ (Roche diagnostics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetics showed a significant increase in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, LDLc, the ApoB, Lp(a), <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and cystatin C and lower HDLc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cystatin was increased in patients with degenerative complications and in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found strong correlations of cystatin C with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (r = 0.9454), <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> (r = 0.8999) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (r = 0.8325) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a significant exponentially increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and cystatin C from one stage to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cystatin C has a strong association with MDRD (r = 0.8086) and CG (r = 0.7915) and a low one with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (r = 0.1044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the use of cystatin C for screening and early treatment of incipient diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> appears to be adequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CG and MDRD formulas still hold their place, in regards to the classical determination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, to monitor patients </plain></SENT>
