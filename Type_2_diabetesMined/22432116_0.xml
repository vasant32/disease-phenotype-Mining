<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate renal outcomes and survival in youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) versus type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1DM) versus nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In total, 342 prevalent youth (aged 1-18 years) with T2DM, 1,011 youth with T1DM, and 1,710 control subjects identified from 1986 to 2007 were anonymously linked to health care records housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy to assess long-term outcomes using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Youth with T2DM were found to have a fourfold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> versus youth with T1DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> were renin angiotensin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system inhibitor use and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects (age, sex, and postal code matched), youth with T2DM had a 23-fold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and a 39-fold increased risk of dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival at 10 years was 91.4% in the type 2 diabetic group versus 99.5% in the type 1 diabetic group (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Renal survival was 100% at 10 years in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It decreased to 92.0% at 15 years and 55.0% at 20 years in the type 2 diabetic group but remained stable in the type 1 diabetic group (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Youth with T2DM are at high risk of adverse renal outcomes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> and angiotensin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system inhibitor use, which may be a marker of severity of disease, are associated with poor outcomes in early adulthood </plain></SENT>
