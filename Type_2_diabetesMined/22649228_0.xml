<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings in db/db mice, a model of T2DM, we observed that, in addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0008814'>reduced nerve conduction velocity</z:mp>, db/db mice also develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using pharmacological inhibitors, we demonstrated that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is mediated by the decreased activity of K(v)1-channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these data, we observed that the diabetic condition led to a reduced presence of the K(v)1.2-subunits in juxtaparanodal regions of peripheral nerves in db/db mice and in nerve biopsies from T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations indicate that the T2DM condition leads to <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, thus identifying them as a potential drug target to treat some of the DPN related symptoms </plain></SENT>
