<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is one of the most common non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e> globally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study seeks to estimate the prevalence of impaired fasting glycemia and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in genetically isolated populations in Jordan: the Circassians and Chechans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from a cross-sectional study that included a random sample of adult Circassians and Chechans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subject was defined as affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> if diagnosis was known to patient or, according to the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was defined as a fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of â‰¥6.1 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) but &lt;7 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) &gt;7% was defined as 'unsatisfactory' metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of impaired fasting glycemia was 18.5% for Circassians and 14.6% for Chechans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 9.6% for Circassians and 10.1% for Chechans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of impaired fasting glycemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly higher in men, older age groups, married, subjects of lower educational level, past smokers, and subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was the most common abnormality in the two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The homogenous, genetically isolated Circassian and Chechan populations sharing the same environmental influences suggest a role for genetic risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus these two populations are suitable for additional genetics studies that may lead to the identification of novel risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, more than half of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were with unsatisfactory control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, they are likely to benefit from programs encouraging healthy weight and physical activity </plain></SENT>
