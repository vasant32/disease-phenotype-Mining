<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approximately 215,000 people younger than 20 yr of age, or 1 in 500 children and adolescents, had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the United States in 2010--and the incidence is rising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We still have insufficient knowledge about the precise mechanisms leading to the autoimmune mediated β-cell destruction in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the β-cell failure associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term complications are similar: micro- and macrovascular disease occurs prematurely and presents an enormous burden on affected individuals, often as early as in middle age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, technological advances have clearly improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> management, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> peripheral over-insulinization remains a problem even with the most advanced systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> our research must focus on 1) finding the stimulus that ignites the immune response and 2) developing treatments that avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth, the challenges start much earlier: most young patients do not even benefit from existing therapies due to non-compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, prevention of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and improvement of compliance, especially with non-pharmacological interventions, are the greatest challenges </plain></SENT>
