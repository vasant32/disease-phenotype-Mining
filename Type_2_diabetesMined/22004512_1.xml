<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and plasma insulin, GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) responses to intraduodenal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and compared these with data from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight males with well-controlled Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, managed by diet alone, were studied on four occasions in single-blind, randomized order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and plasma insulin, GLP-1, and GIP were measured during 120-min intraduodenal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusions at 1 kcal/min (G1), 2 kcal/min (G2) and 4 kcal/min (G4) or saline control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 patients had higher basal (P &lt; 0.0005) and incremental (P &lt; 0.0005) blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responses to G2 and G4, when compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the stimulation of insulin and GLP-1 by increasing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loads was not linear; responses to G1 and G2 were minimal, whereas responses to G4 were much greater (P &lt; 0.005 for each) (incremental area under the GLP-1 curve 224 ± 65, 756 ± 331 and 2807 ± 473 pmol/l.min, respectively, in Type 2 patients and 373 ± 231, 505 ± 161 and 1742 ± 456 pmol/l.min, respectively, in healthy controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GLP-1 responses appeared comparable in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups there was a load-dependent increase in plasma GIP with no difference between them </plain></SENT>
