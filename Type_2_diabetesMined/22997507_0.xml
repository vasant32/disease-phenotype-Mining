<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> with trait and state psychological factors in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7872">OXT</z:chebi> and psychological variables were analyzed from 86 controlled diabetic patients (glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) &lt; 7%) from 45 uncontrolled diabetic patients (HbA1c â‰¥ 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Psychological characteristics were assessed with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), while state psychological characteristics were measured with the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL 90-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken for measuring <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> in both subgroups during the initial phase of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One year later, the uncontrolled diabetic patients were reevaluated with the use of the same psychometric instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the first evaluation of the uncontrolled diabetic patients, a statistically significant positive relationship between the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7872">OXT</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687131" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoticism</z:e> in EPQ rating scale (P &lt; 0.013) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For controlled diabetic patients, a statistically significant negative relationship between <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149779" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">somatization</z:e> (P &lt; 0.030), as well as obsessive-compulsive scores (P &lt; 0.047) in SCL-90 rating scale, was observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7872">OXT</z:chebi> is in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687131" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoticism</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149779" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">somatization</z:e>, and obsessionality may be implicated in T2DM </plain></SENT>
