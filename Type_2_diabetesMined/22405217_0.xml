<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In cardiovascular research, Type D personality (high negative affectivity and social inhibition) has been associated with a more than 3-fold increased risk of adverse health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the validity and clinical correlates of the Type D construct as assessed by the Type D Scale-14 (DS14) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1553 primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed for demographic, clinical, lifestyle and psychological characteristics in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subgroup (n=1012) completed the DS14 again 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two-factor model of the Type D construct was confirmed in exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses; results were stable across gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Negative Affectivity (NA) and Social Inhibition (SI) subscales had adequate reliability in both men and women, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (NA=0.87, SI=0.83), lambda2 (NA=0.87/0.88, SI=0.84), corrected item-total correlations (NA 0.47-0.77, SI 0.34-0.72) and mean inter-item correlations (NA=0.50/0.51, SI=0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One year test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients was 0.64/0.63 for NA and 0.73/0.65 for SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type D and non-Type D patients did not differ in vascular history or physiological risk factors, but Type D women had a more sedentary lifestyle (p=.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type D patients experienced less social support and more stressful life events, loneliness, and more depressed mood, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (p&lt;.001 for most variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These differences were clinically significant (Cohen's d&gt;0.60 for most variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Type D personality can be reliably assessed in primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and is associated with increased loneliness, stress and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
