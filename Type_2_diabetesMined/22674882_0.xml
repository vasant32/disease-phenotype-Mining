<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> dinicocysteinate (CDNC), a complex of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> and l-cysteine, is beneficial in lowering <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp>, and glycemia in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic subjects enrolled in this study were given placebo for 1 month for stabilization and then randomized into one of three groups: placebo (P), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50369">chromium picolinate</z:chebi> (CP), or CDNC, after which they received daily oral supplementation for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 100 patients enrolled in the study, 74 patients completed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 25 patients in the P supplemented group, 25 in the CP supplemented and 24 in the CDNC supplemented group who completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood markers of glycemia, <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp>, HOMA <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> were determined at randomization and after 3 months of supplementation with P, CP, or CDNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease at 3 months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (p = 0.02) and in the levels of protein oxidation (p = 0.02) and TNF-α (p = 0.01) in the CDNC supplemented cohort compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistically significant change in these markers in the CP supplemented group compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels significantly decreased (p = 0.01) for subjects receiving CDNC but not CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant impact of supplementation on HbA(1c) or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in either of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CDNC supplementation lowers <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by reducing blood levels of TNF-α, insulin, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CDNC supplementation has potential as an adjunct therapy for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
