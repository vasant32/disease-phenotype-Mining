<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011877'>Increased mean platelet volume</z:hpo> (MPV) is a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011869'>abnormal platelet function</z:hpo> and activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the possible association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF with MPV in patients who have type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had type 2 DM with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (≥6 months) AF or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm (NSR) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 162 patients (aged 38-89 years) were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of either AF or NSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 81 diabetic patients with AF, and group 2 consisted of 81 diabetic patients with NSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two groups were not significantly different in terms of age, and gender, as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, duration of DM, body mass index, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (p &gt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no significant difference was present between groups concerning platelet count; for patients with AF, MPV was higher compared with patients with NSR (9.0 ± 0.2 fl vs. 8.4 ± 0.2 fl; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no significant difference was noted between groups regarding routine medications received by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, MPV was the only variable independently related to AF (OR = 2.659; 95% CI, 1.286-5.498; p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is concluded that AF is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002599'>increased MPV</z:mp> in patients with type 2 DM, suggesting the presence of tentatively related processes leading to reciprocal interaction </plain></SENT>
