<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the therapeutic potential of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFRtk) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibition in impaired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neovascularization in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral femoral artery ligation was performed in diabetic (db(-)/db(-)) and their control (db(-)/db(+)) mice for 4 weeks, followed by treatments with EGFRtk and ERK1/2 inhibitors (AG1478, 10 mg/kg/day and U0126, 400 Î¼g/kg/day, respectively) for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neovascularization, blood flow recovery, vascular and capillary density, and endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity were significantly impaired and were associated with enhanced EGFRtk and ERK1/2 activity in db(-)/db(-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EGFRtk and ERK1/2 inhibitors did not have any effect in control mice, while in db(-)/db(-) mice there was a significant increase in neovascularization, blood flow recovery, vascular and capillary density, endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity, and were associated with a decrease in EGFRtk and ERK1/2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated that the inhibition of EGFRtk and ERK1/2 restored <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neovascularization and blood flow recovery in type 2 diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, EGFRtk and ERK1/2 could be possible targets to protect from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced vascular pathology in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
