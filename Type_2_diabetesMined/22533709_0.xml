<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association of the CTGF -945 G/C promoter variant with cardiac complications (left ventricular (LV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (LVH), diastolic and systolic dysfunction) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CTGF -945 G/C polymorphism (rs6918698) was examined in 495 Caucasian subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac structure and function were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kidney function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, and CKD defined as the presence of kidney damage (decreased kidney function (eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age ± SD of the cohort was 62 ± 14 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 31 ± 6 kg/m2 and median <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 11 years [25th, 75th interquartile range; 5, 18] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0003116'>abnormal echocardiogram</z:hpo> was present in 73% of subjects; of these, 8% had LVH alone, 74% had diastolic dysfunction and 18% had systolic ± diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CKD was present in 42% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations between the CTGF -945 G/C polymorphism and echocardiographic parameters of LV mass or cardiac function, or kidney function both before and after adjustment for covariates of age, gender, BMI, blood pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CTGF -945 genotypes were not associated with the cardiac complications of LVH, diastolic or systolic dysfunction, nor with CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Caucasians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, genetic variation in the CTGF -945 G/C polymorphism is not associated with cardiac or kidney complications </plain></SENT>
