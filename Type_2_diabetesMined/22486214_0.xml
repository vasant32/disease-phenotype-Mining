<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) is one of the most serious complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong evidence suggests that several growth factors may contribute to the initiation and progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, there is an overexpression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in renal biopsies from patients with DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of urinary PDGF-BB level in type 2 diabetic patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and to evaluate its relationship with various clinical and laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Urinary levels of PDGF-BB were measured in 60 Egyptian type 2 diabetic patients categorized into three equal groups (normo-, micro-, and macroalbuminuria), according to urinary albumin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 20 healthy subjects were selected to serve as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The urinary PDGF-BB levels were significantly increased in type 2 diabetic patients as compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, diabetics with micro- and macroalbuminuria had significantly higher levels than in those with normoalbuminuria (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urinary PDGF-BB correlated positively with disease duration, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>)-cholesterol, and urinary albumin and negatively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a multiple regression model, urinary PDGF-BB was strongly and independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in diabetic patients (Î² = -0.03, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PDGF-BB may play an important role in the initiation and progression of DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is considered as a good predictor for early deterioration of renal function in DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, measurement of urinary PDGF-BB in type 2 diabetic patients could be used for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
