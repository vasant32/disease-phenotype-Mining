<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between age at menarche and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and whether childhood, adolescent or adult BMI attenuates this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, a British birth cohort study of men and women born in 1946, with contemporaneous recording of the age of menarche, BMI at 2, 7, 15 and 20-53 years and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status to 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant inverse relationship between age at menarche and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [hazard ratio = 0.73 per year older age at menarche (95% CI 0.56-0.96), P = 0.02] was attenuated by adjustment for adult BMI [hazard ratio 0.85 (95% CI 0.65-1.10), P = 0.2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of age at menarche on Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was very similar to that for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of the association between age at menarche and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also observed with BMI at 15 years, but less so with BMI measured earlier in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Earlier age at menarche is associated with a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and specifically Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in later life, which is most strongly attenuated by adolescent and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early menarche may be clinically useful in identifying women who are at risk of later <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and so of developing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
