<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With an increasing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, this risk has increased further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Management of T2DM in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients is particularly challenging as treatment with the majority of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents results in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the development of a therapeutic option which could improve glycemic control without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, such as the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) analog exenatide, is a welcome addition to the currently available therapies in the management of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With recognition and better understanding of the role of incretin hormones in T2DM, exenatide was developed and introduced into clinical practice in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both randomized controlled trials and retrospective observational studies have shown that treatment with exenatide not only improves glycemic control, with a low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, but also results in concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and the additional benefit of improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article will provide an overview of both short- and long-acting exenatide in the management of T2DM and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
