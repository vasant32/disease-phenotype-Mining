<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous loci conferring susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) have been identified worldwide, with most having been identified in European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In terms of ethnic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in pathogenesis as well as disease predisposition, it is imperative to explore the specific genetic architecture of T2D in Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Replication studies of European-derived susceptibility loci have been performed, validating 11 of 32 loci in Chinese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic investigations into heritable traits related to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism are expected to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of T2D, and such studies have already inferred some new susceptibility loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other than replication studies of European-derived loci, efforts have been made to identify specific susceptibility loci in Chinese populations using methods such as genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These efforts have identified additional new loci for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies can facilitate the prediction of risk for T2D and also promote individualized anti-diabetic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite many advances in the field of risk prediction and pharmacogenetics, the pace of clinical application of these findings is rather slow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, more studies into the practical utility of these findings remain necessary </plain></SENT>
