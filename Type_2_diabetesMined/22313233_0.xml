<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 2007, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(AHRQ) published a systematic review on the comparative effectiveness of oral medications for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The review included studies on the benefits and risks of oral medications used for achieving glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AHRQ published an updated review in March 2011 that summarized the benefits and harms of medications (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>,second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, meglitinides,dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>), as monotherapy and in combination, for the treatment of adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To (a) familiarize health care professionals with the methods and findings from AHRQ's 2011 comparative effectiveness review on medications for adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, (b) encourage consideration of the clinical and managed care applications of the review findings, and(c) identify limitations and gaps in the existing research with respect to the benefits and risks of oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a major public health burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the 2007 AHRQ systematic review of oral medications for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the FDA has approved several new drug classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in 2011, the original systematic review was updated with comparisons including the newer oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The updated report expands beyond the scope of the original 2007 review by including comparisons of 2-drug combinations and the addition of more head-to-head comparisons, as well as additional adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A high strength of evidence showed that most medications were similarly efficacious at lowering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c by about 1 absolute percentage point compared with baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of most oral medications to initial monotherapy further improved glycemiccontrol by lowering A1c by another 1 percentage point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only exception was the DPP-4 inhibitor class, which did not lower A1c to the same extent as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> when used as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was found to have a more favorable effect on body weight when compared with other medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two-drug combinations compared with each other demonstrated similar reductions in A1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> decreased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>,and DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylureas</z:chebi> had a 4-fold higher risk of mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone, and, in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, had more than a 5-fold increased risk compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus a thiazolidinedione </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> had an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, and an increased risk for bone fractures relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> occurred more often for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> users compared with thiazolidinedione users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although the long-term risks and benefits of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications remain unclear, the evidence supports the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as a first-line agent </plain></SENT>
