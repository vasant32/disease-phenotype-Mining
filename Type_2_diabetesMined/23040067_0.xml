<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The repertoire and regulation of lncRNAs in disease-relevant tissues, however, has not been systematically explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a comprehensive strand-specific transcriptome map of human pancreatic islets and β cells, and uncover &gt;1100 intergenic and antisense islet-cell lncRNA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find islet lncRNAs that are dynamically regulated and show that they are an integral component of the β cell differentiation and maturation program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the mouse islet transcriptome and identify lncRNA orthologs that are regulated like their human counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of HI-LNC25, a β cell-specific lncRNA, downregulated GLIS3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, thus exemplifying a gene regulatory function of islet lncRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, selected islet lncRNAs were dysregulated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or mapped to genetic loci underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings reveal a new class of islet-cell genes relevant to β cell programming and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
