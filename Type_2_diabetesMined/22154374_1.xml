<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore this study was designed to assess the association between both gene polymorphisms with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in Malaysian diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 342 type 2 diabetic patients [171 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DNR) and 171 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR)] and 235 healthy controls were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was obtained from blood samples and the screening for the gene polymorphisms was done using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the genotype distribution for both polymorphisms was not statistically different (p&gt;0.05) among the control, DNR and DR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The -429C minor allele frequency of DR group (12.0%) was not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) when compared to DNR group (16.1%) and healthy controls (11.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The -374A allele frequency also did not differ significantly between the control and DNR (p&gt;0.05), control and DR (p&gt;0.05) as well as DNR and DR groups (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first study report on RAGE gene polymorphism in Malaysian DR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, -429T/C and -374T/A polymorphisms in the promoter region of RAGE gene were not associated with Malaysian type 2 DR patients </plain></SENT>
