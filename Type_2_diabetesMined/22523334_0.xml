<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the evidence currently available to examine the potential role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in chemoprevention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: The data sources of the study included the PubMed and SciVerse Scopus databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Selection included studies that assessed the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Summary effect estimates were derived using a random-effects meta-analysis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: A database was developed on the basis of five studies consisting of approximately 105,495 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In meta-analyses, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was associated with an estimated 62% reduction in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.24, 0.59; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect estimates were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> across the five included studies (P for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.001; I(2) = 78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When restricting the analysis to the four studies related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was again associated with a significantly lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.17, 0.52; P &lt; 0.001), and there was evidence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between these four studies (P for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.03; I(2) = 67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> appears to be associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigation, including mechanistic studies, well-designed cohort studies, and possibly controlled trials, is needed </plain></SENT>
