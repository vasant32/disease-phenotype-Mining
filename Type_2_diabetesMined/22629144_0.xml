<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, six Iberian sows had ad libitum access to food enriched with saturated fat (SFAD group; food consumption was estimated to be 4.5 kg/animal/day) whilst four females acted as controls and were fed with 2 kg/animal/day of a commercial maintenance diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After three months of differential feeding, SFAD animals developed central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and elevated blood pressure; the five parameters associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the current study characterizes the Iberian pig as a robust, amenable, and reliable translational model for studies on nutrition-associated diseases </plain></SENT>
