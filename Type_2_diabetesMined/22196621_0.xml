<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systemically acting glucokinase activators (liver and pancreas) have been reported to be efficacious but in many cases present <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> risk due to activation of the enzyme at low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in the pancreas, leading to inappropriately excessive insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was therefore postulated that a liver selective activator may offer effective glycemic control with reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report structure-activity studies on a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi> containing series of glucokinase activators with preferential activity in hepatocytes versus pancreatic Î²-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These activators were designed to have low passive permeability thereby minimizing distribution into extrahepatic tissues; concurrently, they were also optimized as substrates for active liver uptake via members of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anion</z:chebi> transporting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (OATP) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies lead to the identification of 19 as a potent glucokinase activator with a greater than 50-fold liver-to-pancreas ratio of tissue distribution in rodent and non-rodent species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In preclinical diabetic animals, 19 was found to robustly lower fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, leading to its selection as a clinical development candidate for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
