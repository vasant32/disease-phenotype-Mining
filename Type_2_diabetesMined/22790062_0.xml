<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to explore the association between the established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus KCNQ1 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 6,667 and 6,606 diabetic case-control samples from Shanghai and Hong Kong, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the samples, 7.5% and 6.3% were excluded because of genotyping failure or data missing in the association analyses of rs2237892 and rs2237895 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>/BMI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that rs2237892 was associated with lower BMI and lower incidence of overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in diabetic patients from Hong Kong (BMI, β = -0.0060 per <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk C allele for log(10)BMI [95% CI -0.0088, -0.0032; p = 2.83 × 10(-5)]; overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, OR 0.880 for C allele [95% CI 0.807, 0.960; p = 0.004]) and in the meta-analysis of cases from the two regions (BMI, combined β = -0.0048 per C allele for log(10)BMI [95% CI -0.0070, -0.0026; p = 2.20 × 10(-5)]; overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, combined OR 0.890 for C allele [95% CI 0.830, 0.955; p = 0.001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rs2237895 was also related to <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>decreased BMI</z:mp> (combined β = -0.0042 per <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk C allele for log(10)BMI [95% CI -0.0062, -0.0022; p = 4.30 × 10(-5)]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association with waist circumference was detected for rs2237892 in the pooled analyses (β = -0.0026 per C allele for log(10)[waist circumference] [95% CI -0.0045, -0.0007; p = 0.007]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, neither an association with the risk of being overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nor associations with quantitive traits were detected for rs2237892 or rs2237895 in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that KCNQ1 is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
