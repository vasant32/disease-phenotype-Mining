<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum level of adiponectin is elevated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we measured serum levels of total and high molecular weight adiponectin in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the relationship between the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> and various clinical variables in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 105 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>Orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> was defined as a decrease of 20 mmHg or more in systolic blood pressure and/or 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure when blood pressure was measured for 3 min while standing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity was also measured as an index of arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>Orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> was found in 30 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (28.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The haematocrit and estimated glomerular filtration rate were significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> than in those without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity and serum total and high molecular weight adiponectin were significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the high molecular weight/total adiponectin ratio was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> than in those without and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was more common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plasma prothrombin F1 + 2, a coagulation maker, was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> than in those without, while there were no differences of fibrinolytic markers between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, haematocrit, F1 + 2, brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity and a decline of systolic blood pressure on standing were independent determinants of high molecular weight adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> had an elevated serum level of high molecular weight adiponectin, which was associated with the simultaneous presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, arterial stiffness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
