<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a major contributing factor to the elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality, the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in bipolar patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There may be shared pathophysiology linking the two disorders, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, common genetic links, and epigenetic interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Life-style, phenomenology of bipolar symptoms, and adverse effects of pharmacotherapy may be contributing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD and T2DM have a more severe course of illness and are more refractory to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is poorer when compared to diabetics without BD, and an existing disparity in medical care may be partly responsible </plain></SENT>
