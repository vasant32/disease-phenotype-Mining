<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several small, uncontrolled studies have found improvements in self-care behaviors and reductions in clinical risk in persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who received care from licensed naturopathic physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To extend these findings and determine the feasibility and promise of a randomized clinical trial, we conducted a prospective study to measure the effects of adjunctive naturopathic care (ANC) in primary care patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were invited from a large integrated health care system to receive up to eight ANC visits for up to one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were required to have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) values between 7.5-9.5 % and at least one additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> or overweight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standardized instruments were administered by telephone to collect outcome data on self-care, self-efficacy, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> problem areas, perceived stress, motivation, and mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline scores were calculated at 6- and 12-months after entry into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six and 12-month changes in clinical risk factors (i.e., HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and blood pressure) were calculated for the ANC cohort, and compared to changes in a cohort of 329 eligible, non-participating patients constructed using electronic medical records data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between-cohort comparisons were adjusted for age, gender, baseline HbA1c, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six months was pre-specified as the primary endpoint for outcome assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants made 3.9 ANC visits on average during the year, 78 % of which occurred within six months of entry into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 6-months, significant improvements were found in most patient-reported measures, including <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing (P = 0.001), diet (P = 0.001), physical activity (P = 0.02), mood (P = 0.001), self-efficacy (P = 0.0001) and motivation to change lifestyle (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing, mood, self-efficacy and motivation to change lifestyle persisted at 12-months (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For clinical outcomes, mean HbA1c decreased by -0.90 % (P = 0.02) in the ANC cohort at 6-months, a -0.51 % mean difference compared to usual care (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reductions at 12-months were not statistically significant (-0.34 % in the ANC cohort, P = 0.14; -0.37 % difference compared to the usual care cohort, P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improvements were noted in self-monitoring of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, diet, self-efficacy, motivation and mood following initiation of ANC for patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Study participants also experienced reductions in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> that exceeded those for similar patients who did not receive ANC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Randomized clinical trials will be necessary to determine if ANC was responsible for these benefits </plain></SENT>
