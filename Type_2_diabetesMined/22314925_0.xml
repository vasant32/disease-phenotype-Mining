<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied label-free differential protein expression analysis using multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to explore the proteomic profile of saliva samples collected from selected type 2 diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">edentulous</z:e> patients and non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> corresponding to 52 proteins were differentially expressed between the diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">edentulous</z:e> patients and controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related inflammatory biomarkers including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and serum amyloid A were detected with levels increased in diabetic samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other biomarkers including amylase, palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated protein (PLUNC), and serotransferrin levels were decreased in diabetic samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast with previous findings, salivary carbonic anhydrase 6 and alpha-2 macroglobulin levels, however, were decreased in this diabetic patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis and principle component analysis demonstrated a differential pattern of protein biomarker expression between diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was completed to confirm the relatively lower expression level of two biomarkers, including PLUNC and amylase in the diabetic group compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of salivary biomarkers specific for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">edentulous</z:e> subjects mimics those in serum, especially those related to inflammatory/<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While this exploratory study requires further validation with a larger population, it provides proof-of-principle for salivary proteomics for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">edentulous</z:e> subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
