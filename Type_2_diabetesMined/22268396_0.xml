<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective was to review type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, its influence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> and prognosis, and the interactions with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consideration was given to the responsible biological mechanisms and how these relate to the potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, notably <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most epidemiological studies indicate that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a modest positive risk factor for postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>; indeed before the menopause it may be associated with a reduced risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pattern of differing effects on risk according to menopausal status is well established in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>; however, although most type 2 diabetics are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, the relationship with postmenopausal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> does not appear to be a function of the body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that before menopause the protective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may modify any adverse effects of the metabolic changes related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regardless of menopausal status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> that exhibit aggressive biological characteristics at the time of diagnosis and have a poor prognosis; a similar relationship is emerging for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> share biological mechanisms for their associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, including a direct effect of insulin on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell proliferation, increased extraglandular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> production and bioavailability, changes in the adipokines, notably adiponectin, and activation of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These mechanistic considerations are consistent with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> having high potential as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> chemopreventive and therapeutic agent </plain></SENT>
