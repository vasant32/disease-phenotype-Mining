<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, varying by ethnicity, has been found in a number of populations worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been few opportunities to explore the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> while adjusting for other risk factors in the different ethnic groups in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and ethnicity using cross-sectional data from a large cohort study of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> conducted in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population was 65 171 adults in primary care with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, not on renal replacement therapy; median age was 64.7 years, median <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 5.1 years and 48.5% were non-European </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> or greater was present in 50% of Maori, 49% of Pacific people, 31% of Indo- and East-Asians and 28% of Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses were used to examine the association between ethnicity and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>-measured as albumin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio-after controlling for study site and other known risk variables: age, sex, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking status, socioeconomic status, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, HbA(1C) and being on an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After controlling for these risk factors and compared with Europeans, odds ratios for 'advanced' <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (≥100 mg/mmol) were 3.9 (95% confidence interval: 3.2-4.6) in Maori, 4.7 (3.6-6.3) in Pacific people, 2.0 (1.5-2.7) in Indo-Asians and 4.1 (3.2-5.1) in East-Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-European ethnicities appear to carry significantly higher risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
