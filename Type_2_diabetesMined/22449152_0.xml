<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared the gastrointestinal transit of radiopaque particles between diabetic and non-diabetic healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: abdominal radiographies were performed for 45 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients and 35 healthy individuals (gender and age similar for both groups) at 24 and 72 h after they ingested radiopaque particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean number of particles in the colon was compared for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were expressed as mean and standard deviation values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: at 24 h, the total number of particles in the colon did not differ significantly for the diabetic and non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours, the distribution in the diabetic and non-diabetic individuals was as follows: right colon, 0.44 ± 0.88 and 0.26 ± 0.7, respectively (p = 0.8); left colon, 2.6 ± 4.2 and 0.49 ± 1.3 (p &lt; 0.003); and rectosigmoid colon, 2.65 ± 3.8 and 0.80 ± 1.5 (p &lt; 0.005).The mean number of radiopaque particles in the entire colon was 5.7 ± 7.1 and 1.5 ± 2.7 for diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: the number of radiopaque particles in the colon did not significantly differ for the diabetic and non-diabetic individuals at 24 h after ingestion but was significantly greater in diabetic individuals at 72 h after ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 72 h, the mean number of radiopaque particles in the left and rectosigmoid colon were significantly higher in the diabetics than in the non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
