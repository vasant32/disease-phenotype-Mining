<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impairment of the circadian clock by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand whether and how the function of circadian clock is impaired under the diabetic condition, we examined not only the expression of circadian genes in the heart and pineal gland but also the behavioral rhythm of type 2 diabetic and control rats in both the nighttime restricted feeding (NRF) and daytime restricted feeding (DRF) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the NRF condition, the circadian expression of clock genes in the heart and pineal gland was conserved in the diabetic rats, being similar to that in the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DRF shifted the circadian phases of peripheral clock genes more efficiently in the diabetic rats than those in the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the activity rhythm of rats in the diabetic group was completely shifted from the dark phase to the light phase after 5 days of DRF treatment, whereas the activity rhythm of rats in the control group was still under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29425">(SCN)</z:chebi> after the same DRF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> rhythm of type 2 diabetic rats was also shifted and controlled by the external feeding schedule, ignoring the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, DRF shows stronger effect on the reentrainment of circadian rhythm in the type 2 diabetic rats, suggesting that the circadian system in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is unstable and more easily shifted by feeding stimuli </plain></SENT>
