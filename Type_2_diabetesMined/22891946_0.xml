<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the association between apoA-IV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, cardiovascular endpoints and parameters of protein-energy <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> and nutrition in haemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This post hoc analysis was performed in the German <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Dialysis Study (4D Study) evaluating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> in 1255 haemodialysis patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> followed for a median of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between apoA-IV and relevant outcomes was analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) was used as a marker of protein-energy <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a definition of extended <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> was applied, combining median values of BMI, serum albumin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and sensitive C-reactive protein, to classify patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (±SD) apoA-IV concentration was 49.8±14.2 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted apoA-IV concentrations were strongly associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> at baseline [odds ratio=0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.88 per 10 mg/dL increase; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the prospective follow-up, the strongest association was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR)=0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.95, P=0.001), which was mainly due to patients with BMI &gt;23 kg/m² (HR=0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.94, P&lt;0.001) and those in the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> group according to the extended definition (HR=0.89, 95% CI 0.84-0.96, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association remained significant after additionally adjusting for parameters associated with apoA-IV at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further associations were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ApoA-IV was less strongly associated with atherogenic events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low apoA-IV levels seem to be a risk predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
