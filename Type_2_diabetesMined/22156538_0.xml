<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the Early Pregnancy Unit database to identify singleton pregnancies with measurements of embryonic crown-rump length (CRL) and YSD at 6-10 weeks of gestation and subsequent delivery of phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the YSD in patients with pre-gestational and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> with those who were unaffected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3,686 cases were identified including 43 (1.2%) with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 31 (0.8%) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 71 (1.9%) who subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measured YSD in both the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were expressed as differences from the expected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean for CRL (Δ values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in ΔYSD between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median (IQR) ΔYSD was 0.01 (-0.33 to 0.37) mm in the unaffected group, 0.01 (-0.35 to 0.51) mm in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, -0.02 (-3.44 to 0.27) mm in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 0.01 (-0.28 to 0.35) mm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After exclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathies</z:e>, pre-gestational and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> are not associated with altered YSD </plain></SENT>
