<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of experimental models of DN has provided valuable information regarding many aspects of DN, including pathophysiology, progression, implicated genes, and new therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large number of mouse models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been identified and their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> was characterized to various degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most experimental models of type 2 DN are helpful in studying early stages of DN, but these models have not been able to reproduce the characteristic features of more advanced DN in humans such as nodules in the glomerular tuft or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The generation of new experimental models of DN created by crossing, knockdown, or knockin of genes continues to provide improved tools for studying DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These models provide an opportunity to search for new mechanisms involving the development of DN, but their shortcomings should be recognized as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is important to recognize that the genetic background has a substantial effect on the susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> development in the various models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
