<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such population is women with a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study of 101 women who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> in Australia, ethnicity was a major risk factor for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> following a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a mean followup of 5.5 years after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, South Asian women had a significantly higher risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) (69%) than women of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other ethnicities (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> was also very high amongst other groups: South East and East Asian (11/27, 41%), Middle-Eastern (8/18, 44%), South European backgrounds (5/12, 42%), and Australian-born women 39% (11/28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature supports the role of ethnicity in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> amongst these women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for South Asian countries and countries such as Australia where there is a population from diverse ethnic backgrounds and where the implementation of targeted measures to stem the growing tide of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is needed </plain></SENT>
