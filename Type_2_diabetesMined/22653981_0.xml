<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using a nested case-control analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Over 600 general practices in the United Kingdom contributing to the general practice research database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: The cohort consisted of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were newly treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> occurring during follow-up were identified and matched to up to 20 controls on year of birth, year of cohort entry, sex, and duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure was defined as ever use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, along with measures of duration and cumulative dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> associated with use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort included 115,727 new users of oral hypoglycaemic agents, with 470 patients diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> during follow-up (rate 89.4 per 100,000 person years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 376 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> that were diagnosed beyond one year of follow-up were matched to 6699 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, ever use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was associated with an increased rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> (rate ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 3.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate increased as a function of duration of use, with the highest rate observed in patients exposed for more than 24 months (1.99, 1.14 to 3.45) and in those with a cumulative dosage greater than 28,000 mg (2.54, 1.05 to 6.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> is associated with an increased risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
