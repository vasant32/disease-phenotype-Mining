<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether change in intraabdominal fat area (IAF) over time predicts subsequent development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We followed up 436 nondiabetic Japanese-American subjects (mean age 51.9 years, mean BMI 24.2 kg/m(2), 54% male) for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We fit a logistic regression model to examine the association over a 10-year follow-up between change in IAF at 5-year follow-up and other fat areas (measured by computed tomography) and development of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusted for age, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a first-degree relative, second-generation versus third-generation Japanese American (Nisei vs. Sansei), baseline IAF, BMI, weight change over time, smoking status, physical activity level, and subcutaneous fat (SCF) depot areas.RESULTS-Cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 20.4% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean change in IAF was 10.9 cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase of 1SD, in IAF was associated with a 1.65-fold increase in the odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 10 years (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.21-2.25) after adjusting for the above covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association was also independent of changes in thoracic, thigh, and abdominal SCF, as well as change in weight.CONCLUSIONS-We conclude that baseline IAF and accumulation of fat in this area over time are independent predictors of the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese Americans </plain></SENT>
