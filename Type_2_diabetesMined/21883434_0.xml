<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Assessment of risk factor control 3 years after diagnosis in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with no previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> included from the Swedish National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Register; a total of 19,382 patients (mean age 58 years) in cross-sectional surveys from 2003 to 2008, and a subgroup of 4293 patients followed individually from year of diagnosis to follow-up after a mean 2.6 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study risk engine, and modifiable 10-year risk defined as percentage excess risk above patients with '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' risk factor values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment goals for HbA1c , blood pressure, total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were achieved in 78.4, 65.5, 55.6% and 61.0%, respectively, in the cross-sectional survey in 2008, following a trend of generally improved control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the individually followed patients in the subgroup, mean absolute 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk increased from 13.7% (men/women 16.9/9.5%) to 14.2 (men/women 17.6/9.6%) (P &lt; 0.001) from year of diagnosis to follow-up after 2.6 years, while mean modifiable risk decreased from 37.7% (men/women 28.6/49.9%) to 19.1% (13.2/26.9%) (P &lt; 0.001 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high achievement of treatment goals and a low mean modifiable 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk was found at the 3-year follow-up, both in the cross-sectional survey in 2008 and in patients individually followed since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
