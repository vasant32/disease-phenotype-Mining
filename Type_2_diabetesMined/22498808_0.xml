<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because PPAR-Î³ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> modulate insulin sensitivity and are used to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we investigated whether circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26092">phthalate</z:chebi> metabolites are related to prevalent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,016 subjects, aged 70 years, were investigated in the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26092">phthalate</z:chebi> metabolites were detected in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participant sera by an API 4000 liquid chromatograph/tandem mass spectrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as the use of pharmacological <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> or a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;7.0 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 114 subjects were shown to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following adjustment for sex, BMI, serum cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, educational level, and smoking and exercise habits, high levels of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26092">phthalate</z:chebi> metabolites monomethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26092">phthalate</z:chebi> (MMP) (P &lt; 0.01), monoisobutyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26092">phthalate</z:chebi> (MiBP) (P &lt; 0.05), and monoethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26092">phthalate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>) (P &lt; 0.05), but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17243">mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate</z:chebi>, were associated with an increased prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the fasting proinsulin-to-insulin ratio as a marker of insulin secretion and the homeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, MiBP was mainly related to poor insulin secretion, whereas <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and MMP mainly were related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this cross-sectional study showed that several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26092">phthalate</z:chebi> metabolites are related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence, as well as to markers of insulin secretion and resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the view that these commonly used chemicals might influence major factors that are regulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in humans at the level of exposure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26092">phthalate</z:chebi> metabolites seen in the general elderly population </plain></SENT>
