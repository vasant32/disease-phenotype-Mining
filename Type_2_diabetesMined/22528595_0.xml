<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic CHD in these patients is elusive and carries a poor prognosis given the fact that an unheralded <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> frequently constitutes its first presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because effective screening for asymptomatic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for both the presence and severity of CHD is intuitively appealing, we have summarized the utility and prognostic value of various diagnostic modalities (both functionally and anatomically) in enhancing risk stratification and leading to improved and more aggressive management of the risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There exist some evidence and recommendations for screening of asymptomatic persons with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using certain modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More research is needed to define potential subsets of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who may benefit from additional testing for asymptomatic CHD </plain></SENT>
