<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e>, a diagnosis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> is often considered, but population-based data on the epidemiology of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to estimate the frequency of and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> among community subjects with DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this population-based, historical cohort study, the medical records linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project was used to identify 227 Olmsted County, MN residents with type 1 DM in 1995, a random sample of 360 residents with type 2 DM, and an age- and sex-stratified random sample of 639 nondiabetic residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using defined diagnostic criteria, we estimated the subsequent risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> in each group through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk in DM, compared with frequency-matched community controls, was assessed by Cox proportional hazards modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative proportions developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> over a 10-year time period were 5.2% in type 1 DM, 1.0% in type 2 DM, and 0.2% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> (relative to controls) was 33 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0, 274) in type 1 DM and 7.5 (95% CI: 0.8, 68) in type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> in type 1 DM was significantly greater than in type 2 DM (HR: 4.4 (1.1, 17)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heartburn (HR: 6.6 (1.7, 25)) at baseline was associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> in type 1 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>Gastroparesis</z:hpo> is relatively uncommon in patients with DM, although an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> was observed in type 1 DM </plain></SENT>
