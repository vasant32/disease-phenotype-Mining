<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A5 gene (APOA5) have been associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005317'>increased triglyceride levels</z:mp> in many different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify the frequencies of the APOA5 -1131T&gt;C and SW19 polymorphisms and evaluate their effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of APOA5 -1131T&gt;C and SW19 polymorphisms was performed by PCR-RFLP in 146 diabetic patients and in controls (n = 173), from 30 to 80 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients were divided into two groups: patients not treated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering drugs (group G1; n = 62) and those treated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering drugs (group G2, n = 84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were determined enzymatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among participants not treated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs (diabetics G1 and controls; n = 235), the -1131C was associated with lower LDLc levels (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic patients, the 19W allele was associated with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In G1 diabetic patients, the combined analysis of APOA5 -1131T&gt;C and SW19 polymorphisms showed that [TC or CC] + SS carriers presented lower total cholesterol levels than did other genotype combinations (p = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It could therefore be concluded that APOA5 -1131T&gt;C and SW19 polymorphisms influence <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
