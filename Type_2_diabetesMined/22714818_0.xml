<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report baseline data and factors associated with the injectable treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and healthcare resource-use data were collected at initiation of injectable therapy and analyzed using univariate tests between cohorts and multivariate logistic regression analysis for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 1,177 patients initiated exenatide twice daily (b.i.d.) and 1,315 initiated insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients were recruited by secondary-care physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses revealed statistically significant differences between the characteristics of patients who initiated exenatide b.i.d. and patients who initiated insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, higher body mass index [BMI; 5 kg/m(2) higher: odds ratio (OR) 2.10, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.84-2.40], lower glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c); 1% higher: OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.86), and lower age (5 years older: OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.88) were the variables most strongly associated with increased probability of receiving exenatide b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients initiating exenatide b.i.d. had a mean BMI of 35.3 ± 6.5 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) of 8.4 ± 1.4%, and age of 58 ± 10 years, compared with 29.7 ± 5.4 kg/m(2), 9.2 ± 1.9%, and 64 ± 11 years, respectively, in patients initiating insulin (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other characteristics significantly associated with exenatide b.i.d. initiation were "disinhibited eating" (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Health Profile-18), lower random blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, less blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring, lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and receipt of diet/exercise advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who initiated exenatide b.i.d. were on average younger and more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with lower HbA(1c) than those initiating insulin </plain></SENT>
