<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) facilitates the production of transgenic dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we generated transgenic dogs expressing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene, which is closely involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we assessed the cloning efficiency associated with adult or fetal (cloned or natural mating) fibroblasts as a nuclear source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cloning efficiency was determined by the fusion, pregnancy and cloning rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fusion rates were significantly high for fibroblasts from cloned fetuses, but the pregnancy and cloning rates were relatively high for cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, fetal fibroblasts were selected as the nuclear donor for SCNT and genetically engineered to overexpress the PEPCK gene and dual selection marker genes controlled by the PEPCK promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transgenic cells were introduced into oocytes and transferred into five recipient dogs, resulting in two pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, three puppies were born and confirmed by microsatellite analysis to be genetically identical to the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One puppy successfully overexpressed PEPCK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">canine disease</z:e> model may be useful for studying the pathogenesis and/or therapeutic targets of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
