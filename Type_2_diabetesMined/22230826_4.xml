<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> commonly accompanies <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, resulting in reduced adherence to medications and increased risk for morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine whether a simple, brief integrated approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) treatment improved adherence to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> and antidepressant medications, glycemic control, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> among primary care patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a randomized controlled trial conducted from April 2010 through April 2011 of 180 patients prescribed pharmacotherapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Integrated care managers collaborated with physicians to offer education and guideline-based treatment recommendations and to monitor adherence and clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence was assessed using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) assays to measure glycemic control and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intervention and usual care groups did not differ statistically on baseline measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who received the intervention were more likely to achieve HbA(1c) levels of less than 7% (intervention 60.9% vs. usual care 35.7%; P &lt; .001) and remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PHQ-9 score of less than 5: intervention 58.7% vs. usual care 30.7%; P &lt; .001) in comparison with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A randomized controlled trial of a simple, brief intervention integrating treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was successful in improving outcomes in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An integrated approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment may facilitate its deployment in real-world practices with competing demands for limited resources </plain></SENT>
