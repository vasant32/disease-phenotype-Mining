<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of glucagonlike peptidase-1 (GLP-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors on serum amylase and serum lipase levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 90 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treatment was initiated with a GLP-1 agonist or a DPP-4 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison group consisted of 33 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and similar characteristics who were not prescribed these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum amylase and lipase levels were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and repeated periodically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined the percentage of patients with elevated levels of serum amylase or lipase (or both) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 90 patients who received a GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> or a DPP-4 inhibitor, 32 (36%) had an increase in serum amylase or lipase (or both) in comparison with 6 of 33 patients (18%) with such increases in the comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the serum lipase levels increased more than the serum amylase values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To ascertain that this was not a chance laboratory error, serum samples were submitted to a second independent laboratory, and the same results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Usually, use of the medication was discontinued when serum lipase or amylase values were found to be elevated at any level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with increased levels of serum lipase more than serum amylase in many patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, possibly suggesting the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001869'>pancreatic inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether this finding may potentially lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo>, as reported in rat models, is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Careful observation of patients taking these medications may be prudent </plain></SENT>
