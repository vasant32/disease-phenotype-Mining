<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that common variants in the genes encoding adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and its receptors (ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2) would associate with circulating adiponectin concentrations and/or with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods  Seventy-seven tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ (24), ADIPOR1 (22) and ADIPOR2 (31) were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations of SNPs with baseline adiponectin concentrations were evaluated using linear modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations of SNPs with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results  Thirteen of 24 ADIPOQ SNPs were significantly associated with baseline adiponectin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis including these 13 SNPs revealed strong independent contributions from rs17366568, rs1648707, rs17373414 and rs1403696 with adiponectin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no ADIPOQ SNPs were directly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two ADIPOR1 SNPs (rs1342387 and rs12733285) were associated with ∼18% increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence for carriers of the minor allele without differences across treatment groups, and without any relationship with adiponectin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions  ADIPOQ SNPs are significantly associated with adiponectin concentrations in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This observation extends prior observations from unselected populations of European descent into a broader multi-ethnic population, and confirms the relevance of these variants in an <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>/dysglycaemic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the robust relationship between adiponectin concentrations and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in this cohort, variants in ADIPOQ that relate to adiponectin concentrations do not relate to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ADIPOR1 variants exerted significant effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk distinct from any effect of adiponectin concentrations. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
