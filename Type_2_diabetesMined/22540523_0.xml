<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Method:  97 elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed this randomized controlled educational trial study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided to intervention and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BASNEF (Belief, Attitude, Subjective Norm, Enabling Factors) educational model was used to design the educational intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control group received usual care during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric data, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles and blood pressure measurements were collected at baseline and week 12 in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results:  The intervention group showed a significant decline in body weight (-1.3±1.06 vs. 0.11±0.58 kg), body mass index (-0.48±0.37 vs. 0.05± 0.22 kg/m(2) ) and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (18.25±32.15 vs. -3.67±22.61 mg/dl) compared to the control diet (P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Waist to hip ratio reduced significantly in the intervention group (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant decline in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High- density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>) (-1.02±4.35 vs. -1.10±6.93 mg/dl, P = 0.9) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">Low- density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL- cholesterol</z:chebi>) (-4.04±11.64 vs. -1.08±4.35 mg/dl, P =0.2) in the intervention group compared to the control one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  Short-term nutrition education based on BASNEF educational model can improve serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level and anthropometric indices of elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant findings of the study:  Nutrition education based on BASNEF educational model could reduce body weight, body mass index, waist to hip ratio and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
