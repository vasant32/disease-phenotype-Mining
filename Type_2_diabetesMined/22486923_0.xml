<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the overall mortality risk of the individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in a large cohort of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an academic health centre enterprise-wide electronic health record (EHR) system to identify 23 915 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who initiated monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (N = 12774), glipizide (N = 4325), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (N = 4279) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (N = 2537), â‰¥ 18 years of age, with and without a history of CAD, and not on insulin or a non-insulin injectable at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for mortality by documentation in the EHR and Social Security <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox models with propensity analysis were used to compare cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in overall mortality risk was observed in the entire cohort with glipizide (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.39-1.94), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.35-1.88), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.37-2.06) versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; however, in those patients with documented CAD, a statistically significant increase in overall mortality risk was only found with glipizide (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.07-1.87) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.83) versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glipizide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> are associated with an increased risk of overall mortality versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that if a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> is required to obtain glycaemic control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> may be the preferred <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> in those with underlying CAD </plain></SENT>
