<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The increasing prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a pressing issue in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and self-reported participation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education among diabetic patients in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1405 respondents older than 19 years and having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between these variables was assessed using logistic regression after adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors observed that duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with having never attended <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education programs (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval = 0.93-0.96; P &lt; .001), with the greatest risk of not attending seen in recently diagnosed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, having lower educational attainment and living in non-Metro Seoul regions were independent factors for never attending <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education programs among diabetic patients in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests the need for developing effective education programs to encourage diabetic patients, particularly recently diagnosed patients, to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such programs could help deliver appropriate information for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients in Korea </plain></SENT>
