<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: South Asian migrants are at particularly high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that intensive lifestyle interventions may prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such interventions have not been culturally adapted and evaluated among South Asians in industrialized countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have set up a randomized controlled trial to study the effectiveness of a targeted lifestyle intervention for the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> among 18 to 60-year-old Hindustani Surinamese (South Asians) in The Hague, the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we present the study design and describe the characteristics of those recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May 18, 2009 and October 11, 2010, we screened 2307 Hindustani Surinamese (18-60 years old) living in The Hague </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We sent invitations to participate to those who had an impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 5.6-6.9 mmol/l, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> of 7.8-11.0 mmol/L, a glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of 6.0% or more and/or a value of 2.39 or more for the homeostasis model assessment of estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, 536 people (56.1% of those eligible) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>People with a higher level of education and a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more likely to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The control and intervention groups were similar with regard to important background characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intervention group will receive a culturally targeted intervention consisting of dietary counseling using motivational interviewing and a supervised physical activity program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The control group will receive generic lifestyle advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To determine the effectiveness, a physical examination (anthropometrics, cardiorespiratory test, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and measures of oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and insulin) and interview (physical activity, diet, quality of life, and intermediate outcomes) were carried out at baseline and will be repeated at 1 year and 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The process and the costs will be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This trial will provide insight into the feasibility and effectiveness of a targeted, intensive, lifestyle intervention for the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> among 18 to 60-year-old South Asians </plain></SENT>
