<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate associations between office and ambulatory blood pressures (BPs) and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications and to establish optimal threshold ambulatory BP values regarding the likehood of having microvascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, clinical, laboratory, and 24-h ABPM data were obtained in 550 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression assessed the associations between office and ambulatory BPs and diabetic micro and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optimal threshold values for ambulatory BPs (daytime, night-time, and 24 h) were established by examining the best combination of systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) that maximized the odds ratios (ORs) of having each microvascular complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential confounders, ambulatory SBPs were more strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> than office BPs, except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, in which both were equivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, night-time BPs were stronger correlates than daytime BPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal threshold ambulatory BP values were 125/75 mm Hg for daytime, 110/65 mm Hg for night-time, and 120/75 mm Hg for the 24-h period, with odds ranging from 1.7- to 2.3-fold of having each microvascular complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, ambulatory BPs are better correlates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications than office BPs in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association of microvascular complications with lower ambulatory BP levels than those reported as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for nondiabetic patients may indicate that lower cut-off values for ambulatory BPs might be considered in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
