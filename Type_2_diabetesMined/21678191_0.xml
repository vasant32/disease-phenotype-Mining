<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Self-management is central to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care and includes taking regular exercise, low-fat/sugar diet and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is understood about how people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> make sense of self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim, therefore, is to explore the process of 'getting one's thoughts straight' in relation to illness self-management for women with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight women were recruited from two hospitals in the North of England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each was interviewed using a biographic-narrative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Narratives were analysed using a dialogical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We use Bakhtin's concepts of voice, official and unofficial truth, and internally persuasive discourse to explore how participants considered, struggled with, and, sometimes, acted upon self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate how the truth by which participants lived shifted as they encountered new perspectives and experiences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accounts revealed tension between official, authoritative voices, typically concerned with optimal illness control and unofficial voices that speak at a lived, embodied level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we suggest moving beyond the notion of self-management towards a conceptualisation of life with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illness that includes personal goals, values and embodied experience in context </plain></SENT>
