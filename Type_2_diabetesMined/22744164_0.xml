<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is disproportionately high among Asian Indians (AI), one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the United States (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with inadequate self-management increases complications and thus medical costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acculturation may be an important determinant of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management and hence control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined the association between the degree of acculturation and glycemic control as measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c in AI adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mixed method (quantitative and qualitative) study was conducted among 30 AI adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acculturation assessment using the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-identity Instrument was followed by socio-demographic questions, self-reported anthropometric measures, and open ended <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A two-step multiple regression analysis and content analysis of verbatim interview transcriptions were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interactions of acculturation with body mass index (interaction b = 1.11; p = 0.01), annual household income (interaction b = 7.19; p = .01), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (interaction b = .30; p = .02) significantly predicted higher HbA1c levels (R(2) change = .368; F change = 4.21; p = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the qualitative interviews, the following were regarded as US specific facilitators for glycemic control: excellent health care system and facilities, availability of healthy food choices and self-monitoring devices, medical insurance benefits, good quality medications, and improved health awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cultural orientation might be important for patient tailored interventions targeting AI with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, interventions targeted at Asian Indians with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should include culture specific adaptations to nutrition education and support </plain></SENT>
