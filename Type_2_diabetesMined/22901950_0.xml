<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent Findings: The use of new insulin analogs and oral agents, as well as new technologies to deliver insulin and monitor <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during pregnancy remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review will outline the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the safety profiles of these new medications and therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary: There are many effective treatments for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New insulin analogs seem to be safe to use in pregnancy and offer the potential for better glycemic control compared with older agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oral hypoglycemic medications also seem to be safe and may be an option for a select group of pregnant patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin pumps and continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring systems may be beneficial in certain patients, but adequate data are not yet available in terms of outcomes and cost-effectiveness to support widespread use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Target Audience: Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After participating in this CME activity, physicians should be better able to revise glycemic goals for pregnant patients with pregestational <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to be in line with our current understanding of glycemic profiles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use new insulin analogs to treat pregnant women with abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and choose which patients will benefit from advanced technologies for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management, such as insulin pumps and continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring systems </plain></SENT>
