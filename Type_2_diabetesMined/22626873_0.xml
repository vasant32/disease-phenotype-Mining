<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c variability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study in type 2 diabetic patients followed for at least 2 years between 2003 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A1C variability was determined from the standard deviation or coefficient of variation of serial A1C values (A1C(SD) or A1C(CV)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized into either the high or low A1C variability group according to their A1C(CV) median </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) of various factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were determined from Cox's proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 881 subjects (422 men, 459 women) were included and 73 (8.3%) died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was 4.7 Â± 2.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality was higher in subjects with high A1C(CV) (11.0% vs. 5.4%, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the Kaplan-Meier failure curve, subjects with higher A1C(CV) demonstrated a trend of higher mortality (p=0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox's proportional hazards models, A1C(SD) and A1C(CV) significantly predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality with an HR of 1.987 (p=0.02) and 1.062 (p=0.013), respectively, after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, mean systolic blood pressure, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, smoking status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e>, and mean A1C values (A1C(MEAN)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ability of A1C(SD) and A1C(CV) to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was more evident in subjects with relatively low A1C(MEAN.) CONCLUSIONS: A1C variability is an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
