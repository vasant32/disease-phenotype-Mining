<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on urinary 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) excretion in type 2 diabetics and explore its possible reno-protective mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-eight uncontrolled type 2 diabetics were assigned randomly into group DP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> add-on) and group DS (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> add-on) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the basal and after 12 weeks treatment, FBG, HbA1c, urinary 8-OHdG, urinary albumin(ALB) and urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (Cr) were determined, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with pre-treatment, FBG, HbA1c and urinary 8-OHdG /Cr ratio(U8CR) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> obviously decreased in both therapy groups; urinary albumin/urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio(UACR) markedly decreased in group DP (P&lt;0.01), while slightly decreased in group DS (P&gt;0.05) after twelve weeks of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12-week treatment, UACR and U8CR in group DP were significantly lower than those in group DS (both P&lt;0.05) without no marked difference in FBG and HbA1c between group DP and group DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, U8CR had positive correlation with UACR (r=0.755, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> can decrease urinary 8-OHdG excretion and lighten <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in vivo in type 2 diabetics, which may play a protective role for the kidney damage </plain></SENT>
