<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 98 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (aged 59±9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Both time (standard deviation of RR intervals, root-mean-square of successive RR interval differences) and frequency (total spectral power, high frequency, low frequency, very low frequency) domains of heart rate variability were analysed in a 5min recording at rest and 20min after a maximal treadmill test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise was identified by peak blood pressure ≥190/105mmHg (women) or ≥210/105mmHg (men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each group of either exaggerated exercise blood pressure response or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure response consisted of 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At rest there were no significant differences between groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time and frequency domain parameters of heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-exercise, there was a significant (p&lt;0.05) reduction in the SDNN, RMSSD and TP in the exaggerated exercise blood pressure group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent correlates (p&lt;0.01) of exercise systolic blood pressure included post-exercise TP, resting systolic blood pressure, cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> and beta-blockers (beta=-0.28, adj </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>R(2)=0.32, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced post-exercise heart rate variability in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, with an exaggerated exercise blood pressure response suggests preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> characterized by impaired vagal modulation </plain></SENT>
