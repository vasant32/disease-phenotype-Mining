<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven Japanese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean BMI 23.3 kg/m(2) ) were followed for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level every 1-2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using the slope of regression line between fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level and duration, we calculated its individual annual decline as an index of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up periods of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, the patients were evaluated for fasting serum non-esterified fatty acid, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) levels for the last 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> or anti-insulin antibodies from among the insulin-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Association between the individual annual decline of fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level and related factors were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean individual annual decline of fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level was -0.013 Â± 0.027 nmol/l/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum non-esterified fatty acid level had no significant difference between the first and the last 2 years of the 8-year observation period of non-esterified fatty acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using multiple regression analysis, mean fasting serum non-esterified fatty acid level was associated with the individual annual decline of fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level (standardized regression coefficient -0.358, P=0.0056), although other related factors, including HbA(1c) level, were not associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mean fasting serum non-esterified fatty acid level during an 8-year observation was independently associated with long-term progressive deterioration of insulin secretion in Japanese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
