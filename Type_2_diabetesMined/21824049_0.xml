<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increased telomere shortening has been demonstrated in several diseases including type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether telomere length changes during the course of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine telomere length at different stages of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including early and late stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 93 males with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 10 years or more since original diagnosis; 96 males with less than one year of diagnosis; 98 age matched healthy males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was estimated by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting venous blood samples were obtained for measurement of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a greater telomere shortening in group (A) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 10 years or more since original diagnosis, compared with the control group (C) of healthy males (5.4 vs 9.6 Kb) (p = 0.04) and with group B (5.4 vs 8.7 kb) (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to inflammatory markers TNF-Î±, malondialdehyde peroxidation and adiponectin we found significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Telomere shortening increases with the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time of exhibition suggests in parallel that the progressive increase of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> plays a direct role in telomere shortening </plain></SENT>
