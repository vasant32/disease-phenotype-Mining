<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mean layer thickness was calculated for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers following automated segmentation of spectral domain optical coherence tomography images of diabetic patients with no or minimal DR and compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the relationship between layer thickness and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, DR status, age, sex, and HbA1c, a multiple linear regression analysis was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the pericentral area of the macula, the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL) were thinner in patients with minimal DR compared to controls (respective difference 1.9 μm, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-3.5 μm; 5.2 μm, 95% CI 1.0-9.3 μm; 4.5 μm, 95% CI 2.2-6.7 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral area of the macula, the RNFL and IPL were thinner in patients with minimal DR compared to controls (respective difference 3.2 μm, 95% CI 0.1-6.4 μm; 3.3 μm, 95% CI 1.2-5.4 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis showed DR status to be the only significant explanatory variable (R = 0.31, P = 0.03) for this <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thinning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated thinner inner <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers in the macula of type 2 diabetic patients with minimal DR than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support the concept that early DR includes a neurodegenerative component </plain></SENT>
