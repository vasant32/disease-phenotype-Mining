<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As neoangiogenesis is impaired in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, the aim of this study is to evaluate the neovessel formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tendinopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients aged more than 55 years were selected, and divided into two groups: a) type 2 diabetic patients, and b) non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both groups, those with ultrasound features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tendinopathy</z:e> were included, and intratendinous vascularisation was estimated by means of Power Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tendinopathy</z:e> were observed in 104 diabetic subjects and in 221 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neovascularisation, with higher Power Doppler scores, was found more frequently in controls, while lower Power Doppler scores were prevalent in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, tendinopathic features are significantly higher than healthy controls, while the prevalence of neovascularization inside tendons is less represented </plain></SENT>
