<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the effect of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and meals rich in saturated fat and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> on PON1 activity in chylomicrons and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PON1 arylesterase activity was measured in chylomicrons and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> that were isolated in serum from 20 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20 age- and gender-matched, overweight controls 3 h after meals rich in cream or olive oil in a randomized, cross-over study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chylomicron-PON1 activity (45%, P = 0.02), ratio chylomicron-PON1/chylomicron-triacylglycerides (TAG) (42%, P = 0.03) and chylomicron-protein content (46%, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with controls after the olive oil meal with comparable findings after the meal rich in cream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After ingestion of olive oil, chylomicron-PON1 activity was significantly higher in controls (P = 0.01) and marginally higher (P = 0.06) in diabetic patients and chylomicron-TAG were significantly (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>05) higher in both groups of subjects, compared with values after ingestion of cream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-PON1 increased (two-fold) significantly (P &lt; 0.003) during both meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chylomicron-PON1 activity was correlated significantly with chylomicron-protein (P &lt; 0.001, n = 40) and with postprandial serum PON1 activity (P ≤ 0.001, n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with abnormally low chylomicron-PON1 activity after fatty meals and this may be linked to lower chylomicron-protein content and serum PON1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Switching from saturated fat to olive oil in the meal increases PON1 activity in the chylomicron fraction largely due to increased numbers of chylomicron particles </plain></SENT>
