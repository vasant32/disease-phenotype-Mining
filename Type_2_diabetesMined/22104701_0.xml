<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A slightly increased risk in men was found in the north-east and western part of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The higher risk areas in women were found in the western coastal area and in eastern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present register-based study aimed to evaluate the regional association of the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among young adults with the concentration of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> in local ground water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association was evaluated using Bayesian modeling of geo-referenced data aggregated into a regular 10 km Ã— 10 km grid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No marked association was found, although suggestive findings were detected for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> in well water and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young adult women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this register-based study did not completely rule out the association of well water <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> with the geographical variation of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was much higher among individuals aged 40 or over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These suggestive findings indicate that the association between <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> would also be worth examining among individuals over 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
