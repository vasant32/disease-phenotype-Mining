<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 528 adults (30-80 years) with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who were participants in a diet and physical activity intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Waist circumference (WC), fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, HOMA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and physical activity (accelerometer) were measured at baseline and at 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear regression models were used to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of accelerometer-derived sedentary time and breaks in sedentary time (BST) with metabolic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses each hour of sedentary time was associated with larger WC (unstandardised regression coefficient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30166">[B]</z:chebi> [95% CI] 1.89 cm [0.94, 2.83]; p &lt; 0.001), higher insulin (B = 8.22 pmol/l [2.80, 13.65]; p = 0.003) and HOMA-IR (B = 0.42 [0.14, 0.70]; p = 0.004), and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (B = -0.04 mmol/l [-0.06, -0.01]; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for WC attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each BST was associated with lower WC (B = -0.15 cm [- 0.24, -0.05]; p = 0.003) and there was evidence of a weak linear association with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, but no association with insulin levels or HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Volume of sedentary time at baseline predicted <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (B = -0.05 mmol/l [-0.08, -0.01]; p = 0.007), insulin levels (B = 8.14 pmol/l [0.1.51, 14.78]; p = 0.016) and HOMA-IR (B = 0.49 [0.08, 0.90]; p = 0.020) at 6 months, though not WC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline BST did not substantially predict any metabolic variables at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No change was seen in sedentary time or BST between baseline and 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Higher sedentary time is associated with a poorer metabolic profile in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
