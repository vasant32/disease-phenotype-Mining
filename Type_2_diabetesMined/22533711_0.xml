<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore whether there is an association of ABCC8 polymorphisms SUR1 exon 16 (-3C/T), SUR-1 exon 31 (Arg1273Arg), and SUR-1 exon 33 (S1369A) with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentration and BMI in type 2 diabetics on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: This study included 251 unrelated type 2 diabetics on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Polymorphic allele carriers of the SUR-1 exon 16 (-3C/T) polymorphism were more frequent in the subgroup of patients with the TG concentration increase after 6 months (p for genotype and allelic differences: 0.024 and 0.015, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: ABCC8 polymorphisms in exon 16 and 31 are associated with the TG concentration in type 2 diabetics on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
