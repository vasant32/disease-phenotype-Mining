<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The α-glucosidase inhibitor (α-GI) miglitol is useful for controlling the early postprandial increase of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but the combined effect of miglitol and multiple daily insulin injections (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>) on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we retrospectively compared the daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile, evaluated by self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) at nine times on the day before discharge from hospital, between type 2 diabetic patients receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> (n=81) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> plus miglitol at 150 mg daily (n=24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, we prospectively examined the effect of adding miglitol to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> on the daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile (SMBG) in 19 other type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the daily insulin dosage and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level before meals did not differ between the two groups, the 1-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level after each meal, 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level after lunch and dinner, mean and standard deviation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and amplitude of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion were significantly lower or smaller in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> plus miglitol group than in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> parameters were significantly improved by adding miglitol to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> in the prospective cohort of 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, adding miglitol to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> reduces postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and attenuates daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuation in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
