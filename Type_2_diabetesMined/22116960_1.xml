<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 2245G/A gene polymorphism of the RAGE gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in Malaysian type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 342 unrelated type 2 diabetic patients (171 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR), 171 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DNR)) and 235 unrelated healthy subjects from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over Malaysia were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from 3 ml samples of whole blood using a modified conventional DNA extraction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotype and allele frequencies of 2245G/A were studied using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in 2245A minor allele frequency was found between control (5.5%) and DR groups (15.2%) (p&lt;0.001, OR=3.06, 95% CI 1.87 to 5.02) as well as between DNR (8.2%) and DR (15.2%) groups (p&lt;0.01, OR=2.01, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when the frequency was compared between control and DNR groups, there was no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that shows an association between the 2245A allele of the RAGE gene and development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in the Malaysian population </plain></SENT>
