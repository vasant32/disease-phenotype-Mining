<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> has grown to staggering numbers, and its incidence is expected to rise in the next 2 decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The need for novel approaches to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> cannot be ignored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current agents have been shown to modestly improve glycemia and in some cases prevent complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but they become less effective over time and are often accompanied by undesirable adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin is the lead agent in a new class of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents known as <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which represent a novel approach to the management of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By selectively and reversibly blocking the SGLT2 receptor, dapagliflozin prevents the reabsorption of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at the renal proximal tubule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase II and III clinical trials have demonstrated that dapagliflozin is a safe and effective method for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin produces a sustained, dose-dependent reduction in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels while simultaneously improving insulin secretion and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 12-24 weeks, reductions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) ranged from 0.54-0.89% when dapagliflozin was administered once/day (either as monotherapy or add-on therapy to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs with or without insulin) to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapy with dapagliflozin also results in a mild <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50504">osmotic-diuretic</z:chebi> effect that may account for decreases in total body weight (~2-3 kg) and blood pressure (systolic 2-5 mm Hg, diastolic 1.5-3 mm Hg), and increases in hematocrit (1-2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin has a favorable safety profile, with the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> similar to those of placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> were more commonly reported in patients taking dapagliflozin (2-13%) than those taking placebo (0-8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin does not appear to cause electrolyte disturbances, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e>, or nephrotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results from clinical trials have been promising, and well-designed clinical programs that address the long-term safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin are under way </plain></SENT>
