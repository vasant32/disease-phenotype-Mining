<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether in utero programming and immunomodulation also affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we investigated the effects of immunization on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin responses in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor-deficient mice fed regular or 60% <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> diets, as well as in offspring fed 0.5% cholesterol or 60% <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IR was assessed by fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamps, pancreatic immunohistochemistry and plasma free fatty acid concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunizations improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responses in both genders and protected both immunized mice and their offspring against IR and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protection occurred even under euglycemic conditions, but was greatest in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> males exposed to very obesogenic/diabetogenic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps confirmed that maternal immunization protected mainly by reducing IR, but pancreatic immunocytochemistry also indicated some protection against beta cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maternal immunization was associated with marked regulation in offspring of 4 genes relevant to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 19 genes of importance for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, as well as increased hepatic activities of key <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings establish that targeted immunomodulation may be used to protect immunized subjects and their offspring against IR and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and thus to reduce cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also support the notion that in utero programming influences offspring disease not by a single mechanism, but by multiple systemic effects </plain></SENT>
