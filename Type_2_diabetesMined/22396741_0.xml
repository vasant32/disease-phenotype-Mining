<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The main objective was to evaluate the association between SNPs and haplotypes of the FABP1-4 genes and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as well as its interaction with fat intake, in one general Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association was replicated in a second population in which HOMA index was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1217 unrelated individuals were selected from a population-based study [Hortega study: 605 women; mean age 54 y; 7.8% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The replication population included 805 subjects from Segovia, a neighboring region of Spain (446 females; mean age 52 y; 10.3% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> mellitus was defined in a similar way in both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen SNPs previously associated with metabolic traits or with potential influence in the gene expression within the FABP1-4 genes were genotyped with SNPlex and tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, sex and BMI were used as covariates in the logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One polymorphism (rs2197076) and two haplotypes of the FABP-1 showed a strong association with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> in the original population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was further confirmed in the second population as well as in the pooled sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the other analyzed variants in FABP2, FABP3 and FABP4 genes were associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was not a formal interaction between rs2197076 and fat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant association between the rs2197076 and the haplotypes of the FABP1 and HOMA-IR was also present in the replication population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the role of common variants of the FABP-1 gene in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
