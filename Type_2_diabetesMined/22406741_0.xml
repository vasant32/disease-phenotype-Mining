<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Smaller size at birth is associated with a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in later life, but the mechanisms behind this association are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants which influence susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> via effects on insulin secretion or action are good candidates for association with birth weight because foetal insulin is a key foetal growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on recent progress in identifying associations between common genetic variants and birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Foetal genetic variants at two loci (near CCNL1 and in ADCY5) were robustly associated with birth weight via the foetal genotype in the first genome-wide association study of birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The birth weight-lowering allele at ADCY5 also predisposes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, evidence from studies of other type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci is accumulating for association between the foetal risk alleles at CDKAL1 and HHEX-IDE and lower birth weight, and the maternal risk alleles at GCK and TCF7L2 and higher birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The associations with birth weight at ADCY5, CDKAL1 and HHEX-IDE support the foetal insulin hypothesis, which proposed that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and lower birth weight could be two phenotypes of the same genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associations at GCK and TCF7L2 illustrate that maternal genes are also important determinants of birth weight </plain></SENT>
