<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These agents differ in structure, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> act by inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition increases levels of the incretin hormones glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, which in turn stimulate insulin secretion in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials have shown that DPP-4 inhibitors provide significant reductions in glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, with a low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animal model experiments and proof-of-concept studies suggest that the incretins favorably affect the cardiovascular system; it is possible that these same effects may be conveyed by DPP-4 inhibitor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled and meta-analyses of DPP-4 inhibitor clinical trial data have shown no increase in major adverse cardiovascular events, and, in fact, suggest a potential cardiovascular benefit to such therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term cardiovascular safety trials are currently underway to more fully define and understand the cardiovascular impact of DPP-4 therapy in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
