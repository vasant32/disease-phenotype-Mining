<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Available study in Nigerian-Africans is scare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy (30 males) and (40 females) type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, with age mean of 54 Â± 11.52 years were selected for this study and thirty apparently healthy volunteers were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biochemical parameters and anthropometric indices were determined using standard procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant increases were obtained in body weight, body mass index (p&lt;0.001) and waist circumference (p&lt;0.012) when compared with the corresponding control values respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.01), tHcy (p&lt;0.02), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.03) were significantly higher in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group when compared with the corresponding control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) (p&lt;0.05) were significantly reduced compared to the control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tHcy (p&lt;0.01) was significantly higher in the males when compared with the corresponding female value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant decrease was obtained in the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.003) in the male patients when compared with the female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our result showed increased plasma tHcy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and waist circumference as well as decreased <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These alterations are risk factors for premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events </plain></SENT>
