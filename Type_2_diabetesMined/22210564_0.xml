<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between 1,5-anhydroglucitol (AG) levels, which are a marker of glycemic control, and stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with 269 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were divided into four groups based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> (eGFR(MDRD)) formula: 57 in control, 111 in CKD stages 1-2, 78 in stage 3, and 23 in stages 4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study groups differed significantly with respect to 1,5-AG and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and percentage of antihypertension or antidyslipidemia medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multivariate regression analyses showed that 1,5-AG levels in the control group, the CKD stages 1-2 group, and the CKD stage 3 group could be explained by HbA(1c), age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, FPG, and antihypertension medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, eGFR(MDRD) was the only independent determinant of 1,5-AG levels in CKD stages 4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logarithmic transformed 1,5-AG values (ln[1,5-AG]) had significant inverse correlations with HbA(1c) and FPG levels for CKD stages 1-2 and CKD stage 3 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, associations between ln(1,5-AG) and HbA(1c) or FPG were insignificant for CKD stages 4-5 (P = 0.274 and P = 0.080, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 1,5-AG levels do not appear to be influenced by mild or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, suggesting it is a reliable glycemic marker in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with CKD stages 1-3 </plain></SENT>
