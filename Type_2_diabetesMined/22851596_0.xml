<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether prediction of this outcome, according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) staging by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>-based estimates of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcreat), is improved by further staging with serum cystatin C-based estimates (eGFRcyst).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSPatients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in CKD stages 1-3 were selected from three cohorts: two from Joslin <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Center, one with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (N = 364) and one with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (N = 402), and the third from the Finnish Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>Nephropathy</z:hpo> (FinnDiane) Study of type 1 (N = 399) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and cystatin C were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up averaged 8-10 years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> (n = 246) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> (n = 159) were ascertained.RESULTSAlthough CKD staging by eGFRcyst was concordant with that by eGFRcreat for 62% of Joslin patients and 73% of FinnDiane patients, those given a higher stage by eGFRcyst than eGFRcreat had a significantly higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> than those with concordant staging in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cohorts (hazard ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.8-3.1]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients at a lower stage by eGFRcyst than by eGFRcreat had a lower risk than those with concordant staging (0.30 [0.13-0.68]) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This conclusion can be generalized to patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to diabetic patients in the U.S. and Finland </plain></SENT>
