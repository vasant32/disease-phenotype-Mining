<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) predicts LVMI independent of central SBP in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined office, ambulatory, and central blood pressures and performed echocardiography in 460 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who participated in the CARDIPP (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular Risk factors</z:e> in Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> - a Prospective study in Primary care) study (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT 01049737) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In separate multivariable regression models, 24-h ambulatory SBP, ambulatory day time SBP, and ambulatory night-time SBP were significantly associated with LVMI, independent of central SBP, age, sex, BMI, ambulatory 24-h heart rate, known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the presence or absence of any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications (r=0.19, 0.17, and 0.18, respectively, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ambulatory SBP parameters, but not central SBP, were significantly associated with LVMI independent of office SBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ambulatory SBP predicted LVMI independent of central SBP in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of ambulatory blood pressure measurements may be encouraged as a tool for refined risk stratification of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
