<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated how liver fat content (LFC) influences cholesterol metabolism by quantifying liver fat using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by measuring the serum concentrations of lathosterol, a marker of cholesterol synthesis, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27693">sitosterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28623">campesterol</z:chebi>, two markers of cholesterol absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated whether this relationship could be modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted in 263 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 137 of whom (52.0%) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients (62.7%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> (LFC&gt;5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed specific analyses in patients without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy and in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the lathosterol to cholesterol ratio correlated positively with LFC, and in multivariate analysis, the lathosterol to cholesterol ratio was associated with LFC independently of age, gender and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27693">Sitosterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28623">campesterol</z:chebi> concentrations were not associated with LFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, LFC is associated with an increase in cholesterol synthesis that is independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
