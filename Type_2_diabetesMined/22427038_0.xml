<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other than known clinical risk factors, the influence of genes has been suggested as part of the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of Gly82Ser, 1704G/T and 2184A/G polymorphisms in the RAGE gene with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients in Malaysia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> patients and 185 unrelated healthy controls from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over Malaysia were recruited in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allele and genotype frequencies of the three gene polymorphisms were investigated using PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of the three polymorphisms did not differ significantly between the control and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the frequency of GA+AA, GT+TT and AG+GG in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> group did not reveal significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that RAGE gene Gly82Ser, 1704G/T and 2184A/G polymorphisms are not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> development in the Malaysian population </plain></SENT>
