<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were from a population-based sample of 1136 individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed with a single fasting whole blood/plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> â‰¥7.0/8.0mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median time from day of diagnosis until end of follow up was 18.8years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HbA(1c) and elevated HbA(1c) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of elevated HbA(1c) on a number of clinical outcomes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was assessed in Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At diagnosis, 97 patients (8.5%) had an HbA(1c) level within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age (mean (SD)) at diagnosis was 64.5 (11.5) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for the effect of HbA(1c) on mortality and other outcomes were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are diagnosed with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> by means of elevated fasting whole blood/plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> but have HbA(1c) within reference range at diagnosis do not seem to have a relatively benign long-term clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore new diagnostic procedures should preferably be able to identify these individuals </plain></SENT>
