<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The evidence on the association between fish consumption, dietary long-chain n-3 fatty acids, and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available prospective evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Studies were identified by searching the PubMed and EMBASE databases through 15 December 2011 and by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies were included if they reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% CIs for the association between fish consumption and/or dietary long-chain n-3 fatty acids and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A dose-response random-effects model was used to combine study-specific RRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> were explored by prespecified stratifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen studies involving 527,441 participants and 24,082 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considerable statistical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the overall summary estimates was partly explained by geographical differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For each serving per week increment in fish consumption, the RRs (95% CIs) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 1.05 (1.02-1.09), 1.03 (0.96-1.11), and 0.98 (0.97-1.00) combining U.S., European, and Asian/Australian studies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For each 0.30 g per day increment in long-chain n-3 fatty acids, the corresponding summary estimates were 1.17 (1.09-1.26), 0.98 (0.70-1.37), and 0.90 (0.82-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results from this meta-analysis indicate differences between geographical regions in observed associations of fish consumption and dietary intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In consideration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> results, the relationship warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, current public health recommendations on fish consumption should be upheld unchanged </plain></SENT>
