<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This work aimed to determine MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and nitration in term placentas from type 2 diabetic patients and verify the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrites</z:chebi> are positive regulators of placental MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, term placentas from healthy and type 2 diabetic patients were analyzed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and activities, protein nitration, and nitration of MMP-2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Villous explants were cultured in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrites</z:chebi> for further evaluation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were increased in term placentas from diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were found even when MMP-2 protein concentrations were diminished and MMP-9 protein concentrations were not changed in the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased protein nitration and specific nitration of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were found in term placentas from diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">Peroxynitrites</z:chebi> were able to increase the activity of placental MMP-2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this study has shown for first time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrites</z:chebi> can nitrate and activate MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the placenta, a nitrative pathway possibly related to MMPs overactivity in the placentas from type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
