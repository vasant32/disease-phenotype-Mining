<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a mutational screening in a 58-year-old woman presenting early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The entire coding regions of MC4R, MC3R, HNF1A, GCK and POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) genes were analyzed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new missense mutation was identified within the POMC gene signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence, resulting in a heterozygous substitution of an arginine for a glycine at codon 15 (p.A15G) that was excluded in 300 healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation segregated in the family and was associated with overweight, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> in the carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional studies demonstrated that POMC protein was not detectable in Î²-TC3 cells transfected with A15G-POMC vector as well as in their culture media, despite POMC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were comparable for amount and stability to those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In silico <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> folding prediction indicated that the mutation gives rise to a different <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> secondary structure, suggesting that it might affect translation and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report addressing the functional consequences of a mutation in the signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of POMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings further support the hypothesis that POMC-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> might have a role in the control of peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and suggest that disruption of central POMC secretion might represent an additional link between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 30 May 2012; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.103 </plain></SENT>
