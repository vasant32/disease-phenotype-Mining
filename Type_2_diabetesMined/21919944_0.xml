<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean ages were 36.5 ± 8.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group A (n = 20) with glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> &gt;10% and group B (n = 20) with glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single sample was examined according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Sperm-Cervical Mucus Interaction, 1999, Cambridge University Press) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> was assessed using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> concentration in semen of group A patients (0.95 ± 0.35 nmol ml(-1)) was significantly higher than in group B patients (0.43 ± 0.13 nmol ml(-1)) (P value &lt; 0.05) and had negative relationship with sperm density (r = -.717; P value &lt; 0.05), total sperm count (r = -.625; P value &lt; 0.05), progressive motility (r = -.489; P value &lt; 0.05) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> forms (r = -.545; P value &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, it could be concluded that increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with poor metabolic control was associated with low sperm quality </plain></SENT>
