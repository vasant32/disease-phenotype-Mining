<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Evidence has been presented recently that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients have an increased level of DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This DNA damage could be associated with oxidative, inflammatory, and endothelial biomarkers and could represent a possible indication of injury in the endothelium and induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To confirm this possible association, DNA strand breakage was evaluated by use of the comet assay and its association with oxidative, inflammatory, and endothelial biomarkers in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case-control study (30 healthy controls and 32 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) was performed to evaluate the association between DNA damage and NOx (nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>), interleukin-6 (IL-6), urinary albumin, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients presented higher DNA damage than control subjects, higher levels of IL-6 and urinary albumin, and lower NOx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations between DNA damage and NOx (r=-0.303, p=0.016), IL-6 (r=0.845, p&lt;0.001), urinary albumin (r=0.496, p&lt;0.001), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r=0.449, p&lt;0.001), and HbA(1c) (r=0.575, p&lt;0.001) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings showed an increase of DNA damage in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> especially in those patients with poor glycemic control and associations among NOx, IL-6 and urinary albumin levels with DNA damage </plain></SENT>
