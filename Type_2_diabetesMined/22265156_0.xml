<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate whether plasma pentosidine, a well-defined advanced glycation end product, is associated with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two eyes with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type 2 diabetic eyes were divided into 2 groups: 22 eyes (22 patients; mean age, 61 years) with nondiabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NDR) and 20 eyes (20 patients; mean age, 61 years) with mild nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NPDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> laser Doppler system to measure the arterial diameter, velocity, and blood flow in the major temporal <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pulsatility ratio, a resistive index expressed as the peak systolic to the end diastolic velocity ratio, was calculated from the blood velocity traces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma pentosidine was measured in 42 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a commercially available competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pulsatility ratio significantly increased in patients with NPDR (4.8 ± 1.5) compared with patients with NDR (3.7 ± 0.8) (P = .0061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in velocity, diameter, or blood flow were seen between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma pentosidine levels also increased significantly (P = .0085) in patients with NPDR (0.057 ± 0.015) compared to patients with NDR (0.047 ± 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pulsatility ratio was correlated positively with the plasma pentosidine levels in patients with NPDR (Pearson correlation, r = 0.45, P = .044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that the plasma pentosidine level was significantly associated with the pulsatility ratio (standardized coefficient, 0.62; P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries may increase with increasing plasma pentosidine in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
