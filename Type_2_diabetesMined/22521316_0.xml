<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate transcriptional repression activity of PAX4 R192H polymorphism on its target promoters comparing with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PAX4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> PAX4 and PAX4 R192H proteins were expressed in vitro and the cell compartmentalization of each protein was examined after transfection of the plasmid constructs into βTC3 cells followed by Western-blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasmid containing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PAX4 or PAX4 R192H was co-transfected into βTC3 and αTC-1.9 cells with insulin or glucagon promoter-reporter construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional repression activities were then determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> PAX4 and PAX4 R192H, which were found to be equally expressed in vitro and transfection systems, were present in the nuclear compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional repressor activities of PAX4 R192H on human insulin and glucagon promoters were reduced when they were compared with those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PAX4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that PAX4 R192H polymorphism generated a protein with defect in transcriptional repressor activities on its target genes, which may lead to β-cell dysfunction associated with MODY and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-age of T2D as reported in our previous study </plain></SENT>
