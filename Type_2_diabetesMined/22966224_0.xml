<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several types of treatment have been employed against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> some of which ameliorate NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequent line of treatment to improve insulin sensitivity is the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZD) which activate the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Pparγ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although TZDs are proven to be very effective in promoting insulin sensitivity, its actions on Pparγ have been complicated, specifically on NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to studies in different models, Pparγ manifests both beneficial and undesirable effects on NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This paper will focus on the current knowledge of Pparγ and its effect on NAFLD </plain></SENT>
