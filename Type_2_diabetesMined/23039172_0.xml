<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients have a decreased health-related quality of life compared to healthy persons, especially regarding physical functioning and well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life is even lower in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients when other diseases co-exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to earlier studies, we assessed the associations between the number and type of comorbidities and health status in well-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, in whom treatment goals for HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol had been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately one in five type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients belongs to this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was performed in 2086 well-controlled (HbA1c &lt;=58 mmol/mol, systolic blood pressure &lt;=145 mmHg, total cholesterol &lt;=5.2 mmol/l and not using insulin) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both number and type (cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular) of comorbidities were determined for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Health status was assessed with the questionnaires Short Form-36 (SF-36) and EuroQol (EQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SF-36 generates eight dimensions of health and a Physical and Mental Component Score (PCS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>), scale: 0--100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EQ consists of two parts: EQ-5D and EQ Visual Analogue Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess if number and type of comorbidities were associated with health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Well-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with comorbidities had a much lower health status, with a decrease ranging from -1.5 for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> to -26.3 for role limitations due to physical problems, compared to those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Health status decreased when the number of comorbidities increased, except for mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> and both EQ measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidity, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems and PCS were significantly lower than in patients with only cardiovascular comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Physical functioning was also lower compared to patients with only non-cardiovascular comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even acceptable values of HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients are not necessarily related with a good health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We have shown that comorbidities have a large impact on health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Physicians may take into account patient's health status and integrate the impact of comorbidities into <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
