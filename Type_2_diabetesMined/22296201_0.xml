<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The present study aimed to examine known gene polymorphisms within IL-12B (+1188) region and its circulating serum levels in Type 2 diabetic patients from the southeastern region of Iran and compare them with unrelated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: In this clinical study, peripheral blood was collected from 114 Type 2 diabetic patients and 100 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-12B were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and polymorphisms at the +1188 position of the IL-12B gene were assessed using PCR restriction fragment-length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that the AA genotype and the A allele of IL-12B were increased significantly in Type 2 diabetic patients when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results also showed that the circulating levels of IL-12B were significantly decreased in Type 2 diabetic patients when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to the findings of the current study, we concluded that IL-12B and its +1188 polymorphism may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further replicative investigations using a larger sample size are essential to identify additional IL-12B genetic variants associated with a risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
