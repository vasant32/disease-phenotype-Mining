<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC) is a chemical modification of proteins produced by reaction of fumarate with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">thiol groups</z:chebi> in protein, a process known as succination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose to use the name S-(2-succino)cysteine (instead of S-(2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26810,37952">succinyl</z:chebi>)cysteine) from this point on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is to distinguish protein succination (in which fumarate forms a thioether linkage with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi>) from succinylation (in which an <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51277">thioester</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> bond would be formed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Succination of proteins is increased in muscle of type 1 diabetic rats and in adipose tissue in type 2 diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in 2SC is a direct result of tissue accumulation of fumarate in response to nutrient excess and resultant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> stress in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the breadth of succination of tissue proteins in the db/db type 2 model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also determined the extent of succination in epididymal adipocytes of type 1 (Akita, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)) and type 2 (ob/ob, db/db) diabetic mice, in diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (DIO) mice, and in the adipose tissue of ground squirrels in various stages of hibernation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While succination was not increased in most tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle) in the db/db model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, it was increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adipose beds of type 2 diabetic and DIO mice in comparison to their controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Succination was not increased in adipocytes of type 1 diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue from hibernating (HIB) 13-lined ground squirrels was also studied to determine if <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> affected succination of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in succination of proteins in brown or white adipose tissue over the <z:mp ids='MP_0005202'>torpor</z:mp>-arousal cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 2SC is a biomarker of nutrient excess and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> stress in adipose tissue, increasing under the hyperglycemic and insulin resistant conditions associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
