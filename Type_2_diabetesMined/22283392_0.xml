<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared clinical measures, prescribed medication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and self-rated health in individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a screened vs. an unscreened population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A parallel-group, cohort study of people aged 40-65 years, free of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, identified from the population register of a general practice in Ely, Cambridgeshire (n = 4936) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1990-1992, one third (n = 1705), selected randomly, received an invitation for screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> at 5-yearly intervals (screened population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the remainder of the sampling frame, 1705 randomly selected individuals were invited to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening 10 years later (unscreened population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients without known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from both populations were invited for a health assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 3390 eligible individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 1442 (43%) attended for health assessment, with no significant difference in attendance between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen years after the commencement of screening, self-rated functional health status and health utility were identical between the screened and unscreened populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical measures, self-reported medication and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not associated with long-term harms at the population level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, screening has limited long-term impact on those testing negative; benefits may largely be restricted to those whose <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is detected early through screening </plain></SENT>
