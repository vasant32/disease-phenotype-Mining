<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, available data on the effectiveness of education with respect to the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether adherence to lifestyle behavior modification prompted by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education was influenced by the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-five people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited for an intensive, collaborative, group-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education program with annual reinforcement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into two groups based on the duration of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prior to the education program (≤1 year [≤1Y] vs. ≥3 years [≥3Y]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dietary habits, physical activity, and the frequency of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring were evaluated with a questionnaire prior to education and at the follow-up endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 32.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1C) value was significantly lower in the ≤1Y group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Self-care behaviors, measured by scores for dietary habits (P=0.004) and physical activity (P&lt;0.001), were higher at the endpoint in the ≤1Y group than in the ≥3Y group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that a longer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration before education was significantly associated with mean A1C levels greater than or equal to 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> duration influenced the effectiveness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education on lifestyle behavior modification and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More-intense, regular, and sustained reinforcement with encouragement may be required for individuals with longstanding type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
