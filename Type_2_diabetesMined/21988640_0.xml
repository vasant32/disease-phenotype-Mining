<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: People from South Asian backgrounds living in the UK have a greatly increased risk of developing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether or not this patient group also experience high rates of depressive symptoms (known to be the case in Caucasian populations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) remains unknown, partly because it is unclear whether the screening tools used are culturally relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop culturally competent translations (in both written and audio formats) of two screening tools used to measure symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in languages with no written form and establish their face validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adults with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from two South Asian minority ethnic groups (from Bangladesh and Pakistan) whose main language is only spoken (Sylheti and Mirpuri) were recruited via the Birmingham Heartlands Hospital <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants attended two focus group meetings to consider the content and method of delivery of two questionnaires measuring symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the World Health Organization Well-being Index (WHO-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Culturally equivalent content was achieved for both questionnaires in both languages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Mirpuri men and women groups did not indicate a clear preference for either mode of questionnaire delivery; however, the Sylheti groups' preference was for independent audio-delivery in their spoken language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The face validity of the PHQ-9 and the WHO-5 was established for Sylheti and Mirpuri in an audio delivery format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Psychometric testing is now needed among minority ethnic populations so that the feasibility of wider use can be determined </plain></SENT>
