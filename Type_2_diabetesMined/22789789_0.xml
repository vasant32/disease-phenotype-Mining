<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study involved 123 patients who were assigned to receive either standard care or with additional diaphragmatic breathing for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the control group, diaphragmatic breathing resulted in significant reduction in body mass index, waist-hip ratio, fasting and post prandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, malondialdehyde, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and improvement in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in waist circumference, blood pressure and vitamin E in intervention group at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that diaphragmatic breathing can be employed as an effective therapy in reducing the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> while it can be incorporated as an add-on therapy to standard care in improving the anthropometry and glycemic parameters in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
