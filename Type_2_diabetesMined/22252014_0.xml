<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) is often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, this article reviews the relationship between treatment of T2DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The review presents the recent French data on the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>, and discusses the implications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> for the treatment of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prescribing data are presented for various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatments, and the use of the more commonly prescribed medications is discussed with reference to T2DM patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In France, it is estimated that 4-5% of the general population has T2DM and that almost 40% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal failure</z:hpo> have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> are both risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control is pivotal in T2DM patients for minimizing the risk of vascular complications and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e>, particularly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> who also have a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas poorly controlled glycaemia increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> and its progression, the risk is diminished in patients treated intensively for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in those who achieve stable glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intensive multitargeted treatment can also help to decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality, especially if started early in patients who have not yet developed macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In recent years, considerable improvement has been observed in France regarding the follow-up of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Less extensive, but nonetheless significant, improvement has also been observed in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, even though treatment decisions generally take renal function into account, some at-risk treatments are often still being used in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
