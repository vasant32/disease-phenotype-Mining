<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Evaluate the effects of two dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and vildagliptin, known to have different efficacy on mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and on systemic inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective, randomized, open-label PROBE design (parallel group with a blinded end point) study was performed in 90 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study assigned 45 patients to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (100 mg once daily; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group) and 45 patients to receive vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily; vildagliptin group) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAGE, evaluated during 48 h of continuous subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring, allowed an assessment of daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuations at baseline and after 12 weeks in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (nitrotyrosine) and systemic levels of inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18 was performed at baseline and after 12 weeks in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS HbA(1c), fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, MAGE, and inflammatory and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers were similar between the groups at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, MAGE (P &lt; 0.01) was lower in the vildagliptin group than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment, HbA(1c) and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> evidenced similar changes between the groups (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin treatment was associated with a stronger decrease in nitrotyrosine (P &lt; 0.01), IL-6 (P &lt; 0.05), and IL-18 (P &lt; 0.05) than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nitrotyrosine and IL-6 changes significantly correlated with changes in MAGE but not in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS MAGE reduction is associated with reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and markers of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects were greater in the vildagliptin group than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
