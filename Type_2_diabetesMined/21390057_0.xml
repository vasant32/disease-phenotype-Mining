<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the predictive ability of 24-hour ambulatory pulse pressure (24-h PP), ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and diurnal blood pressure (BP) parameters for fatal and non-fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 108 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (mean duration 6.6 years) were followed for 9.5 (0.5-14.5) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent ambulatory BP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 45 patients had cardiovascular (CV) events (35 non-fatal and 10 fatal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In bivariate analysis, events during follow-up were predicted by 24-h PP (P&lt;0.01), AASI, 24-h systolic BP and systolic and diastolic night-day BP ratio (P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analysis adjusted for established risk markers, only 24-h PP and systolic night-day BP ratio predicted CV events, P&lt;0.05 for both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction between the two parameters was found, P&lt;0.05; thus, the higher the systolic night-day ratio, the greater the increase in hazard ratio (HR) per mmHg increase in 24-h PP and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combined 10â€‰mmHg increase in 24-h PP and 10%-point increase in systolic night-day ratio from the 25th percentile increased the adjusted HR (95% confidence interval) for CV events with 1.29 (0.53; 3.12), whereas a similar increase from the 75th percentile increased the HR with 4.2 (1.54; 11,51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that 24-h PP and systolic night-day ratio interact as predictors of CV events in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, and should be considered in conjunction when evaluating the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
