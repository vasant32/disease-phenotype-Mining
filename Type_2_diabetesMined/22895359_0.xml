<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critically discuss the strengths and shortcomings of recent progress achieved with bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), focussing on efficacy aspects (remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cardiovascular comorbidities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite an increasing armamentarium of pharmacotherapeutics to overcome several challenges, only 10% of T2DM patients achieve a composite goal of HbA1c, blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bariatric surgery has emerged as a solution to these challenges in morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether the same advantages can be translated into T2DM remains a matter of debate, certainly regarding safety, durability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recovery and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Bariatric surgery in T2DM patients with a BMI of at least 35 kg/m has been shown to result in a 56% excess body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 62%, amelioration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> in greater than 70% and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remission in 57-95%, depending on the type of surgery and the definition of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These impressive results, and the fact that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recovery often occurs before prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> is evident, have urged bariatric surgeons to consider surgical procedures as a valuable approach for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remission in patients with a BMI ranging between 30 and 35 kg/m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Bariatric surgery is emerging as a valid option to treat T2DM, improving glycaemia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there needs to be an agreed definition of resolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in future studies and long-term efficacy is to be proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For now, the challenge is to determine how to offer bariatric surgery in a responsible fashion </plain></SENT>
