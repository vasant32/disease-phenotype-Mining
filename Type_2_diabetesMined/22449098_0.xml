<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm, 16-week, phase IV study, 313 subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with premixed insulin plus OADs were switched to insulin glargine plus OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in glycaemic control, incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and treatment satisfaction using the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Switching to insulin glargine was associated with significant reductions in levels of glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c); 8.4 ± 0.6 to 7.9 ± 1.0%; p &lt; 0.001) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG; 9.50 ± 2.10 to 6.58 ± 2.07 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 32.9% of subjects experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, including two cases of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction was improved with insulin glargine (DTSQ 8-item scores, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between baseline HbA(1c), disease duration, endpoint FPG and HbA(1c) &lt; 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This single-arm study suggested that switching to insulin glargine plus OADs significantly improved glycaemic control, with a low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> uncontrolled on premixed insulin plus OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Switching to insulin glargine was also associated with better patient treatment satisfaction compared with previous treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main limitations to this study are the open-label design and the lack of a control arm </plain></SENT>
