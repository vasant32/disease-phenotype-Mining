<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin, a <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> co-transporter-2 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850855" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed efficacy of three lower doses in recently diagnosed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assigned treatment-naïve patients to placebo or dapagliflozin monotherapy (1, 2.5 or 5 mg) daily for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug-naïve with inadequate glycaemic control [<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) ≥7.0 and ≤10.0%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included changes in body weight and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), and proportions achieving HbA1c &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 282 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were similar across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At week 24, mean HbA1c reduction was significantly greater with dapagliflozin: -0.68% for 1 mg, -0.72% for 2.5 mg, -0.82% for 5 mg, versus 0.02% for placebo (p &lt; 0.0001); compared to mean baseline values of 7.8-8.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean FPG reduction was significantly greater for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dapagliflozin groups versus placebo (p &lt; 0.02), as was mean weight reduction (p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the treatment period, 19.1% of placebo-treated patients received rescue medication or discontinued because of poor glycaemic control versus 6.9, 4.1 and 5.9% for dapagliflozin 1, 2.5 and 5 mg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Percentages of patients experiencing ≥1 adverse event were similar across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin at doses of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/day is effective in reducing glycaemic levels and body weight in treatment-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
