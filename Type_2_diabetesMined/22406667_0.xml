<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant myocardial injury before overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in DM can be identified early using echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study therefore aimed at evaluating left ventricular structure and function of patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty adult type 2 DM patients were recruited with 150 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients and subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, pregnancy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> and structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants were evaluated clinically; had anthropometric parameters and electrocardiogram taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiograms were obtained according to the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of the patients (55.4 ± 11.6 years) was similar to that of the control (54.2 ± 9.6 years) (P=0.348) and the duration of DM was 4.53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) systolic function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in both groups but was higher in patients than controls (ejection fraction=70.3 ± 10.7% and 64.4 ± 9.4%, P =0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) was 72% in the patients compared with 6% in controls (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients' age, body weight, duration of DM, LV mass index and left atrial dimension were positive correlates of LVDD while patients' age, weight and left atrial dimension were independent predictors of LVDD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of alterations in LV structure and function in normotensive type 2 DM; and there is a need for early intervention to prevent overt LV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
