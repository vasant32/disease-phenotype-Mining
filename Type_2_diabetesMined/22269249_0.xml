<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of increased renal resistive index and related factors among patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with different levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Laboratory analyses, including calculation of 24-h urinary albumin excretion and 24-h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, and renal doppler ultrasonography to measure renal resistive index, were carried out for patients newly diagnosed with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants were classified into four groups according to 24-h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and 24-h urinary albumin excretion levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was composed of 73 patients (54.1%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 24-h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and 24-h urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 2 was composed of 34 (25.2%) patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 24-h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and increased 24-h urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 3 was composed of 14 (10.4%) patients with decreased 24-h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 24-h urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 4 was composed of 14 (10.4%) patients with both decreased 24-h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and increased 24-h urinary albumin excretion  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, 41 patients (30.4%) had increased renal resistive index levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the four groups with respect to increased renal resistive index revealed: among group 1 patients, 10 (13.7%) had increased renal resistive index levels; among group 2 patients, 14 (41.2%) had increased renal resistive index levels; among group 3 patients, eight (57.1%) had increased renal resistive index levels; among group 4 patients, nine (64.3%) had increased renal resistive index levels (P&lt;0.0001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression, 24-h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (P&lt;0.0001), but not 24-h urinary albumin excretion, was related to increased renal resistive index levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Renal resistive index levels were highest in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with both decreased 24-h <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and increased 24-h urinary albumin excretion, whereas they were lowest in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
