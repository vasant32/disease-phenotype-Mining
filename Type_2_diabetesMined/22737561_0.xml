<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Continuous performing of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors was shown to be an effective strategy to control <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to prevent or reduce its- related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate predictors of self-care behavior based on the extended theory of reasoned action by self efficacy (ETRA) among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of 352 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, referring to a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Clinic in Khoy, Iran using the nonprobability sampling was enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Appropriate instruments were designed to measure the variables of interest (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge, personal beliefs, subjective norm, self-efficacy and behavioral intention along with self- care behaviors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reliability and validity of the instruments using Cronbach's alpha coefficients (the values of them were more than 0.70) and a panel of experts were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistical significant correlation existed between independent constructs of proposed model and modelrelated dependent constructs, as ETRA model along with its related external factors explained 41.5% of variance of intentions and 25.3% of variance of actual behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among constructs of model, self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of intentions among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as it lonely explained 31.3% of variance of intentions and 11.4% of variance of self-care behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The high ability of the extended theory of reasoned action with self-efficacy in forecasting and explaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> self management can be a base for educational intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>So to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self management behavior and to control the disease, use of educational interventions based on proposed model is suggested </plain></SENT>
