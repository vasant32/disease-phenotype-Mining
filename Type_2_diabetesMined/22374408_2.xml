<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess whether selective pharmacological activation of this receptor by TAK-875 in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> improved glycaemic control without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled and active-comparator-controlled trial in outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had not responded to diet or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned equally to receive placebo, TAK-875 (6·25, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (4 mg) once daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01007097 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 426 patients were randomly assigned to TAK-875 (n=303), placebo (n=61), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (n=62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At week 12, significant least-squares mean reductions in HbA(1c) from baseline occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TAK-875 (ranging from -1·12% [SE 0·113] with 50 mg to -0·65% [0·114] with 6·25 mg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (-1·05% [SE 0·111]) groups versus placebo (-0·13% [SE 0·115]; p value range 0·001 to &lt;0·0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment-emergent hypoglycaemic events were similar in the TAK-875 and placebo groups (2% [n=7, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TAK-875 groups] vs 3% [n=2]); significantly higher rates were reported in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group (19% [n=12]; p value range 0·010-0·002 vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TAK-875 groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in the TAK-875 overall (49%; n=147, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TAK-875 groups) and placebo groups (48%, n=29) and was lower than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group (61%, n=38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: TAK-875 significantly improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with minimum risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results show that activation of FFAR1 is a viable therapeutic target for treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
