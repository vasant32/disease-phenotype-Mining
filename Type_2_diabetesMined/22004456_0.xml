<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective community-based cohort study was conducted among adults aged 35 years and older during 2004-2007 in Nanjing, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four communities (three urban and one rural) were randomly selected from 11 urban districts and two rural counties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperglycaemia</z:e> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were defined using World Health Organization criteria based on fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and physicians' diagnosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical activity, parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> history, and other important covariates were assessed at baseline and in the third-year follow-up survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At study conclusion data were collected from 3031 participants (follow-up rate 81.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6.2% and 2.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounding variables, compared with those with positive family history and insufficient physical activity, the adjusted relative risk ratio (95% CI) of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> was 0.19 (0.02, 1.51) for participants with sufficient physical activity and a positive family history; 0.55 (0.31, 0.97) for participants with insufficient physical activity and a negative family history; and 0.36 (0.19, 0.70) for participants with sufficient physical activity but a negative family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants who had a negative family history and insufficient physical activity were also less likely to develop Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RRR = 0.28; 0.14, 0.54), and participants with a negative family history and sufficient physical activity were the least likely to develop Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.23; 0.10, 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient physical activity and negative family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may jointly reduce the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese adults </plain></SENT>
