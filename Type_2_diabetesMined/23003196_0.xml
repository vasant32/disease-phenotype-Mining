<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to further our understanding of factors that influence the decisional process of familial risk disclosure in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 546) filled in a questionnaire assessing family risk perception, worry, personal beliefs regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related family communication, intention and perceived ability to inform relatives about familial risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed using hierarchical logistic regression and multiple mediation analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty per cent of the patients were willing to inform their relatives about familial <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk; 61% reported high family risk perception and 41% had positive control beliefs with regard to preventive options in relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A majority (69%) did not express serious concern about relatives developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Worry about relatives, knowing what to tell, whom to notify, and communication about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in general appeared to facilitate family risk disclosure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, high family risk perception in itself did not significantly increase patients' intentions to inform relatives; rather, risk perception appeared to exert an indirect effect through worry and beliefs about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Worry in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appears to be a key factor in the process of family risk disclosure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When professionals guide their patients in this process, they should not only provide risk information, but also address worries and emphasize opportunities for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
