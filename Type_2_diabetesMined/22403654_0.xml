<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this large population-based study was to evaluate self-reported medication adherence and to identify factors linked with poor adherence in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The ENTRED study 2007, a French national survey of people treated for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was based on a representative sample of patients who claimed reimbursement for oral hypoglycaemic agents and/or insulin at least three times between August 2006 and July 2007, and who were randomly selected from the database of the two main National Health Insurance Systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medication adherence was determined using a six-item self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multinomial polychotomous logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with medication adherence in the 3,637 persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty nine percent of patients reported good medication adherence, 49% medium adherence and 12% poor adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The factors significantly associated with poor adherence in multivariate analysis were socio-demographic factors: age &lt;45 years, non-European geographical origin, financial difficulties and being professionally active; disease and therapy-related factors: HbA(1c)&gt;8% and existing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications; and health care-related factors: difficulties for taking medication alone, decision making by the patient only, poor acceptability of medical recommendations, lack of family or social support, need for information on treatment, reporting no confidence in the future, need for medical support and follow-up by a specialist physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a country with a high level of access to healthcare, our study demonstrated a substantial low level of medication adherence in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Better identification of those with poor adherence and individualised suitable recommendations remain essential for better healthcare management </plain></SENT>
