<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, disturbance in trace element status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of present study was to compare the concentration of essential trace elements, zinc, copper, iron, and <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> in serum of patients who have type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (n = 20) with those of nondiabetic control subjects (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum concentrations of zinc, copper, iron, and <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> were measured by means of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Shimadzu AA 670, Kyoto, Japan) after acid digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this study showed that the mean values of zinc, copper, and <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> were significantly lower in the serum of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as compared to the control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that deficiency of some essential trace elements may play a role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
