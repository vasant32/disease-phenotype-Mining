<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we asked if type 2 DM and elevated body mass index (BMI) are independent risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> (HGG.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 171 patients surgically treated for HGG at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMI and records of pre-existing type 2 DM were obtained from medical histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with survival in a univariate analysis were included in the multivariate Cox model if P &lt; 0.10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variables with probability values &gt;0.05 were then removed from the multivariate model in a step-wise fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis was 55.0 Â± 17.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (8.8%) patients had a history of type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight (35.8%) patients had a BMI &lt; 25, 55 (34.0%) BMI 25-30, and 49(30.2%) BMI &gt; 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Radiation therapy, temozolomide, and higher KPS score were independently associated with prolonged survival while increasing age was associated with decreased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DM (P = 0.001) and increasing BMI (P = 0.003) were found to be independently associated with decreased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diabetics had a decreased median overall survival (312 vs. 470 days, P = 0.003) and PFS (106 vs. 166 days, P = 0.04) compared to non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increasing BMI (&lt;25, 25-30, and &gt;30) was also associated with decreased median PFS: 195 vs. 165 vs. 143 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pre-existing DM and elevated BMI are independent risk factors for poor outcome in patients with HGG </plain></SENT>
