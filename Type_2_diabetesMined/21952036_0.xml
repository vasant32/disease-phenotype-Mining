<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It was reported previously that isolated human islets from individuals with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) show reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the possibility that impaired bioenergetics may contribute to this defect, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated respiration (Vo(2)), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> usage and oxidation, intracellular Ca(2+), and insulin secretion (IS) were measured in pancreatic islets isolated from three healthy and three type 2 diabetic organ donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated mouse and rat islets were studied for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Islets were exposed to a "staircase" <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulus, whereas IR and Vo(2) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vo(2) of human islets from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and diabetics increased sigmoidally from equal baselines of 0.25 nmol/100 islets/min as a function of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximal Vo(2) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> islets at 24 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 0.40 ± 0.02 nmol·min(-1)·100 islets(-1), and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> S(0.5) was 4.39 ± 0.10 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation of respiration of islets from diabetics was lower, V(max) of 0.32 ± 0.01 nmol·min(-1)·100 islets(-1), and the S(0.5) shifted to 5.43 ± 0.13 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated IS and the rise of intracellular Ca(2+) were also reduced in diabetic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A clinically effective glucokinase activator normalized the defective Vo(2), IR, and free calcium responses during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation in islets from type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The body of data shows that there is a clear relationship between the pancreatic islet energy (ATP) production rate and IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This relationship was similar for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human, mouse, and rat islets and the data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species fitted a single sigmoidal curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The shared threshold rate for IS was ∼13 pmol·min(-1)·islet(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Exendin-4, a GLP-1 analog, shifted the ATP production-IS curve to the left and greatly potentiated IS with an ATP production rate threshold of ∼10 pmol·min(-1)·islet(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that impaired β-cell bioenergetics resulting in greatly reduced ATP production is critical in the molecular pathogenesis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
