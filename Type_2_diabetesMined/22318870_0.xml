<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a marker of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a general population sample in Eastern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis in the Kuopio <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Ischaemic Heart Disease</z:e> Risk Factor Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 850 men and 906 women, aged 53-73 years, were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative risk (RR) of prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was estimated as odds ratios by logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between serum 25(OH)D and markers of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in tertiles of serum 25(OH)D concentration were assessed by linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 43.4 nmol/L (SD 17.6, range 8.5-122.8 nmol/L) in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum 25(OH)D concentration &lt;50 nmol/L were observed in 65.5% of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum 25(OH)D was inversely associated with fasting serum insulin, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels after adjustment for age, gender and examination year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Association with the OGTT 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> remained statistically significant after multivariate adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RR (95% confidence interval) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in tertiles of serum 25(OH)D were 1, 1.26 (0.86, 1.85) and 1.44 (0.96, 2.15) after multivariate adjustments (p for trend = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low serum 25(OH)D is associated with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin metabolism </plain></SENT>
