<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed regional variations in the prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of subjects aged 45-74 years from five regional population-based studies and one nationwide study conducted between 1997 and 2006 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treatment, and diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence estimates (95% confidence interval) from regional studies were directly standardized to the German population (31 December 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 11,688 participants of the regional studies, 1008 had known Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, corresponding to a prevalence of 8.6% (8.1-9.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the nationwide study, a prevalence of 8.2% (7.3-9.2%) was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was higher in men (9.7%; 8.9-10.4%) than in women (7.6%; 6.9-8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regional standardized prevalence was highest in the east with 12.0% (10.3-13.7%) and lowest in the south with 5.8% (4.9-6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among persons with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents was more frequently reported in the south (56.9%) and less in the northeast (46.0%), whereas treatment with insulin alone was more frequently reported in the northeast (21.6%) than in the south (16.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of known Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed a southwest-to-northeast gradient within Germany, which is in accord with regional differences in the distribution of risk factors for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents showed regional differences </plain></SENT>
