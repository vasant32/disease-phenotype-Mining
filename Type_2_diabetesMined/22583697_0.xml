<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial, 288 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> T2DM received either 12.5 or 25 mg alogliptin once daily + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or placebo + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, 276 patients continued on one of the two alogliptin dosages + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in an open-label extension for 40 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint in the randomized, double-blind phase was the change in HbA1c from baseline (week 0) to the end of treatment (week 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint during the long-term extension phase was adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 weeks both dosages of alogliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> produced significantly greater changes from baseline in HbA1c than placebo (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy: with changes in LS means - 0.55 and - 0.64% vs. 0.22%, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidences of adverse effects were comparable between groups, with no increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 52 weeks, there were no safety or tolerability concerns with alogliptin when added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg once daily was safe and effective when added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (500 or 750 mg/day) in Japanese patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
