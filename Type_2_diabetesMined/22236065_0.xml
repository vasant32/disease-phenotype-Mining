<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim:  To characterize the numbers of reagent strips dispensed for self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Tayside, Scotland, in 1993, 1999 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods:  A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinical information system in Tayside, record-linked to electronic dispensed prescribing records, was used to collate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dispensed prescribing records for three cross-sectional samples of patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1993 (n = 5728), 1999 (n = 8109) and at 1 January 2009 (n = 16 450) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The numbers of reagent strips dispensed during the relevant calendar year were calculated and patients stratified by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also explored whether age, sex or material and social deprivation were associated with whether a patient received strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results:  Proportions of people who received self-monitoring reagent strips increased from 15.5% in 1993, to 24.2% in 1999 to 29.8% in 2009, as did numbers of strips dispensed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the proportion of diet-treated patients who received reagent strips was still very low in 2009 (5.6%), the proportion among those treated with oral agents tripled from 9.4 to 27.4% between 1993 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over 90% of patients treated with insulin received reagent strips and, among non-insulin-treated patients, this was more common among women, younger people and less deprived groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  The numbers of reagent strips dispensed for self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> has increased and almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulin-treated patients receive strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While few diet-treated patients receive strips, they are more extensively dispensed to those treated with oral agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given that self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is no longer routinely recommended in non-insulin treated patients, strategies to reduce unnecessary dispensing of reagent strips are needed. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
