<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 370 patients (mean age 60.3±8.3 years and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 8.6±6.2 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> were enrolled in a cross sectional study during 2006-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors of ABI, considering systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, glycemia, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, creatinin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>Peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> was detected in 82.35% (280 pts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean ABI value of 0.97±0.33, and its minimal value of 0.95±0.38 was detected in this study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis demonstrated that mean and minimal values of ABI were independently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (β 0.120, 95% CI -0.014, -0.001) and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> level (β -0.126, 95% CI -0.020, -0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results might have clinical implications for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in defining those with a long <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration and a higher blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> level to have greater probability of detecting pathological ankle-brachial index </plain></SENT>
