<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Research on young healthy samples suggests that low glycaemic load foods can confer benefits for cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to examine the effects of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on cognitive function, and to investigate whether consumption of low glycaemic load breakfasts affects cognitive function in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Memory, psychomotor skill and executive function were examined at two morning test sessions in 24 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 10 adults with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) aged 45-77 years without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after water, low, and high glycaemic load breakfasts were consumed in accordance with a crossover, counterbalanced design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and NGT groups were matched for education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and IQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with impairments in verbal memory, spatial memory, psychomotor skill, and executive function compared to adults with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consumption of the three breakfast conditions did not impact on cognitive performance in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or NGT participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can have demonstrable negative effects on a range of cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no evidence that low GL breakfasts administered acutely could confer benefits for cognitive function (ClincalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01047813) </plain></SENT>
