<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here systematically review (PRISMA guidelines) the results of high-quality double blind trials testing whether cholesterol-lowering drugs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and fibrates) reduce mortality and cardiovascular complications specifically in type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trials with premature termination without pertinent medical justification or using nonrandomized subgroups of diabetics were excluded from the review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only four trials met our predefined inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 3 statin trials, CARDS was discontinued 2 years before the anticipated end and in the absence of significant effect on both overall and cardiovascular mortality, suggesting that the trial should not have been prematurely stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> trials showed no significant effect on the primary endpoint (relative risk 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10 in 4D and 0.90, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12 in ASPEN) and on both cardiovascular and overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the fibrate trial (FIELD) showed no significant benefit on the primary endpoint (relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05) and mortality (relative risk 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of a huge medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between patients in the selected trials, it was consensually decided to stop the analysis at this stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review does not support the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs (such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> and fibrate) to reduce mortality and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Official guidelines should be re-examined and reformulated by experts independent from the pharmaceutical industry </plain></SENT>
