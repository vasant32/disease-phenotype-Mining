<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG), including self-regulation, is an important tool to achieve good glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many patients measure their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations less often than is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates patients' perspectives of SMBG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant aspects influencing SMBG in patients with type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In depth interviews were conducted with 13 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from an outpatient clinic and 15 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from general practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the Grounded Theory approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A wide variety of SMBG was encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perceptions, goals of SMBG and personal and contextual factors were identified, influencing the respondents' perspective of SMBG, and leading to this variety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Respondents experienced a discrepancy between their own and the professionals' perceptions and goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Respondents' perception of SMBG ranged along a continuum from 'friend' to 'foe' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to the goals, the respondents experienced tension between achieving good glycemic control and quality of life, and deliberately made their own choices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The performance of SMBG was tailored to their perceptions and personal goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Personal and contextual factors such as hypo- or hyper (un)awareness, knowledge, and contact with professionals acted as either facilitating factors or as barriers to SMBG, depending on the respondents' perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A SMBG model was developed providing a representation of the factors and their interrelations.Respondents with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seemed more resigned to their situation and SMBG was more integrated into their lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From the patients' perspective, professionals positively present SMBG as a 'friend' in order to achieve strict glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whereas patients can also perceive SMBG as a 'foe' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They primarily seek a personal balance between achieving glycemic control and quality of life, leading them to deliberately make other choices regarding SMBG performance than was recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Gaining insight and discussing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> factors affecting SMBG will help professionals and patients come to mutually agreed goals and to tailor the performance of SMBG to the individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This should result in a more optimal use of SMBG, an improved quality of life, and improved clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
