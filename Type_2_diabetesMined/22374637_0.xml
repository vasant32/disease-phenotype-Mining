<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the effect of baseline cognitive function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> on subsequent risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and to assess the effect of different glycemic strategies on these relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective cohort analysis of data from the ACCORD trial included 2,956 adults aged â‰¥55 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive tests (Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST], Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Stroop Test, and Mini Mental Status Examination) were conducted at baseline and 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study outcomes were incident confirmed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> requiring medical assistance (HMA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> requiring any assistance (HAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median 3.25-year follow-up, a 5-point-poorer baseline score on the DSST was predictive of a first episode of HMA (hazard ratio 1.13 [95% CI 1.08-1.18]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the other cognitive tests and of HAA were consistent with the DSST results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> over 20 months increased the risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> to a greater extent in those with lower baseline cognitive function (P(interaction) = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Randomization to an intensive versus standard glycemic strategy had no impact on the relationship between cognitive function and the risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poor cognitive function increases the risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should consider cognitive function in assessing and guiding their patients regarding safe <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management regardless of their glycemic targets </plain></SENT>
