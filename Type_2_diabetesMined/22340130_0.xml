<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> risk assessment has been proposed as part of the National Health Service Health Checks programme, and HbA(1c) has recently been recommended as a diagnostic test for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a threshold of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated the potential population impact of different stepwise screening strategies to identify individuals at high risk who might be offered preventive interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data from 5910 participants in the European Prospective Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort with HbA(1c) measurements, we modelled different stepwise screening strategies for identifying and treating individuals at high risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using different HbA(1c) cut-off points with and without a stage of prestratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each strategy, we estimated the number needed to have a diagnostic test, the number needed to treat to prevent one new case of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the number of new cases that could be prevented in the population over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative risk reductions for estimated effects of intensive lifestyle intervention were derived from the US <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with inviting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals in an average primary care trust for a diagnostic test, a stepwise screening approach using simple routine data such as age and anthropometric indices could prevent a slightly lower number (lower-upper estimates) of new cases of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 3 years (224 [130-359] and 193 [109-315] cases respectively) but would only require half the population to be invited for a diagnostic blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 162 (88-274) cases could be prevented by inviting individuals with a Cambridge risk score of â‰¥ 0.15, with only 40% of the total population requiring diagnostic blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a participant completed questionnaire for risk assessment (FINDRISC) was less effective, mainly relating to the questionnaire response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Providing preventive interventions to those with a lower HbA(1c) of 37-&lt; 48 mmol/mol (5.5-&lt; 6.5%) could prevent more cases but with a disproportionately higher workload, compared with using the recommended HbA(1c) threshold of 42-&lt; 48 mmol/mol (6.0-&lt; 6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with mass screening, an approach using routine data for risk stratification followed by an HbA(1c) test with a threshold of 42-&lt; 48 mmol/mol (6.0-&lt; 6.5%) for identifying individuals suitable for preventive interventions might prevent slightly fewer cases of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but with potential cost-savings </plain></SENT>
