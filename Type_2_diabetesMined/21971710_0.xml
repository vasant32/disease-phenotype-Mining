<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine longitudinally the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on bone structure and metabolism, we measured bone mineral density (BMD) and turnover markers in 26 type 1 (mean age 49 years) and 27 type 2 (mean age 65 years) diabetic patients without known <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> from a community-based sample at baseline and 5 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 17 type 1 men, BMD fell at the femoral neck (0.804 ± 0.145 vs. 0.769 ± 0.129 g/cm(2); P = 0.003) with no change at lumbar spine or forearm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 11 type 2 women, BMD decreased at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites except spine (femoral neck 0.779 ± 0.119 vs. 0.742 ± 0.090 g/cm(2); P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMD did not fall at any site in type 1 women or type 2 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and trend to higher serum beta carboxyl-terminal type I collagen telopeptide concentrations in the type 1 patients, and a decrease in free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> in the type 1 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that the rate of demineralization at the femoral neck in type 1 men is similar to that in older post-menopausal type 2 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in biochemical markers suggest that, in type 1 men, there is ineffective bone formation associated with accelerated bone resorption and lower sex steroid bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for the clinical management of young male adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
