<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>Impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been classified as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies have revealed that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an autoinflammatory disease due to an imbalance of inflammatory cytokine production and related molecular components that cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) system are known to be involved in the development of experimental diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and urinary IGFBP3 protease activity has been observed in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A serine protease was found to be responsible for the proteolytic activity in diabetic urine; however, the identity of the precise enzyme remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated neutrophil proteinase 3 (PR3) to see whether it has specific enzymatic activity associated with insulin-like growth factor-1 and IGFBP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our study, both molecules were sufficiently degraded, which leads us to believe that PR3 may induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the mouse model utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that PR3 in the urine of diabetic patients similarly affects <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PR3-immunized mice had an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance due to inhibition of PR3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As such, PR3 can be considered as an inflammatory enzyme directly linking <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through downregulation of insulin-like growth factor-1/IGFBP3 </plain></SENT>
