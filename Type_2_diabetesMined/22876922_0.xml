<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin represents one of the most abundant and well-studied adipokines that has been implicated as a major protective factor against the adverse metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin results from decrease in hepatic gluconeogenesis and increase in muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport and, secondly from enhancement of energy consumption and fatty acid oxidation in peripheral tissues with the aim of increasing ATP production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides these effects, the potential role of adiponectin on insulin secretion, as well as on energy expenditure, through central action, has also been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence from clinical, experimental animal and genetic studies support a close association between hypoadiponectinemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The question that arises is whether hypoadiponectinemia is the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or the cause of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the observation that various drug classes exert beneficial effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> partly by increasing plasma adiponectin levels, it could hypothesized that substances that enhance or mimic adiponectin to activate its receptors and/or postreceptor signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the prevention and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, many questions need to be addressed before adiponectin can be used as a potent therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
