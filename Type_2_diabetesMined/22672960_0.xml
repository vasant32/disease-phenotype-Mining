<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> continues to evolve as new data emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although glycaemic control is still important, other risk factors - such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> - must also be addressed in order to reduce the long-term risks of cardiovascular complications and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, targeting the incretin system, and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) in particular, has generated much interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 is released from the gut in response to food ingestion and plays a crucial role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the heart and vasculature, prompting evaluation of their physiological role and pharmacological stimulation, both in healthy and <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that GLP-1 and GLP-1-based therapies appear to have direct, beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, in addition to their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering properties, such as modulation of blood pressure, endothelial function, and myocardial contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, some of these effects appear to be independent of GLP-1 receptor signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data from clinical studies of the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, exenatide and liraglutide on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are also promising and the results from prospective studies to assess cardiovascular outcomes are eagerly awaited </plain></SENT>
