<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism were tissue-specific, persistent, and preceded hepatic DNA hypomethylation in type 1 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar metabolic perturbations have been shown in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> (type 2) diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> and early diabetic stages, but tissue specificity and potential impact on epigenetic marks are unknown, particularly during pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ZDF (fa/fa) and lean (+/?) control rats were killed at 12 and 21 weeks of age, representing early and advanced diabetic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood and tissues were analysed with respect to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism, including DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 12 weeks, hepatic glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), methionine synthase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> β-synthase (CBS) activity and/or abundance were increased in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 21 weeks, GNMT activity was increased in liver and kidney; however, only hepatic CBS protein abundance (12 weeks) and betaine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> S-methyltransferase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (21 weeks) were significantly elevated (78 and 100%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> N-methyltransferase expression was also elevated in the ZDF rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were decreased in plasma and kidney, but not in liver, at 12 and 21 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to hepatic DNA hypomethylation in the type 1 diabetic rat, genomic DNA was hypermethylated at 12 and 21 weeks in the liver of ZDF rats, concomitant with an increase in DNA methyltransferase 1 expression at 21 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the ZDF rat was associated with tissue and disease stage-specific aberrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism, with persistent hepatic global DNA hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
