<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether short-time, real-time continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (RT-CGM) has long-term salutary glycemic effects in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are not on prandial insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial of 100 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were not on prandial insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared the effects of 12 weeks of intermittent RT-CGM with self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) on glycemic control over a 40-week follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects received <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care from their regular provider without therapeutic intervention from the study team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference in A1C at the end of the 3-month active intervention that was sustained during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean, unadjusted A1C decreased by 1.0, 1.2, 0.8, and 0.8% in the RT-CGM group vs. 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.2% in the SMBG group at 12, 24, 38, and 52 weeks, respectively (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly greater decline in A1C over the course of the study for the RT-CGM group than for the SMBG group, after adjusting for covariates (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subjects who used RT-CGM per protocol (â‰¥48 days) improved the most (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The improvement in the RT-CGM group occurred without a greater intensification of medication compared with those in the SMBG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not on prandial insulin who used RT-CGM intermittently for 12 weeks significantly improved glycemic control at 12 weeks and sustained the improvement without RT-CGM during the 40-week follow-up period, compared with those who used only SMBG </plain></SENT>
