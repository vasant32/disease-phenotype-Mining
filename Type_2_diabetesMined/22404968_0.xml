<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTPs</z:chebi>) that antagonize IR signaling may provide a means for enhancing the insulin response and alleviating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prototypic phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase PTP1B dephosphorylates the IR and attenuates insulin signaling in muscle and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice that are deficient for PTP1B exhibit improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in diet and genetic models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phosphatase TCPTP shares 72% catalytic domain sequence identity with PTP1B and has also been implicated in IR regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite their high degree of similarity, PTP1B and TCPTP act together in vitro and in vivo to regulate insulin signaling and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review I will highlight their capacity to act specifically and non-redundantly in cellular signaling, describe their roles in IR regulation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, and discuss their potential as drug targets for the enhancement of IR phosphorylation and insulin sensitivity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
