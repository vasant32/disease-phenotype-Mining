<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to three commonly used operational definitions {World Health Organization (WHO), National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III) and International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation( IDF)} </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the agreement between these classifications in the Pakistani cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data was collected retrospectively of 210 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> visiting outpatient clinics of one of the large tertiary care hospitals at Karachi, Pakistan between June 2008 to November 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was found to be 81.4% (WHO), 86.7 % (IDF) and 91.9 % (NCEP ATPIII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of agreement (kappa statistic) was found to be highest among IDF &amp; NCEP ATPIII (0.728) as compared to (0.436 &amp; 0.417) between WHO &amp; ATP and WHO &amp; IDF respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most significant predictors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were found out to be female gender OR= 8.74 95% CI 1.51-50.53, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels OR = 0.89 95% CI 0.84-0.94 and high systolic blood pressure OR= 1.06 95% CI 1.009-1.11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study results suggested that NCEP ATPIII and IDF are the most reliable criteria for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients, with NECP capturing more patients in comparison to IDF definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alarmingly high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> found in this study suggests that primary prevention strategies should be initiated earlier and early in this ethnic group and our health care system should be geared up to cope with this deadly quartet </plain></SENT>
