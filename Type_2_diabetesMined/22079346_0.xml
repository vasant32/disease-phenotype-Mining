<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study M35, a galanin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> was used to elucidate whether exercise-induced galanin release increased GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present findings showed that plasma galanin levels after swimming training in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four trained groups were higher compared with each sedentary control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>M35 treatment had an inhibitory effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates in the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp test and GLUT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in adipocytes </plain></SENT>
