<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proponents of personalized medicine predict a future in which disease treatment and, more important, prevention will be tailored to high-risk individuals rather than populations and will be based on genetic and other new biomarker tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accurate biomarker tests to identify people at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could allow more-targeted and perhaps individualized prevention efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA variants conferring higher risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, these account for only a small fraction of genetic risk, which limits their practical predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nor has identification of these variants yet led to new, individualized prevention methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to identify genomic and other types of biomarkers that could accurately predict risk and facilitate targeted prevention </plain></SENT>
