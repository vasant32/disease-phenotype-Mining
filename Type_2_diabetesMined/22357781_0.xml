<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to identify factors related to PAD in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the best predictors for PAD development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-control study was conducted in which 405 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were recruited from four tertiary care hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with PAD who were compared to those without PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ankle-brachial index (ABI) &lt; 0.9 was used for PAD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An ABI between 0.91 and 1.30 was used to define those without PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care activities score and chief complaints were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thai type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with PAD were older (65.45 Â± 12.2 years), had no formal schooling, and were more likely to be a local vendor than those without PAD (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with PAD had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> longer than those without PAD (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> were significantly more common in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with PAD than those without PAD (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; 70 years, having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> as a comorbid illness, and having a body mass index of 25-29.9 kg/m(2) were predictive for PAD development (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These three variables explained 12.3% of the variance in the incidence of PAD among type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The demographic and clinical factors were the best predictors for PAD development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thai type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients who are elderly, have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> as a comorbid condition, or have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight should be considered at risk for PAD development </plain></SENT>
