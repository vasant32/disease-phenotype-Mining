<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown if <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk is associated with parental longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated participants in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program with a parental history questionnaire at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We classified them into five groups: premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at age &lt; 50 years), parental longevity (living to at least 80 years), and three intermediate groups (alive by age 49 but dying at age 50-59, 60-69, or 70-79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with alive parents and younger than 80 years were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed separately effects of paternal (n = 2,165) and maternal (n = 1,739) longevity on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence and risk after an average follow-up of 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, more <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors (parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, higher body mass index, homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and corrected insulin response) were found in participants whose parents died prematurely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> incidence was 9.5 cases/100 person-years in the 229 whose fathers died prematurely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 618 with paternal longevity, the rate was 6.6 cases/100 person-years (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.68 [0.49-0.94]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rates were 10.7 cases/100 person-years (n = 156) and 7.3 cases/100 person-years (n = 699, hazard ratio = 0.67 [95% confidence interval 0.47-0.95]) for those with maternal premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or longevity, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Associations with demographic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors had minimal influence on the reduced risk found in those with paternal (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.52-1.16) and maternal (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.41-1.01) longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Parental longevity is associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in adults at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
