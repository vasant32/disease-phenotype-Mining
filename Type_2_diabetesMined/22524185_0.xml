<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies indicate that type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a large and growing threat to public health in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Asian subgroups (e.g., South Asians/Asian Indians, Chinese) have unique risk factor profiles for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which differ from other populations and between Asian ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle intervention programs are effective in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Asians, as with other ethnicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strength of these findings is lessened by the lack of systematically collected data using objective measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large epidemiologic studies of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence and risk factor profiles and translational trials identifying sustainable and culturally acceptable lifestyle programs for Asian subgroups are needed </plain></SENT>
