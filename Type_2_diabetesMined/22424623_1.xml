<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate a potential relationship between Solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter) member 8 (SLC30A8) rs13266634 variant and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or repaglinide in treating newly diagnosed Chinese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 209 diabetic patients without any antihyperglycemic history were recruited and treated with repaglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> randomly for 48 weeks (104 and 105 patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements and clinical laboratory tests were carried out before and after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An non-synonymous variant rs13266634 was genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-one patients in repaglinide group and ninety-three patients in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group completed the study. Δ value of homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function (HOMA-B) and Δ value of fasting proinsulin levels were statistically significant between three genotype groups (P=0.0149 and 0.0246, respectively) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no genotype association was observed in the repaglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group with other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The SLC30A8 variant was associated with the efficacy of insulin sensitizer monotherapy on insulin secretion in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Shanghai, China </plain></SENT>
