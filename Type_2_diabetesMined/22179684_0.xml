<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 139 Chinese women (45 with GD and 94 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) at the index pregnancy) who had their insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell functions examined at 8 years postpartum were again followed up at 15 years for the investigation of the rate of type 2 DM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with prior history of GD had a significantly higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (35.6% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.01), type 2 DM (24.4% vs. 5.3%, p &lt; 0.001) and impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (26.6% vs. 14.9%, p &lt; 0.001) than women with NGT during the index pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Matsuda insulin sensitivity index and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index at 8 years postpartum were independent predictors of both DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> at 15 years postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The conversion rate of type 2 DM increased at an average rate of 1.6% per year after a pregnancy affected by GD </plain></SENT>
