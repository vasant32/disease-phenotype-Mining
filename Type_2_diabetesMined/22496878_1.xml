<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study tested the hypothesis that SeP is related to hypoadiponectinemia in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared serum levels of SeP with those of adiponectin and other clinical parameters in 36 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also measured levels of blood adiponectin in SeP knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating SeP levels were positively correlated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r = 0.35, P = 0.037) and negatively associated with both total and high-molecular adiponectin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r = -0.355, P = 0.034; r = -0.367, P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SeP was a predictor of both total and high-molecular adiponectin, independently of age, body weight, and quantitative insulin sensitivity index (β = -0.343, P = 0.022; β = -0.357, P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SeP knockout mice exhibited an increase in blood adiponectin levels when fed regular chow or a high <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>, high fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that overproduction of liver-derived secretory protein SeP is connected with hypoadiponectinemia in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
