<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Records of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were prescribed U500 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate relationships between changes in A1C and use of U500 alone or as BBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified as using U500 alone (n=2) or in combination with long-acting (LAI) (n=7) or rapid-acting (RAI) (n=3) insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reductions in A1C (9.5% at baseline vs. 7.7% at 6-9 months, P&lt;0.0001) and increases in weight (128.8±32.7 vs. 131.5±31.3 kg, P&lt;0.014) and TDD (260±111 to 333±106 units/day, P&lt;0.0002) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concurrent use of LAI or RAI with U500 did not predict improvements in A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: U500 resulted in improvements in A1C and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and increased TDD when used alone or as part of combination insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further investigations to define the optimal use of U500 are recommended </plain></SENT>
