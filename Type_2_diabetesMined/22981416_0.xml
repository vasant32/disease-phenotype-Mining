<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined alterations in the enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defenses associated with learning deficits induced by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and studied the effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on these learning deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Learning ability was assessed by visual discrimination tasks in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, as a model of spontaneous type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29036">Cu(2+)</z:chebi>-Zn(2+) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> SOD were measured in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half the rats received oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (20mg/kg/day) from the early stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (22 weeks old) to 27 weeks old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OLETF rats showed learning deficits compared with control, Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GPx levels in the cortex and hippocampus were increased in OLETF rats compared with LETO rats, with an inverse correlation between GPx in the hippocampus and learning score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CuZn-SOD levels were also increased in the hippocampus in OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> reduced blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and increased serum adiponectin levels, but had no effect on learning tasks or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, except for CuZn-SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an oxidative imbalance reflected by increased brain <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes plays an important role in the development of learning deficits in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> administration partly ameliorated diabetic symptoms, but was unable to completely recover cerebral oxidative imbalance and functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced brain impairment, which results in learning deficits, may have occurred before the appearance of the symptoms of overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
