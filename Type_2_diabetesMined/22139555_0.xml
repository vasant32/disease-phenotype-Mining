<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A strong family history of the disease suggests the involvement of genetic factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development, but defining the molecular genetics of T2D in children is difficult due to a low number of subjects and the lack of robust diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, genetic studies of T2D have been carried out almost exclusively in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, the genetics of T2D is summarized and options for discovering the missing heritability explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The review concludes with a discussion of future research that will be required for determining genetic risk factors for pediatric T2D </plain></SENT>
