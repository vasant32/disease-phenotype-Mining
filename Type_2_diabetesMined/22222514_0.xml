<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline data obtained from a community-based intervention trial were used for this study of 83 middle-aged KAs with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study design and data analysis were guided by social cognitive theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The key variables were dictated the order of the variables in multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our findings indicated that for diabetic KAs, the primary source of social support differed according to gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unmet needs for support were significantly associated with self-care activities, but the amount of support needs and of social support received were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis also confirmed that unmet needs for social support are a significant strong predictor of inadequate type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care activities, after controlling for other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hierarchical regression model explained about 30% of total variance in self-care activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of considering unmet needs for social support when addressing self-care activities in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future interventions should focus on filling gaps in social support and tailoring approaches according to key determinants, such as gender or education level, to improve self-care activities in the context of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
