<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between ppTG and metabolic parameters, we analyzed plasma TG levels in 126 newly diagnosed, drug-naïve diabetic patients after ingestion of a standardized low calorie and fat (500 kcal, 17.5 g fat) liquid meal formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that MetS+ patients have significantly higher BMI, waist/hip ratio, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β, but insignificantly higher fasting TG, ppTG, and ΔTG than MetS- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the MetS+ patients, ppTG correlated with fasting TG and non-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, but was not related to HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In MetS- patients, ppTG correlated with fasting TG, non-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, blood pressure, waist/hip ratio, fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and insulin levels, and HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed HOMA-IR to be a predictive factor for ppTG in MetS- patients but not in MetS+ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ppTG correlated with IR in MetS- type 2 diabetic patients but not in MetS+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This unexpected result implies that MetS+ diabetic patients already have high fasting TG and that IR influences fasting TG more dominantly than ppTG </plain></SENT>
