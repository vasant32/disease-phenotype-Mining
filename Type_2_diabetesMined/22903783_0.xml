<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For children with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, QOL includes enjoying meals, feeling safe in school, and perceiving positive, supportive relationships with parents, siblings, and friends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet many treatment-related and psychosocial barriers can interfere with a child's QOL and their ability to manage <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> effectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> management also imposes considerable lifestyle demands that are difficult and often frustrating for children to negotiate at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications and technologies have improved glycemic control in children with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two widely used technologies are the insulin pump and continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These technologies provide patients with more flexibility in their daily life and information about <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several studies report improvements in glycemic control in children with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the insulin pump or sensor-augmented pump therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these technologies may impact QOL for children and families with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although they are rarely used or studied in the treatment of children with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, emerging closed loop and web- and phone-based technologies have great potential for supporting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management and perhaps QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A deeper understanding and appreciation of the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> technology on children's and parents' QOL is critical for both the medical and psychological care of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this review is to discuss the impact of new <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> technologies on QOL in children, adolescents and families with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
