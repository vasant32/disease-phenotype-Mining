<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We examined the optimal cut-off values of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2-h post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) for predicting Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in community-dwelling Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1982 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 40-79 years who underwent a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test were followed prospectively for 14 years by annual health examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up, 295 subjects developed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the first decile, the crude hazard ratio for incident Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher in the fifth fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decile [5.4-5.4 mmol/l (97-98 mg/dl)] or higher, in the seventh 2-h post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decile [6.9-7.2 mmol/l (124-131 mg/dl)] or higher, and in the fifth HbA(1c) decile [34-36 mmol/mol (5.3-5.4%)] or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These associations remained substantially unchanged even after adjustment for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off values for predicting Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 5.6 mmol/l (101 mg/dl) for fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 6.9 mmol/l (124 mg/dl) for 2-h post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 37 mmol/mol (5.5%) for HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a stratified analysis, the cut-off values were approximately 5.6 mmol/l (101 mg/dl) for fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 37 mmol/mol (5.5%) for HbA(1c), and these values were unchanged over BMI quartile levels, whereas the 2-h post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cut-off values declined with decreasing BMI levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the cut-off value for predicting Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population is 5.6 mmol/l (101 mg/dl) for fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 37 mmol/mol (5.5%) for HbA(1c), while the 2-h post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cut-off value is lower than the diagnostic criterion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
