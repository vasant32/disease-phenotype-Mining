<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that infused MSCs might also contribute to amelioration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of peripheral insulin target tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis, we induced a diabetic rat model by high-fat diet/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) administration, performed MSC infusion during the early phase (7 days) or late phase (21 days) after STZ injection, and then evaluated the therapeutic effects of MSC infusion and explored the possible mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MSC infusion ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in rats with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infusion of MSCs during the early phase not only promoted Î²-cell function but also ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, whereas infusion in the late phase merely ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infusion of MSCs resulted in an increase of GLUT4 expression and an elevation of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and Akt (protein kinase B) in insulin target tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of MSC treatment improving insulin sensitivity in T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that multiple roles and mechanisms are involved in the efficacy of MSCs in ameliorating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in T2D </plain></SENT>
