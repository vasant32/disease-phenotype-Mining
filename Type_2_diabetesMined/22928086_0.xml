<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several lines of scientific evidence have been demonstrating that a low level of physical activity and decreased daily energy expenditure leads to the accumulation of visceral fat and, consequently, the activation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> cascade, which underlies the development of insulin resistant T2DM and evolution of micro, and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper focuses on the pathophysiological pathways associated with the involvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the development of T2DM and the impact of regular physical exercise (training) as a natural <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-inflammatory strategy to prevent evolution of T2DM and its serious complications </plain></SENT>
