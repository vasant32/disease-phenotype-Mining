<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> prevalence rates in the general population are reflected in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is negatively affected in patients who are overweight or have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but physical activity (PA) is proven to have positive side effects on the perceived quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the relationship of PA with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between HRQoL and PA in type 2 diabetics in association with the severity of overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional multicenter cohort study involving 370 outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants completed the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36(®)) and the Freiburger Questionnaire for Physical Activity (FFkA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endurance capacity was tested with a 2 km walking test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>t-tests, analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation test, and multiple regression analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HRQoL is negatively affected by body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results show that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt; 35) have a lower HRQoL than overweight patients (BMI 25-29.99) and patients with grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI 30-35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HRQoL decreases with decreasing PA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dimensions of the SF-36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PA remains a significant predictor of physical composite summary (B = 0.09; β = 0.11; P &lt; 0.05), physical function (B = 0.10; β = 0.13; P &lt; 0.01), mental composite summary (B = 0.13; β = 0.20; P &lt; 0.001), vitality (B = 0.15; β = 0.24; P &lt; 0.001), and psychological well-being (B = 0.11; β = 0.18; P &lt; 0.01) when controlling for age, sex, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because of the strong association between being overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and several risk factors for morbidity and mortality, reversing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic is an urgent priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based upon the results of this study and the available evidence of the efficacy of PA for preventing and treating those who are overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, health care professionals should continue to stress the importance of PA as a treatment option </plain></SENT>
