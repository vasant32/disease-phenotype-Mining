<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To address the increasing global prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> healthcare organisations have been contemplating different screening and intervention strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient acceptability is a key criterion of a screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore the perspectives of those invited to attend the MY-WAIST screening study for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly explanations for attending or not, and views on the specific screening strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study of 11 general practices in Leicestershire, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 individuals (40-69 years) invited to attend the MY-WAIST screening study, comprising 13 who attended and 11 who did not attend the screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional data included reply slips from 73 individuals who declined the offer of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis was informed by the constant comparative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two categories of influence on the decision about attending screening emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1) Beliefs about type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> candidacy and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was more common among those who had attended; lack of perceived severity of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was more common among those who did not attend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2) Practical aspects about the screening strategy: the lengthy, early morning screening appointments were a barrier to uptake; screening attendees found the procedure largely acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre-screening waist self-measurement was more memorable than the remainder of the risk-score calculation; neither impacted on uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The barriers to screening uptake highlighted contribute to current debates about different screening and diagnostic tests for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and future risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings are useful for those contemplating implementation of screening programmes for identifying type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
