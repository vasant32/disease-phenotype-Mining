<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the feasibility of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> screening program in Romanian patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> attending outpatient clinic of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> center (the standard for routine care in Romania) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was administered to 80 consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a score &gt;10 at this scale were referred to polysomnography for a sleep study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 20% of these patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002189'>excessive daytime sleepiness</z:hpo> (Epworth Sleepiness Scale &gt;10), and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 33.3% had moderate OSA (AHI = 15-30 events/h of sleep), and 58.3% had severe OSA (AHI ≥30 events/h of sleep) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with OSA were more frequent males, have higher BMI, higher waist circumference, and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> compared with non-apneic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hb A1c, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and age were not statistically different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OSA odds increased 1.1 times with every 1-cm increase in abdominal circumference (95%CI: 1.01-1.13) and 1.2 times with every kg/m2 increase in BMI (95%CI: 1.05-1.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations remained statistically significant even after adjustment for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of OSA in the sampled population was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the need for more data regarding prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> in Romanian patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, associations found may form a basis to develop specific recommendations for screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from Romania </plain></SENT>
