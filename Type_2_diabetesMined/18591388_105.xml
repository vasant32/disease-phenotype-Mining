<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Genome-wide association studies have dramatically increased the number of common genetic variants that are robustly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A possible clinical use of this information is to identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease, so that preventative measures may be more effectively targeted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we assess the ability of 18 confirmed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variants to differentiate between type 2 diabetic case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed index single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the 18 independent loci in 2,598 control subjects and 2,309 case subjects from the Genetics of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Audit and Research Tayside Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The discriminatory ability of the combined SNP information was assessed by grouping individuals based on number of risk alleles carried and determining relative odds of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and by calculating the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individuals carrying more risk alleles had a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For example, 1.2% of individuals with &gt;24 risk alleles had an odds ratio of 4.2 (95% CI 2.11-8.56) against the 1.8% with 10-12 risk alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AUC (a measure of discriminative accuracy) for these variants was 0.60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AUC for age, BMI, and sex was 0.78, and adding the genetic risk variants only marginally increased this to 0.80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Currently, common risk variants for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> do not provide strong predictive value at a population level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the joint effect of risk variants identified subgroups of the population at substantially different risk of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to assess whether individuals with extreme numbers of risk alleles may benefit from genetic testing </plain></SENT>
