<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of heritability in their etiology is well recognized, however, the numerous attempts made in order certain genetic variants determining individual susceptibility to be identified have had limited success, until recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At present the advancements in human genetics and the utilization of the genome-wide association approach have led to the identification of over 20 genetic loci associated with, respectively <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the genes identified to date, however, have modest effect on disease risk suggesting that both diseases are unlikely to develop without the individual being exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>- and/or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-promoting environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, unhealthy lifestyle, characterized by physical inactivity and food overconsumption is an unequivocally established risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numerous epidemiological studies and randomized controlled trials, on the other hand, have demonstrated that lifestyle modification is effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, gene-lifestyle interaction studies suggest that genetic susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be partially or totally kept under control by healthy lifestyle or lifestyle modification and that lifestyle determines whether an individual is likely to develop the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inherited factors, however, seem to influence individual response to a lifestyle intervention program and even the motivation for lifestyle change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Personalized interventions according to genotype may be, therefore, considered in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By then lifestyle modification targeting dietary change and increased physical activity may be recommended for successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention irrespectively of genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
