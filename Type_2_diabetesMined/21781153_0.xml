<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Altogether, 10,149 individuals who had high risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in the implementation programme of the national <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programme at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One-year follow-up data were available for 2798 individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was based on self-report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle interventions were individual or groups sessions on lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of lifestyle intervention was measured as changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status and incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Family history was associated with the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention in men, but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 1-year follow-up, body weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and score for 10-year risk for fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (SCORE) decreased and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status improved more in men without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in men with a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the participating men and women, 10% and 5% developed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Family history was not related to the incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in either gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Men without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more successful in responding to lifestyle counselling with regard to cardio-metabolic measurements and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance than those with a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar results were not seen in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In keeping with findings from earlier studies, the prevention of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not influenced by a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
