<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 70 eyes from 70 adult subjects (14 control males, 22 control females, 16 males with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 18 females with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A template-scaling technique was used to obtain first-order P1 implicit times and N1-P1 amplitudes from photopic multifocal electroretinograms within the central 45 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The males with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly more abnormal than their female counterparts in two separate analyses of local neuroretinal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the total number of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> locations with an abnormally delayed implicit time (z score â‰¥ 2) was higher (P &lt; 0.001) in the diabetic males (482 locations = 29.2%) compared to the diabetic females (298 locations = 16.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, in the response topographies that consisted of 103 means of local implicit times for each group, the diabetic males were significantly delayed (P &lt; 0.025) at 23 corresponding positions (22.3%) compared to the diabetic females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time, no corresponding stimulus locations were significantly delayed in the diabetic females compared to the diabetic males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuroretinal function is more abnormal in males than in females for adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, relative to males, females may have some protection from, or resistance to, neurodegenerative changes that precede the development of background <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
