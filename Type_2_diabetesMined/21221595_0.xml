<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relationship with disease control of DM and the presence of FMS was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied 93 consecutive patients with DM (85 with type 2 DM and 8 patients with type 1 DM) followed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single researcher took the history and did physical examination including manual tender point examination according to Manual Tender Point Survey instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the diagnosis of FMS, 1990 American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for FMS was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured patients' fasting blood sugar levels and HbA1c levels around the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded from the study if they had any other serious disease, and if there was any history of drug use that interferes with the symptoms of FMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) were accepted as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FMS was found in 18% of patients with DM type 2 (no patients with FMS in type 1 DM group), in 34% of patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Female patients with DM type 2 had significantly higher FMS rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean fasting blood sugar levels and mean HbA1c levels were not significantly different between type 2 DM patients with FMS and DM patients without FMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In RA group, in RA patients without FMS, the use of steroids was significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We have found an increased prevalence rate of FMS in patients with DM type 2 and RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the prevalence rate of FMS and good DM disease control </plain></SENT>
