<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the relationship between subjective distress and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in 121 first- and second-generation Mexican immigrant women seeking <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care at a safety-net hospital in Chicago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a mixed-methods approach including narrative interview, survey, and finger-stick blood HbA1c data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using grounded theory analysis, we identified seven life stressors from narrative interviews: interpersonal abuse, stress related to health, family, neighborhood violence, immigration status, and work, and feeling socially detached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women reported unusually high rates of interpersonal abuse (65%) and disaggregated physical abuse (54%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282350" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual abuse</z:e> (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D cut-off points of 16 and 24 and assessed rates to be 49 and 34%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that interpersonal abuse was a significant predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CESD ≥ 24) in bivariate (OR 3.97; 95% CI 1.58-10.0) and multivariate (OR 5.51; 95% CI 1.85, 16.4) logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that interpersonal abuse functions as an important contributor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> among low-income Mexican immigrant women and should be recognized and addressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
