<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>Sleep disturbances</z:hpo> are common in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002189'>excessive daytime sleepiness</z:hpo> and increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless leg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to investigate the prevalence and determine the predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0565800" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">sleep dysfunction</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a southeast Asian Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 120 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who attended an endocrinology clinic in a tertiary-care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After we collected their demographic data, we recorded their anthropometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting, postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) values were then obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quality of sleep was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which is a questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a monthlong period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Global Sleep Quality score ≥5 discriminates between good and poor sleepers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean global PSQI score was 7.08 (standard deviation, 3.89), which suggested poor sleep quality in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent of patients had a global PSQI score ≥5, indicating that they were "poor sleepers." The global PSQI score positively correlated with the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and was also independent of other variables such as age, gender, body mass index, HbA1c, or medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0565800" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">sleep dysfunction</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also found a significant correlation between duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and quality of sleep, independent of other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is important for physicians to address the quality and duration of sleep in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
