<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very few studies have found an association between the development and progression of DPN in T2DM and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods:  Using gene-specific primers in a polymerase chain reaction, the presence of ACE I/D polymorphisms was screened for in 276 T2DM patients with DPN, 496 T2DM patients without DPN, and 331 control (non-diabetic) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results:  The distribution of the I/D genotypes was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The II genotype was significantly more prevalent in T2DM patients without DPN than the DD genotype (P &lt; 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of the II and DD genotypes in T2DM patients with DPN (P = 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  The II genotype of the ACE gene has a protective effect against the development of DPN in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests a role for the renin-angiotensin system in modulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in T2DM </plain></SENT>
