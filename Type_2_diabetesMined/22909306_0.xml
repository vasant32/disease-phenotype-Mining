<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in out-patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Bangladesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study a random sample of 483 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> out-patients from three <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics in Bangladesh was invited to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them 417 patients took part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were measured using previously developed and culturally standardized Bengali and Sylheti versions of the World HealthOrganization-5 Well Being Index (WHO-5) and the Patient Health Questionairre-9 (PHQ-9) with predefined cut-off scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data was collected using two different modes; e.g. standard assisted collection and audio questionnaire methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and patient characteristics were explored using regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence depressive symptoms was 34% (PHQ-9 score [GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 5) and 36% (WHO-5 score &lt; 52) with audio questionnaire delivery method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates were similar regardless of the type (PHQ-9 vs. WHO-5) and language (Sylheti vs. Bengali) of the questionnaires, and methods of delivery (standard assisted vs. audio methods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significant predictors of depressive symptoms using either the PHQ-9 or WHO-5 questionnaires were; age, income, gender, treatment intensity, and co-morbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was strongly associated with poor glycaemic control and number of co-morbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> prevalence is common in out-patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Bangladesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a setting where recognition, screening and treatment levels remain low, health care providers need to focus their efforts on diagnosing, referring and effectively treating this important disease in order to improve service delivery </plain></SENT>
