<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that ETs regulate augmented production of extracellular matrix proteins causing structural alterations in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: db/db mice and their age- and sex-matched controls were examined after 2 and 4months of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Groups of diabetic animals were treated with oral macitentan (25mg/kg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were monitored with respect to body weight and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urine analyses were performed for albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac hemodynamic studies were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Renal, cardiac and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> tissues were analyzed for ET-1, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibronectin (FN), extradomain B containing FN (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">EDB</z:chebi>(+)FN) and collagen α-I (IV) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP) and brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Protein expressions were measured by ELISA and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microscopic analyses were performed in the kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Diabetic animals showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, increased urinary albumin and augmented serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> caused increased renal, cardiac and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ET-1, TGF-β1, VEGF, FN, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">EDB</z:chebi>(+)FN, collagen α-I(IV) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression along with increased FN and collagen protein and NF-κB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Diabetic mice also demonstrated mesangial expansion, cardiac dysfunction and increased expression of ANP and BNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment with macitentan attenuated such abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These experiments confirmed that ET system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Such <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induced changes can be reduced macitentan therapy </plain></SENT>
