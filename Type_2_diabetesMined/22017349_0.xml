<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study quantified the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the General Practice Research Database from the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 119,966) and patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 1,794,516) were identified in the General Practice Research Database </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2007, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> incidence was 198 per 100,000 person-years in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with 27 per 100,000 patients-years among patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (crude hazard ratio 8.0, 95% CI 7.4-8.7) </plain></SENT>
