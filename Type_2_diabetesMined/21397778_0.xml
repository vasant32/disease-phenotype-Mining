<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Low rates of treatment modification in patients with insufficiently controlled risk factors are common in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although adherence problems are often mentioned in surveys as a reason for not intensifying treatment, observational studies have shown inconclusive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess how medication adherence affects treatment modifications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cohort study of 11,268 primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were diagnosis before 2007, ≥1 prescription to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulating medication in the preceding 6 months, and a systolic blood pressure level ≥140 mm Hg or glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> ≥7% in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients on maximal treatment were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment modifications as observed from prescriptions were classified as none, dose increase, dose decrease, class switch, class addition, or class discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Refill adherence was assessed as medication possession ratio or length of last gap between refills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We performed multilevel multinomial regression analysis to test for associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 4980 diabetic patients with elevated blood pressure and 2945 diabetic patients with elevated glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower adherence for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> were more likely to have those medications discontinued (odds ratio [OR] for every 10% lower medication possession ratio =1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.33) or the dose decreased (OR = 1.14; CI 1.01-1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulating medication, dose increases (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98) and medication additions (OR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99) were less likely in patients with lower adherence levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low adherence inhibits the intensification of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulating but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication in type 2 diabetic patients with insufficiently controlled risk factors in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adherence problems may lead to diminished or even discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
