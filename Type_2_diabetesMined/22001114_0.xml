<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from a 52-week clinical trial comparing saxagliptin and glipizide in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was used in a simulation model to estimate long term complications in a cohort of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model estimates the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, and ultimately, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with the investigated treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Costs and QALYs were estimated for a lifetime time horizon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with SU+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, the cost per QALY gained with saxagliptin+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is approximately SEK 91,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients on saxagliptin+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> gain 0.10 QALYs on average, at an incremental cost of around SEK 9500 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness results were robust to various sensitivity analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, over a patient's lifetime, the addition of saxagliptin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life years compared with SU in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin treatment is a cost-effective treatment alternative for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients not well-controlled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
