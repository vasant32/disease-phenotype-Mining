<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with chronically elevated systemic levels of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine with a role in skeletal muscle metabolism that signals through the IL-6 receptor (IL-6Rα) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that skeletal muscle in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> develops a resistance to IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By utilizing western blot analysis, we demonstrate that IL-6Rα protein was down regulated in skeletal muscle biopsies from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> persons with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the status of IL-6 signaling in skeletal muscle in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we isolated satellite cells from skeletal muscle of people that were healthy (He), <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (Ob) or were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM), and differentiated them in vitro into myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of IL-6Rα was conserved in Ob myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IL-6 administration for 30, 60 and 120 minutes, resulted in a down-regulation of IL-6Rα protein in Ob myocytes compared to both He myocytes (P&lt;0.05) and DM myocytes (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there was a strong time-dependent regulation of IL-6Rα protein in response to IL-6 (P&lt;0.001) in He myocytes, not present in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessing downstream signaling, DM, but not Ob myocytes demonstrated a trend towards an increased protein phosphorylation of STAT3 in DM myocytes (P = 0.067) accompanied by a reduced SOCS3 protein induction (P&lt;0.05), in response to IL-6 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite this loss of negative control, IL-6 failed to increase AMPKα2 activity and IL-6 mRNA expression in DM myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in fusion capacity of myocytes between cell groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that negative control of IL-6 signaling is increased in myocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, whereas a dysfunctional IL-6 signaling is established further downstream of IL-6Rα in DM myocytes, possibly representing a novel mechanism by which skeletal muscle function is compromised in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
