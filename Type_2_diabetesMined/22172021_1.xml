<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the reliability of standard short-term clinical measurements of heart rate variability in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 24 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (11 male, age 61 ± 9 years), parameters of heart rate variability in the time domain (standard deviation of RR intervals, coefficient of variation of RR intervals and root mean square of successive RR interval differences) and frequency domain (very low frequency, low frequency, high frequency and total spectral power) were derived from a 5-min electrocardiograph recorded during two laboratory visits separated by 16 ± 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute and relative reliability were assessed by 95% limits of random variation and the intraclass correlation coefficient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Categorical agreement of classifications of heart rate variability and sample size estimates for clinical trials were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite no significant difference in mean heart rate variability between tests, 95% limits of random variation indicated that repeated measurements were between 58% higher/37% lower (most reliable parameter; coefficient of variation of RR intervals) and 443% higher/82% lower (least reliable parameter; very low frequency power) than the first measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.58 to 0.90 and sample size requirements from 20 to 93 patients per group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement of categories of heart rate variability ranged from 79 to 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term clinical measurements of heart rate variability in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are characterized by poor absolute reliability, but substantial to good relative reliability, suggesting greater clinical utility in diagnosis than in sequential follow-up </plain></SENT>
