<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the magnitude and variance of the change of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) concentrations, and to identify determinants of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control up to 2 years after gastric bypass (GBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and GLP-1 concentrations were measured during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge before and 1, 12, and 24 months after GBP in 15 severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve from 0 to 180 min (AUC(0-180)) started decreasing in magnitude (P &lt; 0.05) 1 month after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 AUC(0-180) increased in magnitude 1 month after GBP (P &lt; 0.05), with increased variance only after 1 year (P(σ)(2) ≤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 AUC(0-180) was positively associated with insulin AUC(0-180) (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increase in variance of GLP-1 at 1 and 2 years after GBP suggests mechanisms other than proximal gut bypass to explain the enhancement of GLP-1 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between GLP-1 and insulin concentrations supports the idea that the incretins are involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control after GBP </plain></SENT>
