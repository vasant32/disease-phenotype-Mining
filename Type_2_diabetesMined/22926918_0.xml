<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected over a 24-month period from patients requiring insulin initiation as part of usual care, in a prospective, observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in insulin regimens and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) were examined within countries (Germany, Greece, Spain) and overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prandial insulin only was most commonly initiated in Germany, while basal or premixed formulations were initiated in Greece and Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Germany, compared with Greece or Spain, the patients were slightly younger and had a shorter <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration when initiating insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients overall, 76.1% did not change their insulin regimen between initiation and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most obvious change was a shift from prandial to basal/bolus in Germany, with almost doubling of mean daily insulin dose; in Greece and Spain, more patients stopped using insulin and the trend to more complex regimens was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, mean (SD) HbA(1c) decreased from baseline (9.4 [1.7]%) to 6 months (7.2 [1.0]%), but with little further change through 24 months (7.2 [1.1]%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) change with basal/bolus insulin (-2.6 [2.0]%, baseline 10.1%) was greater than with basal only (-2.0 [1.8]%, baseline 9.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA(1c) less than 7% was achieved and maintained over 24 months in Germany, but was not achieved at any time in Greece or Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within 24 months of insulin initiation, the majority of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remained on the same insulin regimen initially instigated, despite the well-established progressive loss of prandial and basal endogenous insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adequate glycemic control was best achieved where insulin dosage adjustments and insulin intensification took place </plain></SENT>
