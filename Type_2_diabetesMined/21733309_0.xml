<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies of individual whole grains on the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of different whole grains on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the Goto-Kakisaki (GK) rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GK rats were fed either a basal diet or a whole grain-containing diet for 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole grain diets contained 65 % whole grain flours of wheat, barley, oats or maize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 months of feeding, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were lower in the wheat, barley and oats groups, compared with the basal group, whereas glycated Hb was significantly greater in the wheat group compared with other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Feeding of whole barley and maize increased plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations compared with whole wheat at 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend in the improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with a consumption of barley and oats diets at 2 months (P = 0·06) compared with the basal diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> markers, urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi>-reactive substances and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi>, did not improve with whole grain intake at 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 5 months, whole grain diets did not differ from the basal diet in glycaemic control, insulin secretion, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and preservation of pancreatic β-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the consumption of whole grains may offer modest benefit early in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but this benefit is lost with further development of the disease </plain></SENT>
