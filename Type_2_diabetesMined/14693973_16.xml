<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A primary objective of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management is to improve glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of implementing intensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case management in disparate populations remains largely untested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical sites in three southern California counties serving low-income, ethnic minority populations participated in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We randomized 362 Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California) recipients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for at least 1 year to intervention (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case management) or control (traditional primary care treatment) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five percent of participants were minorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with HbA(1c) levels less than 7.5%, serious <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications, or other serious medical conditions were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of the intervention (ongoing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case management added to primary care) on glycemic control using serial HbA(1c) measurements over several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 25.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) decreased substantially in both groups from an average of 9.54-7.66% (a reduction of 1.88%) in the intervention group and from an average of 9.66-8.53% (a reduction of 1.13%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This improvement was sustained throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reduction in HbA(1c) was consistently greater in the intervention group at each time point (P &lt; 0.001), ranging between 0.65 at 6 months and 0.87 at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> case management, added to primary care, substantially improved glycemic control compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> case management can help reduce disparities in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> health status among low-income ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
