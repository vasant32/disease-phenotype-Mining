<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: Gingival tissue samples were obtained from 12 adult patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 10 healthy adults, as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specimens were examined using standard dyes as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and Eosin and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-Alcian stain, by a microscope with different magnifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Our results showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is characterized by significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, affecting both epithelial and connective tissues, with degeneration of dermal papilla, increase in number of inflammatory cells, destruction of reticular fibers and accumulation of dense collagen fibers (<z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Within the limits of this study, diabetic subjects presented distortion in periodontal attachment, with changes in both epithelial and connective tissues, when compared to the healthy controls, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> has an independent effect on periodontal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect is observed in both groups, so that we considered it to be independent of the periodontal condition </plain></SENT>
