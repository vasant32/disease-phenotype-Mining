<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Altogether 4169 employees were invited for a health check-up and 2312 participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The check-up included physical examinations, questionnaires on working hours, sleep, and lifestyle, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk score FINDRISC, and blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle counselling was offered for those with increased T2D risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether 15% of participants had a high T2D risk (FINDRISCâ‰¥15 and/or elevated, but non-diabetic blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), and a further 15% had a moderate T2D risk (FINDRISC 10-14 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those 60% agreed to attend lifestyle counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic syndrome</z:e> was more common, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile more unfavorable and hsCRP higher by increasing FINDRISC score category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factor profiles linked to shift work status were not self-evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The renewed health check-up process effectively identified those employees with increased T2D and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk who would benefit from lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of FINDRISC questionnaire was a feasible first-step screening method in occupational health care setting </plain></SENT>
