<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the effects of frequency of follow-up on clinical indicators as well as QoL of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects and Methods: In total, 155 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were randomly assigned to two groups, which only differed in the frequency of follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both therapy groups, the patients were taking oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QoL was measured with a QoL Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> (DMQLS) at study entry and months 3, 6, 9, and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the drugs used, the patients were divided in three medication groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that compared with the conventional therapy group, the intensive therapy group showed significant improvement in the Disease, Psychology, and Satisfaction domain scores of the DMQLS, the overall DMQLS score, and clinical indicator values (fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2-h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation analyses showed that the changes in Disease, <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp>, Psychology, and Satisfaction domain scores of the DMQLS and in the overall DMQLS score were negatively correlated with changes in clinical indicator values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Intensive frequency of follow-up is associated with improved QOL and clinical indicators and thus may be a preferred approach for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients on oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As QoL is negatively correlated with clinical indicators, it could be used as a comprehensive indicator of therapeutic effects on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
