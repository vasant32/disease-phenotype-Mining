<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous adipose-tissue-derived factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, numerous pharmacological interventions are available to lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beside more or less comparable <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering efficacy, some of them have shown limited or probably even unfavorable effects on the cardiovascular system and overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, incretin-based therapies (GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and DPP-IV inhibitors) have been introduced in the treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beside the effects of GLP-1 on insulin secretion, glucagon secretion, and gastrointestinal motility, recent studies suggested a couple of direct cardiovascular effects of GLP-1-based therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The goal of this paper is to provide an overview about the current knowledge of direct GLP-1 effects on endothelial and vascular function and potential consequences on the cardiovascular outcome in patients with T2DM treated with GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> or DPP-IV inhibitors </plain></SENT>
