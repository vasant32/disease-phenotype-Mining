<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of broccoli sprouts powder (BSP) containing high concentration of sulphoraphane on IR in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 g/d BSP (A, n = 27), 5 g/d BSP (B, n = 29) and placebo (C, n = 25) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentration, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to insulin ratio and homoeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index were measured at baseline and again 4 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients completed the study and 63 were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, consumption of 10 g/d BSP resulted in a significant decrease in serum insulin concentration and HOMA-IR (p = 0.05 for treatment effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, broccoli sprouts may improve IR in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
