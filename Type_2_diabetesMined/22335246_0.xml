<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were derived from healthcare claims for individuals with employer-sponsored Medicare supplemental insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study period consisted of two consecutive 1-year periods; the baseline period (1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009) and the evaluation period (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients selected for study were at least 65 years of age with evidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the baseline period, as identified using a Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set algorithm or by at least two prescription claims for oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The baseline period was used to collect information on the patients' demographics and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evaluation period was used to identify the presence of hypoglycaemic events and fall-related fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was employed to examine the association between hypoglycaemic events and fall-related fractures occurring during the evaluation period, adjusting for patients' demographics and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 361 210 included patients, 16 936 had hypoglycaemic events during the evaluation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with hypoglycaemic events had 70% higher regression-adjusted odds (hypoglycaemic events odds ratio = 1.70; 95% confidence interval = 1.58-1.83) of fall-related fractures than patients without hypoglycaemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple sensitivity analyses also yielded results suggesting increased odds of fall-related fractures in patients with hypoglycaemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM-coded outpatient hypoglycaemic events were independently associated with an increased risk of fall-related fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and the risk of fall-related fractures are warranted </plain></SENT>
