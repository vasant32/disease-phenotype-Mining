<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the relations between genetic variation at the adiponectin-encoding gene, ADIPOQ, and adiponectin levels, and subsequently its role in disease, we conducted a deep resequencing experiment of ADIPOQ in 14,002 subjects, including 12,514 Europeans, 594 African Americans, and 567 Indian Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 296 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 30 amino acid changes, and carried out association analyses in a subset of 3,665 subjects from two independent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We confirmed multiple genome-wide association study findings and identified a novel association between a low-frequency SNP (rs17366653) and adiponectin levels (P = 2.2E-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that seven SNPs exert independent effects on adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together, they explained 6% of adiponectin variation in our samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We subsequently assessed association between these SNPs and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Genetics of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>-DARTS) study, comprised of 5,145 case and 6,374 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No evidence of association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found, but we were also unable to exclude the possibility of substantial effects (e.g., odds ratio 95% CI for rs7366653 [0.91-1.58]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigation by large-scale and well-powered Mendelian randomization studies is warranted </plain></SENT>
