<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence is now emerging that the PPARβ/δ isotype is a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: In this review, the capacity of PPARβ/δ to prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special emphasis is placed on preclinical studies and the molecular mechanisms responsible for its actions in the main cell types involved in these pathologies: adipocytes, β-cells, skeletal muscle cells and hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: While several concerns remain for the development of PPARβ/δ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, these drugs have demonstrated their efficacy in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in preclinical studies, as well as in a few short clinical studies in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although this data is promising, additional studies must be performed to confirm the efficacy and safety of these drugs in the treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
