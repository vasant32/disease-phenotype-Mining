<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to further explore the effects of resistant <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> on insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve overweight (BMI 28.2Â±0.4 kg/m(2)) individuals participated in this randomized, subject-blind crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants consumed either 40 g type 2 resistant <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> or the energy and carbohydrate-matched placebo daily for four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the effect on insulin secretion was made at the end of each intervention using an insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIVGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly higher during the FSIVGTT following the resistant <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> compared with the placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modelling of the data showed significantly improved first-phase insulin secretion with resistant <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects were observed without any changes to either body weight or habitual food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study showed that just four weeks of resistant <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> intake significantly increased the first-phase insulin secretion in individuals at risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies exploring this effect in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are required </plain></SENT>
