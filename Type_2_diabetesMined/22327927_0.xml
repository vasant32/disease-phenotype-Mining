<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the prevalence of newly diagnosed subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> in a cohort of patients with T2D, and also to analyse the relationships between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related characteristics and the presence of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>933 diabetic patients without previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> (45.4% females, mean age 66.3 years, median duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 10 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sample of 911 non-diabetic subjects without known thyroid dysfunction was studied as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of thyrotropin were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> was present in 4.3% of female and 3.5% of male diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risk was significant only for the female gender (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.56-8.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with diabetic patients without thyroid hyperfunction, patients with subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> were older, had longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, showed lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, had greater proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goitre</z:hpo> and diet therapy, and had lower proportion of treatment with oral agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that age and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goitre</z:hpo> were significantly related to subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> in patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk for subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> is increased in women with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Advanced age and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goitre</z:hpo> are significantly and independently related with the presence of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> in diabetic population </plain></SENT>
