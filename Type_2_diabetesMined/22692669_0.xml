<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the improvement in clinical indicators associated with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in patients with non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LRYGB was performed in 30 T2DM patients with a BMI &lt;35 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative changes in BMI, waist circumference, and biochemical indicators including fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reduction in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> from 8.02 ± 1.77 to 5.59 ± 1.02 % (p &lt; 0.05) at 12 months was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was completely resolved in nine cases, resulting in discontinuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant surgical complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LRYGB is beneficial for non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> T2DM patients in China </plain></SENT>
