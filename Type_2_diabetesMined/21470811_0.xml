<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the renal oxygenation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by blood oxygenation level dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 67 healthy controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were further divided into four subgroups based on renal functional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral renal cortical R2* (CR2*) and medullary R2* (MR2*) values were extracted and quantified on BOLD-MRI, then R2* ratio between medulla and cortex (MCR) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CR2*, MR2* and MCR were compared among the groups separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationships were analyzed between R2* values and clinical index of renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, MR2* and CR2* in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive relationship was found between MR2* and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CR2* was negatively correlated with eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the MCR increased in early stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and decreased along with the aggravation of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BOLD-MRI can non-invasively detect and assess the renal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in medulla is more apparent and earlier than in cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the progression of DN, a reversion of corticomedullary oxygenation gradient can be detected, thus, MCR would be adopted to suppose the progression and prognosis of DN </plain></SENT>
