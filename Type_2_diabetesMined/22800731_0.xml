<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OOJ was administered orally in doses of 225 and 450Â mg/kg body weight to high-fat diet and low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic rats for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that OOJ treatment could increase body weight, decrease organ relative weights of liver and kidney, reduce fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, improve oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, increased <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content in liver and skeletal muscle, reduced urinary protein excretion, higher hepatic GCK enzyme activity, lower hepatic PEPCK enzyme activity, enhanced GLP-1 level, decreased glucagon level and alleviated histopathological changes of pancrea occurred in OOJ-treated diabetic rats by comparison with untreated diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, that OOJ exerts remarkable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect in experimental type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, thus justifying its traditional usage </plain></SENT>
