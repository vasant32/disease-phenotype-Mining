<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is rapidly increasing, prevention of the disease should be considered as a crucial objective in the near future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may contribute to the prevention of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine if ARBs as monotherapy or combination therapy may experience a decreased incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and prevent cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Relevant experimental and clinical studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (1969 to May 30, 2011) to extract a consensus of trial data involving the effect of ARBs on prevention of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials versus placebo/routine therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A random-effects model was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven trials were identified, including 82 738 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ARBs prevented new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 0.8 (95%CI 0.76, 0.85)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regardless of indication for use, essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (seven trials), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (one trial), cardiocerebrovascular disease (two trials) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (one trial), reductions in new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were maintained (0.75 (0.69, 0.82), 0.85 (0.78, 0.92), 0.80 (0.76, 0.85) and 0.80 (0.64, 0.99), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No statistical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed for any evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, ARBs did not significantly reduce the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> versus control therapy among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But ARBs did reduce the odds of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> study versus control therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ARBs have significant ability to reduce risk of developing new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but does not improve cardiovascular outcomes over the study follow-up periods among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of included studies </plain></SENT>
