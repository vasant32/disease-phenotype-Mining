<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, it appears, our understanding of the disease has not changed much, aside from the replacement of tasting the patients' urine by the measurement of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (HbA1c) for its diagnosis and the discovery of some new drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Already, in those old days a physician from India named Sushrut described <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> as a disease characterised by the passage of large amounts of urine and its "honey-like" taste and, noteworthy, as a disease that is mainly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and a sedentary lifestyle, recommending physical activity as the primary treatment option </plain></SENT>
