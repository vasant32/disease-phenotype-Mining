<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that empowerment is an important factor to address everyday aspects of dealing with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> empowerment on medication adherence and self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data on 378 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recruited from two primary care clinics in the southeastern United States were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously validated scales were used to measure <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> empowerment, medication adherence, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors (including diet, physical activity, blood sugar testing, and foot care) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was used to assess the independent effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> empowerment on medication adherence and self-care behaviors controlling for relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-three percent were non-Hispanic blacks, 69% were women, 22% were 65 years or older, 68% were not married, 26% had less than high school education, 60% were unemployed, 39% were uninsured, and 47% had a yearly income &lt;$10,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Empowerment had significant correlations with medication adherence (r=0.17, P&lt;0.003), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge (r=0.16, P=0.007), diet (r=0.24, P&lt;0.001), exercise (r=0.25, P&lt;0.001), blood sugar testing (r=0.12, P=0.043), and foot care (r=0.18, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the regression model, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> empowerment was significantly associated with medication adherence (β=-0.04, P=0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge (β=0.09, P=0.012), diet (β=0.09, P&lt;0.001), exercise (β=0.10, P&lt;0.001), blood sugar testing (β=0.07, P=0.016), and foot care (β=0.08, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> empowerment was related to better <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge, medication adherence and improved self-care behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emphasis on empowerment and self-efficacy is relevant to improve outcomes in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
