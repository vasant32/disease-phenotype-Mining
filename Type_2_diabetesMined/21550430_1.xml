<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, the absence of osteocalcin leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in mice, while genetically modified mice with an increase in uncarboxylated osteocalcin are protected from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested in the mouse the therapeutic potential of intermittent administration of osteocalcin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that daily injections of osteocalcin at either 3 or 30 ng/g/day significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> and insulin sensitivity in mice fed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was attributable, in part, to an increase in both Î²-cell mass and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), daily injections of osteocalcin partially restored insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mice treated with intermittent osteocalcin injections displayed additional mitochondria in their skeletal muscle, had <z:mp ids='MP_0004889'>increased energy expenditure</z:mp> and were protected from diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> induced by the HFD was completely rescued in mice receiving osteocalcin daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results provide evidence that daily injections of osteocalcin can improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> handling and prevent the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
