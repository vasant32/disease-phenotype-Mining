<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a considerable uncertainty with respect to the appropriate choice of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> pharmacotherapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and comorbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about comorbidity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> rates and selected pharmacotherapy in diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DiaRegis is a prospective registry in Germany including 3,810 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment with oral mono or oral dual combination therapy in 2009/2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients for which adjustment of pharmacotherapy (including the introduction of insulin and GLP-1 analogues) was deemed necessary were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the differences in comorbidity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and choice of anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy between diabetics with and without clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in clinical practice in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For 3,746 patients, data on the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were available, median (IQR) age 65.9 (57.6-72.8) years and 46.8% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (n = 370; 9.9%) were older, had a higher BMI, were less physically active, and had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and a substantial comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control was comparable between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 76.8% received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, 32.7% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, 2.2% glucosidase inhibitors, 4.3% glinides, 6.2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">glitazones</z:chebi> and 7.3% DPP-4 inhibitors at baseline before adjustment of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> received less <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-0.79) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.52-0.95) but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (OR 1.22, 95%CI 0.82-1.81) or other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> was considerably more frequent in diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> than in those without (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.47-2.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> had a substantially increased comorbidity burden compared to patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They more often suffered from episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, especially those requiring medical assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> did not impact the choice of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> pharmacotherapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no differential use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> despite evidence discouraging their use in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
