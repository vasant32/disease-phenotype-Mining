<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adults with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> often have limitations in mobility that increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An intensive lifestyle intervention that produces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improves fitness could slow the loss of mobility in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomly assigned 5145 overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adults between the ages of 45 and 74 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to either an intensive lifestyle intervention or a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> support-and-education program; 5016 participants contributed data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used hidden Markov models to characterize disability states and mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression to estimate the probability of functional decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was self-reported limitation in mobility, with annual assessments for 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At year 4, among 2514 adults in the lifestyle-intervention group, 517 (20.6%) had severe disability and 969 (38.5%) had good mobility; the numbers among 2502 participants in the support group were 656 (26.2%) and 798 (31.9%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lifestyle-intervention group had a relative reduction of 48% in the risk of loss of mobility, as compared with the support group (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.63; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improved fitness (as assessed on treadmill testing) were significant mediators of this effect (P&lt;0.001 for both variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events that were related to the lifestyle intervention included a slightly higher frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms at year 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> and improved fitness slowed the decline in mobility in overweight adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
