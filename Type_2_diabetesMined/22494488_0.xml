<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increasing, the effect of this traditional diet pattern on glycemic response has not been studied fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the glycemic response of bean and rice traditional meals compared to rice alone in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 14) or diet/exercise (n = 3) aged 35-70 years participated in the randomized 4 x 4 crossover trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The white long grain rice control, pinto beans/rice, black beans/rice, red kidney beans/rice test meals, matched for 50 grams of available carbohydrate, were consumed at breakfast after a 12 hour fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations at baseline and at 30 minute intervals up to 180 minutes postprandial were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MANOVA for repeated measures established <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> differences between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paired t tests identified differences between bean types and the rice control following a significant MANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postprandial net <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were significantly lower for the three bean/rice treatments in contrast to the rice control at 90, 120 and 150 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incremental area under the curve values were significantly lower for the pinto and black bean/rice meals compared to rice alone, but not for kidney beans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pinto, dark red kidney and black beans with rice attenuate the glycemic response compared to rice alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Promotion of traditional foods may provide non-pharmaceutical management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and improve dietary adherence with cultural groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Trial registration Clinical Trials number NCT01241253 </plain></SENT>
