<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal region and the mid-diaphysis of the femur using dual energy X-ray absorption (DXA), the blood osteocalcin level and the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level every five weeks from 8 to 23 weeks old in KK-Ay diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BMD of the proximal region after 18 weeks old was significantly lower when compared with that at 8 weeks old (p&lt;0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in the BMD of the mid-diaphysis at each week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BMD of the proximal region at 18 weeks old was significantly lower than that in ddY mice, used as controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood osteocalcin level at 18 weeks old was significantly lower than that at 8 weeks old and that in 18-week-old ddY mice (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was significant negative correlation between the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and the BMD of the proximal region (r=-0.64, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exerts an influence only on spongy bone, not on cortical bone, and that the BMD in the proximal region of the femur seems to be affected by blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, parallel with the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, through the blood osteocalcin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show the characteristics of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> in KK-Ay mice, an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
