<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the cross-sectional design of most studies does not allow causal inferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is the exploration of this possible association in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in a longitudinal fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This prospective observational study was conducted on a consecutive series of 250 type 2 diabetic outpatients and a 1-year follow-up period was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At enrollment, a complete medical history was collected and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General psychopathology was assessed using the Symptom Checklist 90-revised and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013473" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Eating Disorder</z:e> Examination Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 187 patients available at follow-up, factors associated with unsatisfactory glycemic control at follow-up were baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, insulin therapy, a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, higher scores on the Eating behavior, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149779" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Somatization</z:e> scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis, the attainment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c ≤7 % was associated with baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (p = 0.01), insulin therapy (p = 0.016), and Eating behavior (p = 0.02), whereas duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149779" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Somatization</z:e> were no longer significant after adjusting for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest that clinical features have a much greater impact on attainment of therapeutic goals than psychopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there are several aspects, such as temperament, motivation, self-efficacy, and well-being, not assessed in the present study, which could be crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These areas should be adequately explored for obtaining an overall picture of the psychological determinants of appropriate metabolic control in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
