<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arteries were from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients with sigmoid or rectum <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> for whom surgery was the first option and who were not exposed to neo-adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Segments of human inferior mesenteric arteries from non-diabetic (61.1 ± 8.9 years old, 7 males and 5 females, N = 12) and type 2 diabetic patients (65.8 ± 6.2 years old, 8 males and 4 females, N = 12) were used to determine NOx concentrations and the kinetic parameters of MAO-A, MAO-B and SSAO by the Griess reaction and by radiochemical assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NOx concentrations in arteries from diabetic patients did not differ significantly from those of the non-diabetic group (10.28 ± 4.61 vs 10.71 ± 4.32 nmol/mg protein, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the non-diabetic group, there was a positive correlation between NOx concentrations and MAO-B parameters: Km (r = 0.612, P = 0.034) and Vmax (r = 0.593, P = 0.042), and a negative correlation with the SSAO parameters: Km (r = -0.625, P = 0.029) and Vmax (r = -0.754, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the diabetic group no correlation was found between NOx concentrations and the three kinetic parameters of the enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an important function of sympathetic nerves and vascular NOx concentrations in arteries of non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results confirm the importance of a balance between oxidants and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
