<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We employed a Mendelian randomization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) approach using TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 as an instrument for lifelong levels of β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We first conducted two sets of meta-analyses to quantify the association of the TCF7L2 variant with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among 55 436 cases and 106 020 controls from 66 studies by calculating pooled odds ratio (OR) and to quantify the associations with multiple direct or indirect measures of β-cell function among 35 052 non-diabetic individuals from 31 studies by calculating pooled mean difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further applied the method of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> to obtain the causal estimates for the effect of β-cell function on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk based on findings from the meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OR [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for each five unit increment in homeostasis model assessment of insulin secretion (HOMA-%B) (P = 3.0 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, for measures based on intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, ORs (95% CI) associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk were 0.24 (0.08-0.74) (P = 0.01) and 0.14 (0.04-0.48) (P = 0.002) for per 1 standard deviation increment in insulin sensitivity index and disposition index, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings from the present study lend support to a causal role of pancreatic β-cell function itself in the etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
