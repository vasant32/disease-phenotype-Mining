<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVETo compare ultra-long acting insulin degludec with glargine for efficacy and safety in insulin-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn this 1-year, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, treat-to-target trial, adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with A1C of 7-10% taking OADs were randomized 3:1 to receive once daily degludec or glargine, both with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin was titrated to achieve prebreakfast plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) of 3.9-4.9 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was confirmation of noninferiority of degludec to glargine in A1C reduction after 52 weeks in an intent-to-treat analysis.RESULTSIn <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 1,030 participants (mean age 59 years; baseline A1C 8.2%) were randomized (degludec 773, glargine 257) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction in A1C with degludec was similar (noninferior) to that with glargine (1.06 vs. 1.19%), with an estimated treatment difference of degludec to glargine of 0.09% (95% CI -0.04 to 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall rates of confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (PG &lt;3.1 mmol/L or severe episodes requiring assistance) were similar, with degludec and glargine at 1.52 versus 1.85 episodes/patient-year of exposure (PYE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were few episodes of nocturnal confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in the overall population, and these occurred at a lower rate with degludec versus glargine (0.25 vs. 0.39 episodes/PYE; P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar percentages of patients in both groups achieved A1C levels &lt;7% without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>End-of-trial mean daily insulin doses were 0.59 and 0.60 units/kg for degludec and glargine, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse event rates were similar.CONCLUSIONInsulins degludec and glargine administered once daily in combination with OADs provided similar long-term glycemic control in insulin-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with lower rates of nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> with degludec </plain></SENT>
