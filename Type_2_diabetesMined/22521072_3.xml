<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Basal insulin therapy does not stop loss of β-cell function, which is the hallmark of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and thus <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control inevitably deteriorates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin degludec is a new, ultra-longacting basal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 52 week, phase 3, open-label, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial, undertaken at 123 sites in 12 countries, we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and a glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) of 7·0-10·0% after 3 months or more of any insulin regimen (with or without oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We randomly allocated eligible participants in a 3:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous insulin degludec or glargine, stratified by previous insulin regimen, via a central interactive response system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal insulin was titrated to a target plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration of 3·9-&lt;5·0 mmol/L self-measured before breakfast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was non-inferiority of degludec to glargine measured by change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 52 (non-inferiority limit of 0·4%) by ANOVA in the full analysis set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assessed rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00972283 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 744 (99%) of 755 participants randomly allocated degludec and 248 (99%) of 251 allocated glargine were included in the full analysis set (mean age 58·9 years [SD 9·3], <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 13·5 years [7·3], HbA(1c) 8·3% [0·8], and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 9·2 mmol/L [3·1]); 618 (82%) and 211 (84%) participants completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, HbA(1c) decreased by 1·1% in the degludec group and 1·2% in the glargine group (estimated treatment difference [degludec-glargine] 0·08%, 95% CI -0·05 to 0·21), confirming non-inferiority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rates of overall confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;3·1 mmol/L or severe episodes requiring assistance) were lower with degludec than glargine (11·1 vs 13·6 episodes per patient-year of exposure; estimated rate ratio 0·82, 95% CI 0·69 to 0·99; p=0·0359), as were rates of nocturnal confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (1·4 vs 1·8 episodes per patient-year of exposure; 0·75, 0·58 to 0·99; p=0·0399) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rates of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> seemed similar (0·06 vs 0·05 episodes per patient-year of exposure for degludec and glargine) but were too low for assessment of differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rates of other adverse events did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: A policy of suboptimum <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control to reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and its consequences in advanced type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> might be unwarranted with newer basal insulins such as degludec, which are associated with lower risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
