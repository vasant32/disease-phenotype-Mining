<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 658 second- and third-generation Japanese-Americans (349 men and 309 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different arm length (total, upper and forearm length) and leg length (total and lower leg length) measurements were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined by the use of hypoglycaemic medication, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) ≥ 7 mmol/l or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 2 h ≥ 11.1 mmol/l during an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persons meeting the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> were excluded from these analyses (FPG &lt;7 mmol/l and 2 h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during an OGGT &lt;11.1 but ≥ 7.8 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and limb length while adjusting for possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 145 individuals had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, arm and leg length were not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, computed tomography-measured intra-abdominal fat area, height, weight, smoking status and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, total arm length and upper arm length were inversely related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR for a 1 SD increase 0.49, 95% CI 0.29, 0.84 for total arm length, and OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36, 0.87 for upper arm length) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forearm length, height and leg length were not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings of associations between arm lengths and prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> supports a role for factors that determine bone growth or their correlates in the development of this condition </plain></SENT>
