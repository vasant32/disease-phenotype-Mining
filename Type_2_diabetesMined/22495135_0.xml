<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Factors associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are unclear in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the independent correlates of carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and plaques in these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we measured carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> at three sites (common carotid, bifurcation and internal carotid artery) and the severity of extracranial carotid artery (ECCA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by plaque score in 441 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nontraditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> [ambulatory blood pressures (BPs), aortic stiffness, C-reactive protein and ankle-brachial index) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear and logistic regressions assessed the independent correlates of carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and ECCA plaque score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with greater carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> or plaque scores had worse clinical and laboratory profile than those with lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and plaque scores, including higher BPs, aortic stiffness and prevalences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and plaques were mainly associated with older age, male sex, current-past smoking and ambulatory BPs, but not with clinic BPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Night-time pulse pressure was the most important modifiable determinant of increased carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No microvascular complication was independently associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, except <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> for plaque score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, internal carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and plaque score were associated with ankle-brachial index in the subgroup of patients without macrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In type 2 diabetic patients, older age, male sex, smoking status and ambulatory BPs, particularly night-time pulse pressure, were the main independent correlates of ultrasonographic carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding reinforces the importance of ambulatory BP monitoring in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
