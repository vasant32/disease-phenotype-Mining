<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN/METHODS: The study was conducted on 60 diabetic patients comparing with 30 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular AFT and VPT were assessed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among cardiovascular AFT, E:I ratio [1.24 (1.2-1.32) vs 1.3 (1.24-1.4), p=0.001], and Valsalva ratio [1.28 (1.22-1.4) vs 1.6 (1.5-1.73), p=0.001], the indicators of parasympathetic reactivity were reduced in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rise in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> during handgrip, an indicator of sympathetic reactivity was lower in T2DM [12 (10-14) vs 16 (14-18) mmHg, p=0.001] whereas, fall in SBP during head up tilt [4 (4-8) vs 5 (4-8) mmHg] was comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VPT (somatic sensation) was comparable between T2DM and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Autonomic involvement is more marked than somatic, and parasympathetic involvement is more marked than the sympathetic, possibly reflecting severity and chronological pattern of their involvement </plain></SENT>
