<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin levels are elevated in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the relationship between proinsulin, insulin dose-adjusted <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (IDAA1C), glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1), glucagon, and remission status the first year after diagnosis of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Juvenile patients (n = 275) were followed 1, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At each visit, partial remission was defined as IDAA1C â‰¤ 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients had a liquid meal test at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month visits, which included measurement of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, proinsulin, GLP-1, glucagon, and insulin antibodies (IA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in remission at 6 and 12 months had significantly higher levels of proinsulin compared to non-remitting patients (p &lt; 0.0001, p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An inverse association between proinsulin and IDAA1C was found at 1 and 6 months (p = 0.0008, p = 0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin was positively associated with C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.0001) and IA (p = 0.0024, p = 0.0068, p &lt; 0.0001) at 1, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glucagon (p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.02) as well as GLP-1 (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.002) were significantly lower in remitters than in non-remitters at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin associated positively with GLP-1 at 1 month (p = 0.004) and negatively at 6 (p = 0.002) and 12 months (p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, patients in partial remission have higher levels of proinsulin together with lower levels of GLP-1 and glucagon compared to patients not in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> proinsulin level may be a sign of better residual beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
