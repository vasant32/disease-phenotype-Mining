<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods:  After a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> titration/stabilization period and a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 395 Chinese patients with T2DM aged 25-77 years (baseline HbA1c 8.5%) were randomized (1:1) to double-blind placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg q.d. added to ongoing open-label <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1000 or 1700 mg/day) for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results:  Significant (P &lt; 0.001) changes from baseline in HbA1c (-0.9%), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.2 mmol/L), and 2-h post-meal plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.9 mmol/L) were seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and placebo in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or gastrointestinal adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A small decrease from baseline body weight was observed in the placebo group compared with no change in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group (between-group difference 0.5 kg; P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy significantly improved glycemic control and was generally well tolerated in Chinese patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
