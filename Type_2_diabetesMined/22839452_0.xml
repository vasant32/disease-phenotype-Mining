<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study was carried out in the Nan-Hu district of Jiaxing city, Zhejiang province, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases among type 2 diabetic patients from January 2002 to June 2008 was identified through record-linkage of the Diabetic Surveillance and Registry Database with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and its 95% CI (confidence interval) were used to estimate the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 1083.6 x 105 in male T2DM patients and 870.2 x 105 in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was found in both male and female T2DM patients with an SIR of 1.331 (95% CI=1.143-1.518) and 1.737 (95% CI=1.478-1.997), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> subtypes, both male and female T2DM patients had a significantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> with the SIRs of 2.973 (95% CI=1.731-4.21.) and 2.687 (1.445-3.928), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated risk of liver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740457" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">kidney cancers</z:e> was only found in male T2DM patients with SIRs of 1.538 (1.005-2.072) and 4.091 (1.418-6.764), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (SIR: 2.209 [1.487-2.93]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (SIR: 4.167 [1.584- 6.749]) was found in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These finding indicated that patients with T2DM have an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening should be employed in the management of patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
