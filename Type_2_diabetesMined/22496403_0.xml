<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between osteoprotegerin (OPG), inflammatory markers and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> remains to be elucidated.Methods: We recruited 45 type 2 diabetic patients and 33 healthy controls and assessed them for silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> (SMI) by myocardial perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient blood was tested for OPG, IL-6 and leptin concentrations.Results: OPG, leptin and IL-6 levels were found significantly elevated in diabetic patients (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on our classification of presence/absence of SMI in our diabetic group, we found that there was a significant association between SMI and the biomarkers IL-6 (p &lt; 0.001), leptin (p &lt; 0.001) and OPG (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analyses, OPG was found to be significantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and to SMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, sex and smoking increased the association between OPG and SMI.Conclusion: High OPG, leptin and IL-6 levels are associated with the presence and severity of SMI in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
