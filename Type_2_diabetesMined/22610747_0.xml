<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have reached epidemic levels and account for a substantial portion of the annual health expenditures of developed nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While there is an abundance of epidemiological evidence demonstrating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is a primary risk factor for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the mechanism(s) underlying this linkage are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the enormous impact of these disorders on global health, considerable research effort has been devoted to elucidate the pathophysiological relationship between these two disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two factors believed to contribute to the causal link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and altered secretion of adipose-derived signaling molecules (adipokines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent lines of investigation have implicated the novel adipokine chemerin as a regulator of adipogenesis, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism through interactions with the cognate cell surface receptor chemokine-like receptor 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of chemerin that occur with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are hypothesized to be a causal factor in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a consequence of dysregulation of the key physiological processes regulated by this adipokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes current research on the biological roles of chemerin and chemokine-like receptor 1, and highlights key questions to guide future research on the role of this adipokine in mediating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
