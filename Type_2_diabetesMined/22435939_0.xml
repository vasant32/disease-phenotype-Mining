<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to clarify the correlation between the PFC energy ratio and metabolic parameters including glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in Japanese elderly patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> aged 65 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were 1173 diabetic patients aged 65 years or older with serum HbA1c level of &gt;/=7.4% enrolled in the Japanese Elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Trial (J-EDIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The participants were divided into four groups by the percentage of total energy intake (%E) of carbohydrate (C1: less than 55%E, C2: 55%E or more and less than 60%E, C3: 60%E or more and less than 65%E, and C4: 65%E or more) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relations of %E of carbohydrate to HbA1c and other metabolic parameters, energy intake and nutritional intake were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the subjects were divided into four categories by HbA1c levels by quartile method (Q1: less than 7.90%, Q2: 7.90% or more and less than 8.30%, Q3: 8.30% or more and less than 8.80%, Q4: 8.80% or more) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relations of HbA1c to other metabolic parameters, energy intake and nutritional intake were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean HbA1c levels in the four groups were C1: 8.40%, C2: 8.50%, C3: 8.41% and C4: 8.36% in men, and C1: 8.51%, C2: 8.47%, C3: 8.35% and C4: 8.52% in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences and linear trend in HbA1c levels across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were in the range of 122-128 mg/dL in men from C1 to C3, although it was significantly higher in C4 (177 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were in the range of 128-136 mg/dL in women from C1 to C3, although it was significantly higher in Q4 (150 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Amounts of protein and fat intakes decreased with an increase of %E of carbohydrate, although amount of carbohydrate intake did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As a result, %E of protein and fat, and energy intake decreased in both men and women with an increase in %E of carbohydrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among the four quartiles divided by HbA1c levels, there were no significant differences in energy intake and PFC energy ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that, within the range studied, the carbohydrate energy ratio has no correlation with HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels increased and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels decreased significantly, with an increase of %E of carbohydrate in men, and the same tendencies were observed in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in patients with 65%E or more of carbohydrate, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels exceeded 150 mg/dL, which is the recommended treatment target for diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the ideal %E of carbohydrate for Japanese elderly type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is less than 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The lower limit of %E of carbohydrate could not be determined from the present study </plain></SENT>
