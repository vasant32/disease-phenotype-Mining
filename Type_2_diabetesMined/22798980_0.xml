<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Migrant Japanese populations in both the United States and Brazil have for a long time shown a higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in native Japanese, suggesting an interaction of lifestyle and genetic predisposition in the etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall objective of the Seattle Japanese American Community <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study was to learn more about the etiology and pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This metabolically based epidemiologic study included extensive assessments of insulin sensitivity, insulin response, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> with the latter including measurements of body fat distribution by both anthropometry and computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of this, the importance of visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with an examination of diet and physical activity patterns, the result was a clearer understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wepropose that a lifestyle that fosters <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>increased weight</z:mp> gain, especially in the visceral adipose depot, promotes the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> which in turn exposes an underlying reduced beta-cell reserve in susceptible individuals, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and eventually in many the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have shown that it may be possible to delay or prevent the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through dietary and exercise interventions in individuals identified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lessons learned from studying migrant Japanese in Seattle may in many ways be applicable to other populations of Asian origin </plain></SENT>
