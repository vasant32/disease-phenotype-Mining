<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considerable progress has been made recently in understanding the genetic determinants of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A logical next step is to describe how these variants relate to the underlying pathophysiological processes that lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as this may provide insights into pathways to disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These quantitative traits are, of course, of direct interest in themselves and a growing literature is now emerging on the genetic determinants of insulin secretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review article focuses on describing the complex associations between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk variants and quantitative glycaemic traits and the relationship between variants initially discovered in association studies of these traits and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
