<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report for the first time that expression of the insulin receptor (IR) in human kidney is altered during <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We detected a strong expression in proximal and distal tubules from human renal cortex, and a significant reduction in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, isolated proximal tubules from type 1 diabetic rat kidney showed a similar response, supporting its use as an excellent model for in vitro study of human DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IR protein down-regulation was paralleled in proximal and distal tubules from diabetic rats, but prominent in proximal tubules from diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A target of renal insulin signaling, the gluconeogenic enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase (PEPCK), showed increased expression and activity, and localization in compartments near the apical membrane of proximal tubules, which was correlated with activation of the GSK3β kinase in this specific renal structure in the diabetic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, expression of IR protein in proximal tubules from type 1 and type 2 diabetic kidney indicates that this is a common regulatory mechanism which is altered in DN, triggering enhanced gluconeogenesis regardless the etiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
