<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> exhibit considerable platelet dysfunction, though this is poorly characterized in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> taking aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare platelet function in this patient population with that of a high-risk group of non-diabetic subjects with a history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), and to assess whether glycaemic control impacts on platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Platelet aggregation was measured in response to incremental concentrations of five platelet <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> using light transmission aggregometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were taking aspirin, and aspirin insensitivity was defined as ≥ 20% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) mediated aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were divided according to glycaemic control (HbA(1c)): optimal ≤ 6.5, good 6.6-7.4 and suboptimal ≥ 7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: In total, 85 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 35 non-diabetic patients with previous MI were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to MI patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients had increased aggregation in response to multiple concentrations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, collagen, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> and AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin insensitivity was more common in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (15% vs. 0%, p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was increased in response to several <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> patients with suboptimal glycaemic control compared to patients with optimal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin insensitivity was also more common in patients with suboptimal glycaemic control compared to those with good or optimal control (26.0% vs. 8.3% vs. 4%, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, without proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, exhibit platelet dysfunction and have <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> and aspirin insensitivity compared to non-diabetic patients with previous MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Platelet dysfunction in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is more severe in patients with suboptimal glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
