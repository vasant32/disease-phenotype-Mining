<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study tested the hypothesis that food insecurity may deteriorate glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of food insecurity among type 2 diabetics in a major hospital that serves the area of northern Jordan, and to investigate its relation to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of 843 patients diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Socioeconomic and health data were collected by interview-based questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight and height were measured by a trained nutritionist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dietary assessment was done using food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dietary data were processed using food processor software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Food insecurity was assessed by the short form of the U.S. food security survey module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was assessed by measuring glycosyated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical procedures used to analyze the data were chi-square, and post-hoc analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: About 22% of the tested sample were food secure (FS); 51% were moderately food insecure (MFIS); and 27% were severely food insecure (SFIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher BMI was associated with SFIS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, gender, income, education, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, body mass index, and caloric consumption; moderate and severe food insecurity were associated with poor glycemic control (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: food insecurity may be associated with glycemic control deterioration in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
