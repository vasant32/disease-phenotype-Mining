<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As it is important to identify modifiable risk factors that may help reduce the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, the aim of the present study was to determine the association between egg consumption and the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A specifically designed questionnaire was used to collect information on possible risk factors of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were calculated by conditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A case-control study in a Lithuanian out-patient clinic was performed in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: A total of 234 cases with a newly confirmed diagnosis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 468 controls free of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variables such as BMI, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cigarette smoking, education, morning exercise and plasma TAG level were retained in multivariate logistic regression models as confounders because their inclusion changed the value of the odds ratio by more than 10 % in any exposure category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for possible confounders more than twofold increased risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was determined for individuals consuming 3-4·9 eggs/week (OR = 2·60; 95 % CI 1·34, 5·08) and threefold increased risk of the disease was determined for individuals consuming ≥5 eggs/week (OR = 3·02; 95 % CI 1·14, 7·98) compared with those eating &lt;1 egg/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a possible relationship of egg consumption and increased risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
