<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as a significant limiting factor in achieving optimal glycaemic control, exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> can influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> is known to occur in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, its morbidity and impact on the individual are not well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current review is to examine published evidence to achieve a synthesis of the scope and significance of the potential detriment caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> to individuals with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The implications of these observations for treatment and research have also been considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A narrative review was performed of empirical papers published in English since 1966, reporting the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> on quality of life and related outcomes (including generic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific quality of life, emotional well-being and health utilities) in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Research demonstrates the potential impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> on the lives of people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, from an association with depressive symptoms and heightened <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, to impairment of the ability to drive, work and function in ways that are important for quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Few studies consider <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> as an explanatory variable in combination with quality of life or related primary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, there is a pressing need for high-quality research into the overall impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> on the lives of people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
