<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : Patients were recruited from the Sankara Nethralaya-Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Epidemiology and Molecular Genetic Study, a population-based study to estimate the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in urban Chennai, South India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Corneal endothelial morphological features were recorded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects using noncontact specular microscopy and central corneal thickness was measured using ultrasound pachymeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : A total of 1191 cases and 121 controls were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean corneal endothelial cell density (cells/mm) was lower in cases than in controls (2550 ± 326 vs. 2634 ± 256; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in the mean pachymetry values, hexagonality %, and coefficient of variation of cell size between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis, after adjusting for age, showed the mean cell density to be lesser by 66 cells/mm (95% confidence interval, 6.3-125.9) among diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : The results of this study, from a large population-based sample, support the earlier theories of lower endothelial cell counts among subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in comparison with nondiabetic controls </plain></SENT>
