<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> poses a major public health challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Population-based screening and early treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could reduce this growing burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, uncertainty persists around the benefits of screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of a population-based stepwise screening programme on mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a pragmatic parallel group, cluster-randomised trial, 33 general practices in eastern England were randomly assigned by the method of minimisation in an unbalanced design to: screening followed by intensive multifactorial treatment for people diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=15); screening plus routine care of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to national guidelines (n=13); and a no-screening control group (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 20 184 individuals aged 40-69 years (mean 58 years), at high risk of prevalent undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, on the basis of a previously validated risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In screening practices, individuals were invited to a stepwise programme including random capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) tests, a fasting capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test, and a confirmatory oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were flagged for mortality surveillance by the England and Wales Office of National Statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention-to-screen and compared <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality rates between screening and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study is registered, number ISRCTN86769081 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Of 16 047 high-risk individuals in screening practices, 15 089 (94%) were invited for screening during 2001-06, 11 737 (73%) attended, and 466 (3%) were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>4137 control individuals were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During 184 057 person-years of follow up (median duration 9·6 years [IQR 8·9-9·9]), there were 1532 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the screening practices and 377 in control practices (mortality hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·90-1·25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We noted no significant reduction in cardiovascular (HR 1·02, 95% CI 0·75-1·38), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (1·08, 0·90-1·30), or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related mortality (1·26, 0·75-2·10) associated with invitation to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In this large UK sample, screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients at increased risk was not associated with a reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause, cardiovascular, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related mortality within 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The benefits of screening might be smaller than expected and restricted to individuals with detectable disease </plain></SENT>
