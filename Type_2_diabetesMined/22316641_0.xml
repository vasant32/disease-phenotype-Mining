<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing a low-carbohydrate to a low-fat diet in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QOL was assessed with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-39 questionnaire, which measures QOL within 5 distinct scales: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and worry, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control, energy and mobility, social burden, and sexual functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated measures ANOVA compared change in QOL scales at baseline and 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six participants completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following 12 months, there was a significant reduction in the scores related to sexual function and energy and mobility, suggesting improvement in QOL related to these domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes were not significantly different between dietary arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in weight, A1C, and dietary composition were not significantly correlated with changes in QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have various options for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dietary interventions with either low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets may lead to some improvements in QOL in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
