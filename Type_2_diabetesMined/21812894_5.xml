<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their increasing prevalence necessitates further studies on modifiable causative factors and novel treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gut microbiota has emerged as an important contributor to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>--and T2DM--epidemic proposed to act by increasing energy harvest from the diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is associated with substantial changes in the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota, the pathophysiological processes remain only partly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review we will describe the development of the adult human microbiome and discuss how the composition of the gut microbiota changes in response to modulating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short-chain fatty acids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and microbial transplantation is discussed from studies using animal and human models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, we aim to translate these findings into therapeutic pathways for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and T2DM in humans </plain></SENT>
