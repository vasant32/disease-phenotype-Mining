<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a strong relation between some specific oligoelements and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was undertaken to determine serum levels of copper and zinc in 60 type 2 diabetic (Group I) and 60 healthy non-diabetic subjects (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients studied were without any complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum copper and zinc were estimated by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum copper levels (144.00±12.87μg/dl) significantly increased in Group I compared to Group II (138.50±11.00μg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the Plasma zinc (72.70±8.43μg/dl) levels significantly decreased in type 2 diabetic patients compared to control group (75.92±8.20μg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> can result in changes in copper and zinc levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to draw any definite conclusion from this small study sample but may be suggested that estimation of both copper and zinc is better to be considered in those cases </plain></SENT>
