<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the results of a pilot study investigating the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in/near nine circadian genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variants were chosen based on their previously reported association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, a disease that has been suggested to have a genetic link with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through a number of shared inherited risk determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The pilot study was performed using two genetically homogeneous Punjabi cohorts, one resident in the United Kingdom and one indigenous to Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with (N = 1732) and without (N = 1780) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were genotyped for thirteen circadian variants using a competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between the SNPs and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were investigated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were also combined with in silico data from other South Asian datasets (SAT2D consortium) and white European cohorts (DIAGRAM+) using meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rs7602358G allele near PER2 was negatively associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our Punjabi cohorts (combined odds ratio [OR] = 0.75 [0.66-0.86], p = 3.18 Ã— 10(-5)), while the BMAL1 rs11022775T allele was associated with an increased risk of the disease (combined OR = 1.22 [1.07-1.39], p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither of these associations was replicated in the SAT2D or DIAGRAM+ datasets, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cohorts identified disease associations with two variants, rs2292912 in CRY2 and rs12315175 near CRY1, although statistical significance was nominal (combined OR = 1.05 [1.01-1.08], p = 0.008 and OR = 0.95 [0.91-0.99], p = 0.015 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: None of the selected circadian gene variants was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with study-wide significance after meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The nominal association observed with the CRY2 SNP, however, complements previous findings and confirms a role for this locus in disease susceptibility </plain></SENT>
