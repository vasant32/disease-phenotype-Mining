<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the anti-diabetic effects of brown alga, Ecklonia cava was investigated in type 2 diabetic animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db (db/db) mice were divided into control, dieckol rich extract of E. cava (AG-dieckol), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (RG) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, and plasma insulin levels were significantly lower in the AG-dieckol and RG groups than in the control db/db mice group, while <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was significantly improved in the AG-dieckol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AG-dieckol markedly lowered plasma and hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> concentration compared to the control db/db mice group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities were significantly higher in the AG-dieckol group than in the control db/db mice group, yet its TBARS level was markedly lower compared to the RG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulating enzyme activities, glucokinase activity was enhanced in the AG-dieckol group mice, while <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase activities in the AG-dieckol group mice were significantly lowered than those in the control db/db mice group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that AG-dieckol exert an anti-diabetic effect in type 2 diabetic mice by improving the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes </plain></SENT>
