<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of modifiable risk factors to social inequalities in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when these factors are measured at study baseline or repeatedly over follow-up and when long term exposure is accounted for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with risk factors (health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity), body mass index, and biological risk markers (systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>)) measured four times and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status assessed seven times between 1991-93 and 2007-09 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Civil service departments in London (Whitehall II study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 7237 adults without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 49.4 years; 2196 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and contribution of risk factors to its association with socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 14.2 years, 818 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants in the lowest occupational category had a 1.86-fold (hazard ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval 1.48 to 2.32) greater risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relative to those in the highest occupational category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Health behaviours and body mass index explained 33% (-1% to 78%) of this socioeconomic differential when risk factors were assessed at study baseline (attenuation of hazard ratio from 1.86 to 1.51), 36% (22% to 66%) when they were assessed repeatedly over the follow-up (attenuated hazard ratio 1.48), and 45% (28% to 75%) when long term exposure over the follow-up was accounted for (attenuated hazard ratio 1.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With additional adjustment for biological risk markers, a total of 53% (29% to 88%) of the socioeconomic differential was explained (attenuated hazard ratio 1.35, 1.05 to 1.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable risk factors such as health behaviours and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, when measured repeatedly over time, explain almost half of the social inequalities in incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is more than was seen in previous studies based on single measurement of risk factors </plain></SENT>
