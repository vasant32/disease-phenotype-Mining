<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Following pregnancies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>), to assess: the perception by women of the risk of subsequent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the rate of screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the postpartum, and identify the factors leading women to undergo screening, in particular with respect to the information given to the general practitioner (GP) by the obstetrical team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> who delivered in a single academic hospital between 1st June 2008 and 31st May 2009, based on data extracted from files and from phone interviews made 6 to 12 months after the delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 152 GDM cases, 147 medical files were consulted and 124 phone interviews were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one percent of the interviewed women were aware of the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients (65%) underwent postpartum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing, out of which 69 were prescribed by the maternity and 27 women (22%) did not get any prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The compliance rate was 78% (53/69) for the hospital prescriptions and 100% (18/18) for the GP's prescriptions, a significant difference in uptake (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it appears that the information given to the GP is the only factor improving patient awareness about type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P=0.01), as well as their compliance to postpartum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing (P=0.02), only 41 reports (28%) were sent to the GP out of the 63 reports (43%) mentioning the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postpartum testing for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> following a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> was not optimal in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In view of the key role played by the GP in the postpartum period, it appears that cooperation between maternity and GPs needs to be reinforced in order to maximise both proper screening and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> primary prevention following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
