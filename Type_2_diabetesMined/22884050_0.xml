<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the different types of GBP in treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly divided into two groups: those who underwent gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass and those who underwent gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alterations, operation time, and operation complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass and gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass were both effective in the treatment of selected patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass, gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass had the advantages of easier implementation, shorter operation time, and fewer operation complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gastrojejunal loop anastomosis is effective in treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is safe, easy to implement, and worthy of clinical popularization </plain></SENT>
