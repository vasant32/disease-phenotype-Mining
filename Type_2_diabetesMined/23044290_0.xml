<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anisodamine is widely used in therapy for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> because it can improve renal microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a study to evaluate the preventive effects of anisodamine against contrast-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (CIN) in type 2 diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> undergoing coronary angiography or angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 260 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60 ml(-1)×min(-1)×1.73 m(-2) or less, who were undergoing coronary angiography or angioplasty, were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of either <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> (control group, n = 128) or anisodamine (treatment group, n = 132) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the treatment group received an infusion of anisodamine at a rate of 0.2 µg×kg(-1)×min(-1) from 12 hours before to 12 hours after coronary angiography or angioplasty, while patients in the control group received an infusion of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> with the same volume as the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received intravenous <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> hydration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CIN was defined as a 25% increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> from baseline or an absolute increase of &gt; 0.5 mg/dl within three days after contrast exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the incidence of CIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secondary end point was a 25% or greater reduction in eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to age, gender, risk factors, laboratory results, medications and interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CIN was 9.8% (13/132) in the treatment group and 20.3% (26/128) in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The secondary end point was 6.0% (8/132) in the treatment group and 16.4% (21/128) in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate the preventive effects of anisodamine against CIN in type 2 diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> who are undergoing coronary angiography or angioplasty </plain></SENT>
