<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was an observational study soliciting questionnaire data from 193 Danish general practices and register data on 12,960 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age range 40-80 years) from a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> database and a laboratory database </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Practices with well-implemented nurse-led type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consultations and practices with no nurse(s) employed differed according to the mean proportions of patients whose HbA1c was measured (6.4%-points: 95% CI: 1.5 to 11.4), and the mean proportions of patients whose HbA1c was ≥8% (-3.7%-points: 95% CI: -6.7 to -0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small non-significant differences were found in the cholesterol analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with practices with no nurse(s) employed, the quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management was generally higher in terms of that HbA1c was measured according to the guidelines in a larger proportion of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> population and the proportion of patients with an HbA1c level ≥8% was lower in practices with well-implemented nurse-led type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consultations </plain></SENT>
