<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> significantly contributes to high glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations and could be linked to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our review was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety profile of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> alone and combined with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic search strategy was developed to identify randomized controlled trials included in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The terms <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adverse events, combination therapy, and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were incorporated into an electronic search strategy that included the Dickersin filter for randomized controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To qualify for inclusion, clinical trials had to be randomized trials comparing treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> at any dosage with any other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eligible trials had to present results on glycemic control or adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trial participants needed to be affected by type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and the intervention had to include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> at any dosage as monotherapy or combined with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A validated 3-item scale was used to evaluate the overall reporting quality of the trials selected for inclusion in the present review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen trials were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> significantly reduced glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels when given as monotherapy and as an add-on to other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug treatment (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> treatment was effective in patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in patients with apparently good metabolic control owing to its positive effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> seemed to improve the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile (P &lt; 0.05), reduce circulating levels of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (P &lt; 0.05), reduce intima-media thickness progression (P = 0.01), and reverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When current therapy is not adequate to obtain glycemic control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> could be an option as monotherapy and as an add-on to other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug treatment, especially when <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is the main concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Long-term studies are needed to determine whether the effects observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> use are maintained over the years </plain></SENT>
