<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of the current guidelines recommend a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 140 mmHg or lower, unless patients are at high risk for possible adverse events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo> (1,2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This perspective aims to get a discussion started on the appropriate target SBP value for patients with T2DM aged older than 75 years.We would like to propose the less stringent value of&lt; 160 mmHg in this specific population </plain></SENT>
