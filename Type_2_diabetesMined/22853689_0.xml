<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to test the association of LPIN1 variants with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and clinical characteristics in large samples of the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods  In the first stage, 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms within the LPIN1 region were selected and genotyped in 3700 Chinese Han participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second stage, the single nucleotide polymorphisms showing significant association or trends towards association were genotyped in an additional 3122 samples for replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses and genotype-phenotype association studies were performed after combining the data from the two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results  In the first stage, we detected that rs16857876 was significantly associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with an odds ratio of 0.806 (95% CI 0.677-0.958, P = 0.015), while rs11695610 showed a trend with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 0.846, 95% CI 0.709-1.009, P = 0.062) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second stage, a similar effect of rs11695610 on Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed (odds ratio 0.849, 95% CI 0.700-1.030, P = 0.096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The meta-analyses combining the information from the two stages showed a significant effect of rs11695610 on Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with an odds ratio of 0.847 (95% CI 0.744-0.965, P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the phenotype-genotype association analyses showed that rs11695610 was associated with 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.040) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions  Our data implied that common single nucleotide polymorphisms within the LPIN1 region were associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and metabolic traits in the Chinese population. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
