<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between BsmI/ApaI polymorphisms in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor gene and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in a Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to test the genotype and allele frequency of BsmI and ApaI polymorphisms in 304 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM group) and 100 control individuals (ND group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DM group was further divided into DN0 (no diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>), DN1 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with small amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>), DN2 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with large amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>), L/NDN (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> DN after 5 years/no DN over the whole follow-up period of 5 years) and EDN (early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> occurring within first year) subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that (1) genotype and allele frequency of BsmI polymorphism had significant difference between DM and ND group; BB+Bb genotype and B allele frequency were significantly higher in DN2 group than in ND and DN0 group; the ApaI polymorphism and allele frequency did not show any difference between DM and ND group; (2) BsmI BB+Bb genotype and B allele frequency were significantly higher in EDN group than in L/NDN group; (3) among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, albumin excretion rate (AER) in 24-hour urine was significantly higher in those with BB+Bb phenotype than in those with bb phenotype (P&lt;0.01), (4) unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that BsmI BB+Bb genotype was not only correlated with type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, but also correlated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the allele B (BB or Bb genotype) in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor gene is correlated with large amount <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in the Han Chinese population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and is probably a risk factor for early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
