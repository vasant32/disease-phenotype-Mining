<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> exposure to high level of inorganic <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> in drinking water has been associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most research has been ecological in nature and has focused on high levels of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> exposure with few studies directly measuring <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> levels in drinking water as an index of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of low to moderate levels of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> exposure on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk is largely unknown thus our study is adding further knowledge over previous works </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross sectional study was conducted in 1004 consenting women and men from 1682 eligible participants yielding a participation rate of 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These participants are aged &gt;30 years and were living in Bangladesh and had continuously consumed <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi>-contaminated drinking water for at least 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2D cases were diagnosed using glucometer following the new diagnostic criteria (Fasting Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> &gt; 126 mg/dl) from the WHO guideline (WHO 2006), or a self-reported physician diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Association between T2D and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> exposure was estimated by multiple logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, education, Body Mass Index (BMI) and family history of T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1004 individuals participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of T2D was 9% (95% CI 7-11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed for <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> exposure over 50 Î¼g/L with those in the highest category having almost double the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR=1.9 ; 95% CI 1.1-3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For most levels of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> exposure, the risk estimates are higher with longer exposure; a dose-response pattern was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> exposure through drinking water and T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Risks are generally higher with longer duration of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk of T2D is highest among those who were exposed to the highest concentration of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
