<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods:  Patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were randomly assigned to 20 weeks of treatment with twice-daily exenatide plus placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (SWITCH, n = 127) or twice-daily exenatide plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (ADD, n = 128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results:  Non-inferiority (0.4% margin) of SWITCH to ADD treatment, measured by change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 20, was not shown (between-treatment difference in least-squares mean {95% CI 3 mmol/mol (0.30%) [0.8-5.8 (0.07-0.53)]} </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A greater reduction (P = 0.012) in HbA(1c) [least-squares mean (se)] was experienced by patients in the ADD group {-7 mmol/mol [-0.68%] [0.9 (0.08)]}, compared with those in the SWITCH group {-4 mmol/mol [-0.38%] [1.0 (0.09)]} and a greater proportion (P = 0.027) of patients in the ADD group (41.7%) reached &lt; 7.0% (&lt; 53 mmol/mol) HbA(1c) target, compared with those in the SWITCH group (26.6%) by week 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the ADD group experienced greater fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.038) and daily mean postprandial self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.048) reductions, compared with patients in the SWITCH group, by week 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups experienced a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> compared with previous exenatide studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  Non-inferiority of SWITCH to ADD treatment was not supported by the results of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, adding exenatide provided better glycaemic control than switching to exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the clinical approach that adding is better than switching to another oral anti-hyperglycaemic medication. © 2012 Eli Lilly and Company &amp; Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc </plain></SENT>
