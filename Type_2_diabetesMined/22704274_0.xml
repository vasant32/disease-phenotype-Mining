<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although a variety of treatment guidelines for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients are available, a majority of patients does not achieve recommended targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterise Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients from Swiss primary care who miss HbA1c treatment goals and to reveal factors associated with the poorly controlled HbA1c level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional study nested within the cluster randomised controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Care for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with at least one HbA1c measurement ≥ 7.0 % during the last year were recruited from Swiss primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data assessment included <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specific and general clinical measures, treatment factors and patient reported outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 326 Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients from 30 primary care practices with a mean age 67.1 ± 10.6 years participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients' findings for HbA1c were 7.7 ± 1.3 %, for systolic blood pressure 139.1 ± 17.6 mmHg, for diastolic blood pressure 80.9 ± 10.5 mmHg and for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> 2.7 ± 1.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>93.3 % of the patients suffered from at least one comorbidity and were treated with 4.8 ± 2.1 different drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No determining factor was significantly related to HbA1c in the multiple analysis, but a significant clustering effect of GPs on HbA1c could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within our sample of patients with poorly controlled Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, no "bullet points" could be pointed out which can be addressed easily by some kind of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Especially within this subgroup of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients who would benefit the most from appropriate interventions to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control, a complex interaction between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control, comorbidities, GPs' treatment and patients' health behaviour seems to exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>So far this interaction is only poorly described and understood </plain></SENT>
