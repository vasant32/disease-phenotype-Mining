<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status in patients with uncomplicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in order to understand the interactions between its components and the diabetic milieu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 15 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents and from 18 healthy control subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> was measured as an indicator of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total and residual <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> were measured as indicators of plasma <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Copper and caeruloplasmin were also assayed as possible pro-oxidants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> activities, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> level, copper concentration and caeruloplasmin activity were significantly increased in the plasma of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity of plasma was increased, despite high levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, in patients with uncomplicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of copper and caeruloplasmin characterized the diabetic milieu, despite an absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
