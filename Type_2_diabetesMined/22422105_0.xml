<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exhaustive treadmill exercise 5 days a week for 8 weeks had no effect on their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, nor did the β(2)-blocking drug ICI 118551 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, exercise combined with the β(2)-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi>) had a beneficial effect on both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin sensitivity after 4 and 8 weeks of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect was durable and persisted 5 weeks after exercise and β(2)-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> had stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To test whether β(2)-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> alone was effective, the animals that had received β(2)-blockade were then given β(2)-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
