<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the safety and efficacy of insulin glargine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before and after Ramadan and during fasting for Ramadan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this open, descriptive, multi-centre, prospective study, insulin-na√Øve (n = 100) or previously insulin-treated (n = 249) patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received insulin glargine [titrated from 10 U daily according to fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG)] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (4 mg daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> and glycaemic control were assessed before, during and after Ramadan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors which predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> during Ramadan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only one episode of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> occurred in each time period before, during and after Ramadan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> increased from 156 pre-Ramadan to 346 during Ramadan (P &lt; 0.001) and decreased to 153 post-Ramadan (P = 0.0002).The increase during Ramadan was mainly attributed to increased symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FBG and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> improved during the titration period and did not change during the rest of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk of hypoglycaemic events during Ramadan was higher in countries where fasting is strict [odds ratio (OR) 3.69 (2.06-6.63), P &lt; 0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower weight [&lt; 70.0 kg; OR 2.56 (1.46-4.48), P = 0.001] and waist circumference [&lt; 90 cm; OR 3.06 (1.62-5.78), P = 0.001] increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> during Ramadan whilst FBG &gt; 6.7 mmol/l [OR 0.3 (0.17-0.54), P &lt; 0.0001] had a protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination of insulin glargine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> may be used during Ramadan in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who wish to fast, provided <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> is given at the time of breaking the fast and insulin glargine titrated to provide FBG &gt; 6.7 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
