<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While there is growing evidence for a role for FTO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> risk in Asians, its association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independently of BMI, remains inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test whether there is an association of the FTO locus with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we conducted a meta-analysis of 32 populations including 96,551 East and South Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies published on the association between FTO-rs9939609 (or proxy [r (2) &gt; 0.98]) and BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in East or South Asians were invited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each study group analysed their data according to a standardised analysis plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also adjusted for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to pool <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FTO-rs9939609 minor allele increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> by 1.25-fold/allele (p = 9.0 × 10(-19)), overweight by 1.13-fold/allele (p = 1.0 × 10(-11)) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by 1.15-fold/allele (p = 5.5 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was attenuated after adjustment for BMI (OR 1.10-fold/allele, p = 6.6 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FTO-rs9939609 minor allele <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> by 0.26 kg/m(2) per allele (p = 2.8 × 10(-17)), WHR by 0.003/allele (p = 1.2 × 10(-6)), and body fat percentage by 0.31%/allele (p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Associations were similar using dominant models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While the minor allele is less common in East Asians (12-20%) than South Asians (30-33%), the effect of FTO variation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was similar in the two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: FTO is associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with effect sizes similar in East and South Asians and similar to those observed in Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, FTO is also associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of BMI </plain></SENT>
