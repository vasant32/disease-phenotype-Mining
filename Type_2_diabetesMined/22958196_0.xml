<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects and Methods: β-Cell dysfunction was assessed by measuring changes in the fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into two groups: cases showing a decreased (Group D) or an unchanged or increased (Group I) C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration from the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Of the 504 patients included in this study, 259 (51%) showed decreased C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations, of whom 20% showed a decrease of ≥50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients, however, had a final C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration of ≥1 ng/mL, with only 18 (4%) individuals having a level &lt;0.6 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in Group D had a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, higher initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c concentration, and longer treatment durations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and insulin compared with Group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> follow-up period, the duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> treatment was found to be the only factor independently associated with decreases in the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Although β-cell function deteriorates over time in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, these cases mainly have fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations of ≥1 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A longer treatment duration with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> is associated with a more rapid decline in the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
