<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between magnitude of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improvement in percentage A1C (A1C%) among overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) undergoing weight reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case records of patients enrolled in 2 university-based weight management programs were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were sampled if they had a diagnosis of DM and had at least 1 documented A1C% reduction from their baseline value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> treatment was individualized and consisted of a calorie-restricted diet, a behavior modification plan, and a plan for increasing physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient weights were measured at bimonthly visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A1C% was measured every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-two patients formed the study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline body mass index was 35.1 kg/m(2), mean age was 52.6 years, and 59% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean starting A1C% was 8.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients achieved significant mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (10.7 kg) at study exit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> of 6.5 kg (4.5% of baseline body weight), 12.2 kg (8.7%), and 15.9 kg (10.3%) was required to reduce A1C% by 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively, and it took a mean of 5.6, 8.7, and 10.1 months, respectively, to achieve this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication intake, for every 10% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, the predicted reduction in A1C% was 0.81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 10% can potentially decrease A1C% by 0.81 among patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This finding may be clinically useful in encouraging and counseling a patient attempting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
