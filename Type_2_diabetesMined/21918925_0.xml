<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The treatment goals recommended by the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) for patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1C) &lt;7.0%, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) &lt;100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;130 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 10% of conventionally treated patients reach these goals as a composite endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in meeting this composite endpoint has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared our database of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> undergoing RYGB to a database of patients with medically managed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and at least 2 years of follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultimately, 152 RYGB patients were compared to 115 routine medical management (RMM) patients for whom data on the composite endpoint were available over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show significant decrease in body mass index (kilograms per square meter) in the RYGB group compared to the RMM group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1C, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and SBP <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly improved in the RYGB group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P ≤ 0.01) and did not demonstrate any significant change in the RMM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 2 years, when evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three endpoints, the RYGB group (10.5% to 38.2%, P &lt; 0.001) demonstrated increased achievement of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> goals compared to the RMM group (13.9% to 17.4%, P = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in medication use in the RYGB cohort; however, discontinuation of medications was sometimes inappropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RYGB achieves the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> composite endpoint more frequently than conventional therapy and with less medication </plain></SENT>
