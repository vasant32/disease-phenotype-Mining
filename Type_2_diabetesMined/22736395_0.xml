<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main objective was to compare outcomes in those with HbA(1c) ≥ and &lt;7% (53 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from Aarhus County, Denmark, were identified from public data files in a 3 year period (2001-2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stratifying the 17,760 individuals by HbA(1c), we estimated HRs for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were also stratified by treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1,805 individuals experienced at least one <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidity and 1,859 individuals died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, the HRs in adjusted analyses of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidity and mortality were increased for HbA(1c) ≥ 7% (53 mmol/mol): morbidity, HR 1.48 (95% CI 1.34, 1.63); and mortality, HR 1.26 (95% CI 1.15, 1.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On grouping individuals according to HbA(1c) &lt;5% (31 mmol/mol), 5.0-5.9% (31-41 mmol/mol), 6.0-6.9% (42-52 mmol/mol), 7.0-7.9% (53-63 mmol/mol), 8.0-8.9% (64-74 mmol/mol) and ≥ 9% (75 mmol/mol), the HRs for mortality formed a U shape, with HbA(1c) 6.0-6.9% (42-52 mmol/mol) at the lowest point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidity, a dose-response pattern appeared (lowest for HbA(1c) &lt; 5% [31 mmol/mol]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patterns of HR differed with treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: An HbA(1c) level ≥ 7% (53 mmol/mol) was associated with increased morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both high and very low levels of HbA(1c) were associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A dose-response pattern appeared for morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The impact of HbA(1c) level on morbidity and mortality depended on treatment modality </plain></SENT>
