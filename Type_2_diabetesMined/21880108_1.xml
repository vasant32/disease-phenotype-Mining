<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the impact of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) through a systematic review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data was sourced from Scopus, MEDLINE and EMBASE published from 2000 through May 2011, and five unpublished studies that were performed by industry for regulatory approval were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies were selected on the basis that they provide some detail of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status before and after LAGB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 35 studies meeting the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in study design, sample size, length of follow-up, attrition rates and classification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> was progressive over the first 2 years with a weighted average of 47% excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remission or improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> varied from 53% to 70% over different time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were broadly consistent, demonstrating clinically relevant improvements in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes with sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> following LAGB surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there were significant shortcomings in the reviewed literature with few high-quality studies, inconsistent reporting of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes and high attrition rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term studies that address these limitations are needed </plain></SENT>
