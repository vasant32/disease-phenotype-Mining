<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Altered fatty acid patterns in blood may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether serum proportions of cholesteryl fatty acids and desaturase activity are associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional study among 471 Dutch participants aged ≥40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual fatty acids in serum cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> were determined and endogenous conversions by desaturases were estimated from product-to-precursor ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proportions of fatty acids were compared among participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial Spearman correlation coefficients between fatty acids and homeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustments were made for lifestyle and nutritional factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportions of total saturated, mono-unsaturated, trans- and poly-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> did not differ significantly between groups, but several individual fatty acids did; the proportions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">C18:0</z:chebi> and C20:3n6 were higher, whereas those of C18:1n7 and C20:4n6 were lower in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activity of Δ5-desaturase, that is, ratio of C20:4n6 to C20:3n6, was lower (p &lt; 0.01) in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (7.4) than with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (8.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HOMA-IR was correlated positively with Δ9-desaturase activity (r = 0.11, p &lt; 0.01) and inversely with Δ5-desaturase activity (r = -0.21, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed lower Δ5-desaturase activity in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its inverse association with HOMA-IR suggest that changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35366">fatty-acid</z:chebi> metabolism may play a role in the aetiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
