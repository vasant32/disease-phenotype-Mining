<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research project was to identify psychological responses to qigong vs control interventions in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized, controlled, three-arm clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of Yi Ren Medical Qigong (YRMQ), progressive resistance training (PRT), and standard care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The study was performed at Bastyr University Research Institute, Kenmore, Washington </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 13 men and 19 women (N=32) with diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a mean age of 56.3 Â± 8.1 (standard deviation) years, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &gt; 7.5%, and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; 7 mmol/dL (126 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: For 12 weeks, participants in the YRMQ and PRT group attended a 1-hour weekly group session that a certified instructor led and were instructed to practice at least twice a week for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team used the Perceived Stress Scale and the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory scores to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: YRMQ decreased perceived-stress scores by 29.3% (P &lt; .05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores by 14.3% (not significant [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The active control group, PRT, also decreased stress scores by 18.6% (NS) and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores by 50% (P &lt; .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stress and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> measures remained unchanged in the standard care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: YRMQ and PRT may be beneficial in reducing perceived stress and improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although verification of the clinical significance of these findings requires a longer study with a larger sample size </plain></SENT>
