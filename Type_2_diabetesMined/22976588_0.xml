<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to implement the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program in community pharmacy using a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk prediction tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The program was conducted in seven pharmacies in Bangkok, Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were the pharmacy's clients aged ≥35 years without the history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A validated risk prediction tool was used to assess individuals' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Educational information was offered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those with a high risk score (≥9 out of 17) were offered a self-check of fasting capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (CBG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A referral was made for those with CBG ≥126 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 3-month service, 397 individuals participated in the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of the participants (49.4%) were at a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (risk score: ≥9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ninety five (48.5%) of these high risk individuals undertook fasting CBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elevated fasting CBG (≥126 mg/dl) was found in 12 persons (12.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, two patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified during the provision of the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program in community pharmacies uncovered half of the clients who were at risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and provided an opportunity for participants to learn more about the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
