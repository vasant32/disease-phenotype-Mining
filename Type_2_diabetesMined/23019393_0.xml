<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations and various clinical parameters, including metabolic factors, plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response after a meal tolerance test, and microvascular complications, in Korean patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 337 male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were subjected to a meal tolerance test and underwent assessment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, fasting and postprandial β-cell responsiveness, and microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations had a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a lower body mass index, and lower concentrations of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also had lower levels of postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, Δ C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and postprandial β-cell responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, there was a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations were independently associated with Δ C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels and postprandial β-cell responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations are associated with postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
