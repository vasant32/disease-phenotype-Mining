<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Osmotic fragility test is an index of the function of cytoskeletal proteins and of the calcium pump activity in RBC membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the effect of physiological calcium supplement on red blood cell osmotic fragility of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Osmotic fragility of red cells was determined for 30 healthy subjects and 30 patients in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> gradient medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5 mg/dl of calcium was added to media and the osmotic fragility were evaluated for RBCs of patients and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of patients and control group showed higher sensitivity of red cells of patients to osmotic fragility upon exposure to higher <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of initial, fifty percent and total <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> showed significant difference on initial and fifty percent <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> between two groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In healthy subjects, Fifty percent <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> index showed a smaller change after addition of calcium, from 4.1 ± 0.22 to 3.9 ± 0.2 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> index for patients significantly decreased from 4.45 ± 0.17 to 4 ± 0.17 after addition of calcium (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Osmotic fragility increases in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of calcium in cell membrane integrity was more prominent in the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than the healthy subjects, emphasizing the role of calcium on the membrane stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We showed for the first time that controlling <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> concentration in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could exert a protective and beneficial role against membrane-affecting conditions </plain></SENT>
