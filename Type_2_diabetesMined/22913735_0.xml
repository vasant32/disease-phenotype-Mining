<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin (Trajenta®, Tradjenta™, Trazenta™, Trayenta™) is an oral, highly selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and is the first agent of its class to be eliminated predominantly via a nonrenal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin is indicated for once-daily use for the treatment of adults with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and a twice-daily fixed-dose combination of linagliptin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (Jentadueto®) is also available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, the pharmacological, clinical efficacy and tolerability data relevant to the use of linagliptin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of oral linagliptin in the treatment of adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been investigated in several double-blind, multicentre trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following 12-24 weeks of treatment, improvements in glycaemic control parameters, including glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c); primary endpoint in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials), were seen with linagliptin relative to placebo when used as monotherapy, initial combination therapy (with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) or add-on therapy to other oral antihyperglycaemia agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>) or basal insulin (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of lowering HbA(1c), linagliptin was more effective than voglibose in a 26-week monotherapy trial and noninferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> when used as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in a 104-week study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional trials and subgroup analyses of pooled data suggest that linagliptin improves glycaemic control regardless of factors such as age, duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ethnicity and renal function, and as linagliptin is eliminated primarily via a nonrenal route, it can be used without dosage adjustment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> of any degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oral linagliptin was generally well tolerated and was associated with a low likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (except when used in combination with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>) and had little effect on bodyweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further long-term and comparative efficacy and tolerability data are required to help position linagliptin more definitively with respect to other antihyperglycaemia agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, clinical data currently available indicate that linagliptin is an effective and generally well tolerated treatment option for use in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> for whom other antihyperglycaemia agents require dosage adjustment or are not suitable </plain></SENT>
