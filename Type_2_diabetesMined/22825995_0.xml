<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several biomarkers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo>, including lower plasma bicarbonate and higher <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> gap, have been associated with greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in cross-sectional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine whether lower plasma bicarbonate is associated with the development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective, nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma bicarbonate was measured in 630 women who did not have type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> at the time of blood draw in 1989-1990 but developed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> during 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were matched according to age, ethnic background, fasting status and date of blood draw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by category of baseline plasma bicarbonate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for matching factors, body mass index, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, women with plasma bicarbonate above the median level had lower odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.96) compared with women below the median level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those in the second (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.67-1.25), third (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.97) and fourth (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54-1.05) quartiles of plasma bicarbonate had lower odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those in the lowest quartile (p for trend = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for C-reactive protein did not alter these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Higher plasma bicarbonate levels were associated with lower odds of incident type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> among women in the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm this finding in different populations and to elucidate the mechanism for this relation </plain></SENT>
