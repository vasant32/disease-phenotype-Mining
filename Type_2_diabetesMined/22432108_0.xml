<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Misdiagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) remains widespread, despite the benefits of optimized management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study examined diagnostic misclassification of MODY in subjects with clinically labeled <z:hpo ids='HP_0011462'>young adult-onset</z:hpo> type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by extending genetic testing beyond current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals were selected for diagnostic sequencing if they displayed features atypical for their diagnostic label </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 247 case subjects with clinically labeled type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we sequenced hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 α (HNF1A) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4A) in 20 with residual β-cell function ≥ 3 years from diagnosis (random or glucagon-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ≥ 0.2 nmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 322 with clinically labeled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we sequenced HNF1A and HNF4A in 80 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed ≤ 30 years and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed ≤ 45 years without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also sequenced the glucokinase (GCK) in 40 subjects with mild fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the type 1 diabetic group, two HNF1A mutations were found (0.8% prevalence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic subjects, 10 HNF1A, two HNF4A, and one GCK mutation were identified (4.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 47% of MODY case subjects identified met current guidelines for diagnostic sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up revealed a further 12 mutation carriers among relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven percent of newly identified MODY subjects changed treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with improved glycemic control (HbA(1c) 8.8 vs. 7.3% at 3 months; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The systematic use of widened diagnostic testing criteria doubled the numbers of MODY case subjects identified compared with current clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The yield was greatest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011462'>young adult-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We recommend that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed before age 30 and with presence of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at 3 years' duration are considered for molecular diagnostic analysis </plain></SENT>
