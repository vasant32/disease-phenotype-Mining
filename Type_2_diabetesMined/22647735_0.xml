<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate YKL-40 levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> (CP) with and without secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) to investigate whether elevated plasma YKL-40 could play a primary role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or rather represent a consequence of the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 were measured during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in 8 patients with CP and secondary DM, 8 patients with CP and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), and 8 healthy control subjects (CTRLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma YKL-40 and IL-6 were significantly higher in patients with CP and secondary DM (YKL-40, mean [95% confidence interval], 113 [60-215 ng/mL]; IL-6, 4.6 [2.3-9.1 pg/mL]) compared to patients with CP and NGT (YKL-40, 42 [28-63 ng/mL]; IL-6, 1.4 [0.8-2.4 pg/mL]) and healthy control subjects (YKL-40, 46 [31-69 ng/mL]; IL-6, 1.4 [0.8-2.4 pg/mL]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CP and secondary DM have elevated levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 compared to CP patients with NGT and healthy subjects, suggesting that YKL-40 is not a primary mediator of DM but a consequence of the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
