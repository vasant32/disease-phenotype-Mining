<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of ongoing group based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management education (DSME) for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 146 patients were randomised to either group education or waiting list control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were A1C and patient activation measured with patient activation measure (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in the primary outcomes between the groups at 12 months, but the control group had an increase in A1C of 0.3% points during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> knowledge and some self-management skills improved significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sub group analysis was conducted for the quartile with the highest A1C at baseline (&gt;7.7, n=18 in both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant improvements within the intervention group at 12 month follow-up for both A1C and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi> and a trend for better outcome in the intervention group compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The locally developed ongoing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management education programs prevented an increase in A1C and can have an effect on A1C in patients with higher A1C level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Locally developed programs may be less effective than programs developed for studies </plain></SENT>
