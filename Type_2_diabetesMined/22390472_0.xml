<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma N-terminal (NT)-proBNP predicts CV mortality in diabetic patients but the association between P-NT-proBNP and the putative residual abnormalities in such patients are not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined echocardiographic measurements of LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and LV dysfunction and their relation to P-NT-proBNP levels or subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> receiving intensive multifactorial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Echocardiography including tissue Doppler imaging and P-NT-proBNP measurements were performed in 200 patients without prior CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with P-NT-proBNP &gt; 45.2 ng/L and/or coronary calcium score ≥ 400 were stratified as high risk patients for CAD(n = 133) and examined for significant CAD by myocardial perfusion imaging and/or CT-angiography and/or coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LV mass index was 41.2 ± 10.9 g/m2.7 and 48 (24%) patients had LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LA and RA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> were found in 54(27%) and 45(23%) patients, respectively, and LV diastolic dysfunction was found in 109(55%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with increased P-NT-proBNP levels did not have more major echocardiographic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 70(53%) of 133 high risk patients significant CAD was demonstrated and patients with LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> had increased risk of significant CAD(adjusted odd ratio[CI] was 4.53[1.14-18.06]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> that received intensive multifactorial treatment, P-NT-proBNP levels is not associated with echocardiographic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LV diastolic dysfunction was frequently observed, whereas LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was less frequent but associated with significant CAD </plain></SENT>
