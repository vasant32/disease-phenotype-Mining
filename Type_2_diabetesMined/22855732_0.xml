<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular events in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Swedish <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> Subjects (SOS) study is a prospective, controlled intervention study that examines the effects of bariatric surgery on hard end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular events in the SOS study participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAll SOS study participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline were included in the analyses (n = 345 in the surgery group and n = 262 in the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 13.3 years (interquartile range 10.2-16.4 years) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiovascular events.RESULTSBariatric surgery was associated with a reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> incidence (38 events among the 345 subjects in the surgery group vs. 43 events among the 262 subjects in the control group; log-rank P = 0.017; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.56 [95% CI 0.34-0.93]; P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No effect of bariatric surgery was observed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence (34 events among the 345 subjects in the surgery group vs. 24 events among the 262 subjects in the control group; log-rank P = 0.852; adjusted HR 0.73 [0.41-1.30]; P = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of surgery in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> incidence was stronger in individuals with higher serum total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> at baseline (interaction P value = 0.02 for both traits) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMI (interaction P value = 0.12) was not related to the surgery outcome.CONCLUSIONSBariatric surgery reduces the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
