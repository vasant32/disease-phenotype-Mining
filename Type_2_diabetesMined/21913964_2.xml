<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of susceptibility genetic variants, individually, together and in combination with conventional risk factors, on Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 33 variants in 1808 Indian patients and 1549 control subjects and performed association analyses with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits using an additive model for individual variant and for genetic risk score based on 32 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discriminatory value of genetic risk over conventional risk factors was analysed using receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allelic odds ratio ranged from 1.01 (95% CI 0.85-1.19) to 1.66 (95% CI 1.32-2.01) for single-variant analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although, only 16 variants had significant odds ratios, the direction of association for others was similar to earlier reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at each genetic risk score point was 1.11 (95% CI 1.09-1.14; P = 5.6 × 10(-17)) and individuals with extremes of genetic risk score (≥ 29.0 and ≤ 17.0) had a 7.5-fold difference in risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discrimination rate between control subjects and patients improved marginally on addition of genetic risk score to conventional risk factors (area under curve = 0.959 and 0.963, respectively; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the quantitative traits analysed, MC4R variants showed strong association with BMI (P = 4.1 × 10(-4)), fat mass per cent (P = 2.4 × 10(-4)) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits, including waist circumference and hip circumference (P = 2.0 × 10(-3) for both), as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P =0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We replicated the association of well-established common variants with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Indians and observed a similar association as reported in Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined analysis of 32 variants <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> identification of subgroups at increased risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but adds only a minor advantage over conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
