<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for the first time, we investigated whether SC aqueous seed extract (100, 200, or 400 mg/kg) exerts any beneficial effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR), serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status, and/or pancreatic β-cell damage in high-fat diet / <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced (HFD-STZ) diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were fed with HFD (55% of calories as fat) during the experiment to induce IR and on the 10th day were injected with STZ (40 mg/kg, i.p.) to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, after confirmation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on the 14th day (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt; 13.89 mM), diabetic rats were treated with SC for the next 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic rats showed increased serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, IR, TNF-α, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi>-reactive substances with a concomitant decrease in β-cell function and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, catalase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of their pancreas revealed pathological changes in islets and β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These alterations reverted to near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels after treatment with SC at 400 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hepatic tissue demonstrated increased PPARγ and PPARα protein expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study demonstrated the beneficial effect of SC seed extract on IR and β-cell dysfunction in HFD-STZ-induced type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
