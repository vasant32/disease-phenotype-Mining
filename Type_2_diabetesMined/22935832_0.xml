<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate how many type 2 diabetic patients receive antiplatelet therapy according to the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) guidelines on primary and secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional study based on information in medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A random sample of 170 type 2 diabetics seen in an urban Health Centre was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The data collected including, age, sex, antiplatelet therapy according to the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>, antiplatelet therapy indicated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and other clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the subjects analysed, 56.9% were males, and the mean age was 67.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (71.2%) were on primary prevention, and 44.4% of the diabetics were receiving adequate antiplatelet therapy according to the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the subjects on secondary prevention, 90.9% received adequate antiplatelet therapy, while only 25.7% of those on primary prevention received it, which was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most used antiplatelet drug was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on primary prevention does not receive adequate antiplatelet therapy, according to the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, patients on secondary prevention receive sufficient antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The benefits of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> are well documented in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the role of antiplatelet therapy in diabetics on primary prevention is not clear and is the subject of discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From 2006 to 2011, the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> has modified the recommendation level of primary prevention antiplatelet therapy, thus decreasing the percentage of patients that may be given antiplatelet therapy with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, to the extent that it increases the cardiovascular risk calculation required for its indication </plain></SENT>
