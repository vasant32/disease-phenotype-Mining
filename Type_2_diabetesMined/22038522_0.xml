<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that a subset of these variants may have different effects on the transition from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (NFG) to impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) than on that from IFG to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 16 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk variants from the Illumina Broad Candidate-gene Association Resource (CARe) array genotyped in 26,576 CARe participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were categorised at baseline as NFG, IFG or type 2 diabetic (n = 16,465, 8,017 or 2,291, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using Cox proportional hazards and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs), we compared rates of progression by genotype for 4,909 (NFG to IFG) and 1,518 (IFG to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then performed multinomial regression analyses at baseline, comparing the risk of assignment to the NFG, IFG or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups by genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of progression from NFG to IFG was significantly greater in participants carrying the risk allele at MTNR1B (p = 1 Ã— 10(-4)), nominally greater at GCK and SLC30A8 (p &lt; 0.05) and nominally smaller at IGF2BP2 (p = 0.01) than the rate of progression from IFG to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by the LRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of the baseline, multinomial regression model were consistent with these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Common genetic risk variants at GCK, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2 and MTNR1B influence to different extents the development of IFG and the transition from IFG to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings may have implications for understanding the genetic contribution of these variants to the development of IFG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
