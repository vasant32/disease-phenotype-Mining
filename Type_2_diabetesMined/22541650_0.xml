<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship of circulating levels of soluble form of LR11 (sLR11; also called SorLA or SORL1), with the progression of proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were divided into 2 sex- and age-matched groups: one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> (n = 29) and the other with nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum sLR11 levels were measured with an immunodetection system followed by chemifluorescence quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum sLR11 levels were higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> group than in the nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> group (5.8 ± 1.2 U vs 3.7 ± 1.3 U; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate regression analysis showed that circulating sLR11 is a factor contributing to the prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> independent of other classical risk factors, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the sensitivity and the specificity were equivalent to or more than those of other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the classical risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels showed the highest correlation coefficient (P &lt; .01) for the sLR11 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum sLR11 concentration may reflect the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>sLR11, released from immature vascular cells and indicating the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, is expected to be a novel candidate biomarker indicating diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
