<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using discrete choice methods, we surveyed patients about their preferences for patient education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated preferred content and format regarding education on living well with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, preventing complications, healthy eating, exercising, and psychosocial issues related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We obtained usable responses from 2187 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acquiring competencies to live a fulfilling life with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjust diet and exercise habits, and prevent complications was significantly more highly valued than was simply being informed about these topics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients preferred to be involved in the planning of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care and valued individually tailored content higher than prescheduled content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women and younger patients found diet and exercise significantly more important than did men, and patients with poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> valued <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> education and support more highly than did patients in better control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prefer to be actively involved in educational activities, to develop competencies to prevent and manage complications, and to involve their social network in supporting them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future patient education should enhance participation and competence development and include relatives </plain></SENT>
