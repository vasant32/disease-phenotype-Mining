<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a standardized data set for measuring pregnancy outcomes in women with Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to compare recent outcomes with those of the 2002-2003 Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Existing regional, national and international data sets were compared for content, consistency and validity to develop a standardized data set for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in pregnancy of 46 key clinical items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data set was tested retrospectively using data from 2007-2008 pregnancies included in three regional audits (Northern, North West and East Anglia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies resulting in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> or live birth were compared with those from the same regions during 2002-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Details of 1381 pregnancies, 812 (58.9%) in women with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 556 (40.3%) in women with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were available to test the proposed standardized data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 46 data items proposed, only 16 (34.8%), predominantly the delivery and neonatal items, achieved ≥ 85% completeness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ethnic group data were available for 746 (54.0%) pregnancies and BMI for 627 (46.5%) pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control data were most complete-available for 1217 pregnancies (88.1%), during the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 239 women (19.9%) had adequate pregnancy preparation, defined as pre-conception <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and first trimester HbA(1c) ≤ 7% (≤ 53 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse outcome rates (major malformation and perinatal mortality) were 55/1000 and had not improved since 2002-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A standardized data set for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in pregnancy may improve consistency of data collection and allow for more meaningful evaluation of pregnancy outcomes in women with pregestational <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
