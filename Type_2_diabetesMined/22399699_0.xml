<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present data concerning the relationship between changes in physical fitness and modifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the Italian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and Exercise Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sedentary patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 606) were enrolled in 22 outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics and randomized to twice-a-week supervised aerobic and resistance training plus exercise counseling versus counseling alone for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline to end-of-study changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and flexibility, as assessed by Vo(2max) estimation, a 5-8 maximal repetition test, and a hip/trunk flexibility test, respectively, were calculated in the whole cohort, and multiple regression analyses were applied to assess the relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in Vo(2max), upper and lower body strength, and flexibility were significantly associated with the variation in the volume of physical activity, HbA(1c), BMI, waist circumference, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) risk score, and inversely, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in fitness predicted improvements in HbA(1c), waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, hs-CRP, and CHD risk score, independent of study arm, BMI, and in case of strength, also waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity/exercise-induced increases in fitness, particularly muscular, predict improvements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, thus indicating the need for targeting fitness in these individuals, particularly in subjects who struggle to lose weight </plain></SENT>
