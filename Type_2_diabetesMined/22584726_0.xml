<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) provide another dimension to these data by associating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that integrating SNPs known to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with eQTLs and coexpression networks would enable the discovery of novel candidate genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected 32 SNPs associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in two or more independent GWASs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used previously described eQTLs mapped from genotype and gene expression data collected from 1,008 morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients to find genes with expression associated with these SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We linked these genes to coexpression modules, and ranked the other genes in these modules using an inverse sum score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 62 genes with expression associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We validated our method by linking highly ranked genes in the coexpression modules back to SNPs through a combined eQTL dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We showed that the eQTLs highlighted by this method are significantly enriched for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC, p = 0.026) and the Gene Environment Association Studies (GENEVA, p = 0.042), validating our approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many of the highly ranked genes are also involved in the regulation or metabolism of insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have devised a novel method, involving the integration of datasets of different modalities, to discover novel candidate genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
