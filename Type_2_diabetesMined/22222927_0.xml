<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness, ectopic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation, and insulin sensitivity among youth with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 137 youth ages 13-18 years including 27 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 97 overweight normoglycemic controls, and 13 healthy weight normoglycemic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was cardiorespiratory fitness defined as peak oxygen uptake indexed to fat free mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included liver and muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content determined by (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and insulin sensitivity determined by frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite similar measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, peak oxygen uptake was 11% lower (38.9 ± 7.9 vs. 43.9 ± 6.1 ml/kgFFM/min, P = 0.002) and hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content was nearly threefold higher (14.4 vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001) in youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relative to overweight controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 137 youth, cardiorespiratory fitness was negatively associated with hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content (r = -0.22, P = 0.02) and positively associated with insulin sensitivity (r = 0.29, P = 0.002) independent of total body and visceral fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content was also negatively associated with insulin sensitivity (r = -0.35, P &lt; 0.001), independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, sex, age, and peak oxygen uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that low cardiorespiratory fitness and elevated hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content are features of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cardiorespiratory fitness and hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> are associated with insulin sensitivity in youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> are potential clinical biomarkers for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among youth </plain></SENT>
