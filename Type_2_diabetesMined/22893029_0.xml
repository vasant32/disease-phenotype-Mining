<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used an area-based measure of SES, Scottish national <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> register data linked to mortality records, and general population cause-specific mortality data to investigate the relationships between SES, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) and cerebrovascular disease (CbVD), for 2001-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used negative binomial regression to obtain age-adjusted RRs of mortality (by sex), comparing people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with the non-diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 216,652 people aged 40 years or older with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (980,687 person-years), there were 10,554 IHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 4,378 CbVD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-standardised mortality increased with increasing deprivation, and was higher among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> mortality RRs were highest among the least deprived quintile and lowest in the most deprived quintile (men: least deprived, RR 1.94 [95% CI 1.61, 2.33]; most deprived, RR 1.46 [95% CI 1.23, 1.74]) and were higher in women than men (women: least deprived, RR 2.84 [95% CI 2.12, 3.80]; most deprived, RR 2.04 [95% CI 1.55, 2.69]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar, weaker, pattern was observed for cerebrovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Absolute risk of cardiovascular mortality is higher in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in the non-diabetic population and increases with increasing deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on cardiovascular mortality differs by SES, and further efforts to reduce cardiovascular risk both in deprived groups and people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may reduce socioeconomic health inequalities </plain></SENT>
