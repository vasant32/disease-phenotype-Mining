<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) and smooth muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs) are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between vasoregenerative EPCs or CACs and damaging SMPCs and the development of accelerated MVD in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tried to elucidate whether EPC, CAC and SMPC numbers and differentiation capacities in vitro differ in patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from individuals with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and MVD (coronary or peripheral artery disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EPC and SMPC numbers were determined with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CAC and SMPC numbers were quantified after in vitro culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their in vitro differentiation capacity was investigated with real-time RT-PCR and quantitative immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In diabetic patients both EPC and CAC levels were reduced (1.3-fold [p &lt; 0.05] and 1.5-fold [p &lt; 0.05], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAC outgrowth from diabetic patients with MVD was reduced 1.5-fold compared with diabetic patients without MVD (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SMPC levels were similar between diabetic patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CAC/SMPC ratio of in vitro cultured progenitor cells was reduced 2.3-fold in samples from diabetic patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The differentiation capacity of CACs and SMPCs in vitro remained similar independently of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The ratio between EPCs or CACs and SMPCs is disturbed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in favour of SMPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This may translate into reduced vascular repair capacity, thereby promoting MVD in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
