<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Cross sectional data regarding primary prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> risk score was developed by using simple parameters namely age, waist circumference, and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios of the model were used to assign a score value for each variable and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk score was calculated as the sum of those scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We externally validated the score using two data from 1264 subjects and 856 subjects aged 25 years and above from two separate studies respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Validating this score using the first data from the second screening study gave an area under the receive operator characteristics curve [AROC] of 0.758 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cut point of 4 had a sensitivity of 47.0% and specificity of 88% and in the second data AROC is 0.7 with 44% sensitivity and 89% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk score, based on a set of variables can be used for the identification of high risk individuals for early intervention to delay or prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pakistani population </plain></SENT>
