<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Ninety-one Brazilians with type 2 DM and generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> were involved in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical examination included full-mouth assessment of plaque index (PI), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> on probing (BoP), probing depth (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), suppuration (SUP), clinical attachment level (CAL) and number of remaining teeth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood analyses were carried out for glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>, defined as the percentage of sites with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and CAL≥5 mm, and glycemic parameters were also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, clinical parameters were compared amongst four (HbA1c levels ≤7.5%, 7.6-9%, 9.1-11% and &gt;11%) and two (&lt;9% and ≥9%) glycemic subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of uncontrolled diabetic subjects (HbA1c&gt;7.5%) was higher than well-controlled subjects (HbA1c≤7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amongst the clinical parameters evaluated, only PI was positively correlated with the levels of HbA1c and FPG (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of remaining teeth was negatively associated with the levels of HbA1c (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, PI was significantly higher in subjects presenting HbA1c levels &gt;11% and ≥9% than those with HbA1c levels ≤7.5% and &lt;9%, respectively (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although an increased frequency of the subjects with generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> included presented type 2 uncontrolled DM, a dose-response relationship between the severity and extension of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> and the glycemic control was not established in these subjects </plain></SENT>
