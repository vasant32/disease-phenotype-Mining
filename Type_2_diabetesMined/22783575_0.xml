<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to characterize the relationship between the adipose tissue fatty acid compositions and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the fatty acid compositions of subcutaneous adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These analyses were carried out on samples from 76 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 98 diabetic adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adipose tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> composition of diabetic subjects (24.9% +/- 0.3) was significantly higher (p = 0.01) than in the controls (23.3% +/- 1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant negative correlation (r = -0.276, p = 0.001) was found between adipose tissue <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (PUFAs) and the Chol/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subjects studied (controls plus diabetic patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar negative correlation (r = -0.429, p = 0.001) was identified only for control group, whereas no significant correlation (p &gt; 0.05) was found for diabetic populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between fatty acid compositions and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles (TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, Chol/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> proportion) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) with HbAlc concentrations of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and controls was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> in adipose tissue may increase the risk of the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and it seems that a high intake of PUFAs can lead to lowering of the Chol/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
