<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have reported that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is associated with a significant increase in the adjusted risks of major macrovascular events, major microvascular events, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> can also have serious implications for patient health, psychological well being, and adherence to treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycemic events can impact the health economics of the patient, their employer, and third-party payers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment is a key predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, with one large population-based study reporting an overall prevalence of 7.1% (type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>) and 7.3% (type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>) in insulin-treated patients, compared with 0.8% in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> typically experience symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> on average twice weekly and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> once annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progressive loss of islet cell function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> results in a higher risk of both symptomatic and unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who become hypoglycemic are also more susceptible to developing defective counter-regulation, also known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> awareness <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e>, which is life-threatening and must be aggressively addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients unable to recognize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> symptoms, frequent home monitoring or use of continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensors are critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary care physicians play a key role in the prevention and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in those requiring intensive insulin therapy, yet physicians are often unaware of the multitude of consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or how to deal with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Careful monitoring, adherence to guidelines, and use of optimal treatment combinations are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> important steps toward improving care in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most important goals are for primary care physicians to recognize that every patient treated with antihyperglycemic medications is at risk of iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and to ask patients about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> at every visit </plain></SENT>
