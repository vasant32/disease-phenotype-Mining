<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of a total population of 3,755,038 individuals aged 31-90 years at the end of 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained retrospectively from electronic clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 286,791 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified (7.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four percent were men, mean (SD) age was 68.2 (11.4) years, and mean duration of disease was 6.5 (5.1) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) A1C value was 7.15 (1.5)%, and 56% of the patients had A1C values ≤7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) blood pressure (BP) values were 137.2 (13.8)/76.4 (8.3) mmHg, mean total cholesterol concentration was 192 (38.6) mg/dL, mean <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration was 49.3 (13.2) mg/dL, mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) concentration was 112.5 (32.4) mg/dL, and mean BMI was 29.6 (5) kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one percent of the patients had BP values ≤130/80 mmHg, 37.9% had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> values ≤100 mg/dL, and 45.4% had BMI values ≤30 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two percent were managed exclusively with lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding medicated diabetic patients, 46.9, 22.9, and 2.8% were prescribed one, two, or three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, respectively, and 23.4% received insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study indicate a similar or improved control of glycemia, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and BP in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when compared with previous studies performed in Spain and elsewhere </plain></SENT>
