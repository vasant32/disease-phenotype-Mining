<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects studied to date the nonhuman primate has been shown to develop the same disease with the same features that develop in overweight middle-aged humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This includes the progressive development of the known complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are extraordinarily like those identified in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, for the development and evaluation of new therapeutic agents, the translation of findings from nonhuman primates to application in humans has been highly predictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both therapeutic efficacy and identification of potential adverse responses can be effectively examined in nonhuman primates due to their great similarity to humans at the molecular, biochemical, and physiological levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This chapter provides guidance for the development and management of a colony of monkeys with naturally occurring type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
