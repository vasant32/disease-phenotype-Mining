<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods:  This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 54-week study conducted at 41 sites in North and South America, Europe, and Asia in 278 patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1C) ≥7.5% to ≤11.0% despite ongoing combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (≥1500 mg/d) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (≥4 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg or placebo once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was change from baseline in A1C at Week 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results:  Mean baseline A1C was 8.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean placebo-adjusted change from baseline in A1C with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment was -0.7% (P&lt;0.001) at Week 18 and -0.8% (P&lt;0.001) at Week 54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant (P&lt;0.001) reductions also in 2-hour postmeal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> compared with placebo at Weeks 18 and 54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher proportions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>-treated than placebo-treated patients had A1C &lt;7.0% at Weeks 18 (22% versus 9%; P=0.003) and 54 (26% versus 14%; P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in body weight and rates of adverse events overall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, and gastrointestinal adverse events were similar in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and placebo groups during the 54-week study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> for 54 weeks to ongoing therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> improved glycemic control and was generally well tolerated compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
