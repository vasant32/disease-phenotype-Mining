<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To estimate the current and future economic burdens of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A top-down approach was used to estimate costs for 2010/2011 from aggregated data sets and literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence and population data were used to project costs for 2035/2036 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct health costs were estimated from data on diagnosis, lifestyle interventions, ongoing treatment and management, and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indirect costs were estimated from data on mortality, sickness, presenteeism (potential loss of productivity among people who remain in work) and informal care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> cost approximately £ 23.7bn in the UK in 2010/2011: £ 9.8bn in direct costs (£1bn for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and £ 8.8bn for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and £ 13.9bn in indirect costs (£ 0.9bn and £ 13bn) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In real terms, the 2035/2036 cost is estimated at £ 39.8bn: £ 16.9bn in direct costs (£ 1.8bn for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and £ 15.1bn for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and £ 22.9bn in indirect costs (£ 2.4bn and £ 20.5bn) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis applied to the direct costs produced a range of costs: between £ 7.9bn and £ 11.7bn in 2010/2011 and between £ 13.8bn and £20bn in 2035/2036 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> currently accounts for approximately 10% of the total health resource expenditure and is projected to account for around 17% in 2035/2036 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are prominent diseases in the UK and are a significant economic burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data differentiating between the costs of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications related to the diseases account for a substantial proportion of the direct health costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As prevalence increases, the cost of treating complications will grow if current care regimes are maintained </plain></SENT>
