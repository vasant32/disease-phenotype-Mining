<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether plasma adrenomedullin is involved in the previously reported significant inverse correlation between left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (peak velocity of early transmitral flow/peak velocity of early diastolic mitral annular motion ratio [E/E' ]) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, mild-to-moderate renal function impairment and LV relaxation impairment (E' â‰¤ 7.1 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma adrenomedullin concentration, E/E' and eGFR were assessed in 82 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma adrenomedullin concentration was positively correlated with eGFR in patients with or without LV relaxation impairment, and inversely correlated with E/E' in patients with LV relaxation impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis supported a role for plasma adrenomedullin in the association between E/E' and eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that adrenomedullin modulates the interaction between the heart and kidneys in early subclinical cardiorenal syndrome in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
