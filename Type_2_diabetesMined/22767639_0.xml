<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, conflicting data have been reported on the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's syndrome</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of unsuspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's syndrome</z:e> among outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design and Setting: This was a cross-sectional prospective study in 24 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics across Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients: Between June 2006 and April 2008, 813 patients with known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>hypercortisolism</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of the study was closed in September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were not selected for characteristics conferring a higher pretest probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>hypercortisolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a first screening step with the 1-mg overnight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> suppression test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: Forty patients failed to suppress serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> less than 5.0 μg/dl (138 nmol/liter) and underwent a standard 2-d, 2-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> suppression test, after which six patients (0.6% of the overall series) failed to suppress <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> less than 1.8 μg/dl (50 nmol/liter), receiving a definitive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's syndrome</z:e> that was adrenal dependent in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients were cured, being able to discontinue, or reduce, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The present data do not support widespread screening of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's syndrome</z:e>; however, the disorder is less rare than previously thought when considering epidemiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results support a case-finding approach in patients with uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> despite appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
