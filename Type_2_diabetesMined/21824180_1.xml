<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> is common in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, has a strong negative impact on the quality of life of patients and is associated with poor outcomes and higher mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several guidelines encourage screening of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> screening tools are currently being used in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and which are most appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to examine which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> screening instruments are currently being used in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> research, and the operating characteristics of these tools in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Literature searches for the period January 1970 to October 2010 were conducted using MEDLINE, PSYCH-INFO, ASSIA, SCOPUS, ACADEMIC SEARCH COMPLETE, CINAHL and SCIENCE DIRECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data are presented for the 234 published studies that were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale were the most popular screening tools (used in 24% and 21% of studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Information on the cultural applicability of screening tools was mostly unavailable and, where reported, included only details of the language translation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A small number of studies reported reliability data, most of which showed moderate-good sensitivity and specificity but a high rate of false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although a range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> screening tools have been used in research, there remains few data on their reliability and validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Information on the cultural applicability of these instruments is even scantier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research is required in order to determine the suitability of screening tools for use in clinical practice and to address the increasing problem of co-morbid <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
