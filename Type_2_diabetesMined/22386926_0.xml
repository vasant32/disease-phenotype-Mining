<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate physicians' attitudes about referring patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Physicians were identified from the Pennsylvania Integrated Clinical and Administrative Research Database and other databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians at an academic medical center (n = 142) and community-based physicians (n = 197) in the Philadelphia area in specialties likely to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were sent a survey about their perceptions of the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery as a treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the physicians, 93 returned the survey, for a combined response rate of 27.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respondents reported having positive impressions of bariatric surgery as a treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (79.6% and 67.4%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 20.8% of respondents indicated that they would be likely to refer their patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a body mass index of 30-34.9 kg/m(2) to a randomized research trial of bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In general, physicians who treat patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had favorable impressions about bariatric surgery as a treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, only a few were willing to refer their patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a body mass index of 30-34.9 kg/m(2) to randomized research trials of bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reluctance to refer patients represents an important barrier to the successful completion of studies of the efficacy of bariatric surgery for those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a body mass index &lt;35 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
