<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 2003 and June 2010, the ABI was determined in 3924 outpatients attending the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Center of the People's Liberation Army 306th Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, demographic and laboratory data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for an abnormal ABI were determined using univariate and stepwise logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ABI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (0.91-1.3) in 93.1% of patients, low (&lt;0.9) in 5.2%, and high (&gt;1.3) in 1.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of abnormal lower ABI was greater in elderly (â‰¥ 65 years) patients (12.2%) than in younger (&lt; 65 years) patients (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI as the reference, low ABI in younger patients was found to be independently associated with HbA1c, the urinary albumin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A low ABI in elderly patients was found to be independently associated with age, smoking, HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A high ABI in younger patients was associated with being male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of an abnormal ABI was high in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early identification and intensive treatment are needed to improve the quality of life and overall prognosis of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
