<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effect of vildagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on glycemic control and β-cell function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-one type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, naive to antidiabetes therapy and with poor glycemic control, were instructed to take <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for 8±2 months up to a mean dosage of 2,500±500 mg/day; then they were randomly assigned to add vildaglipin 50 mg twice a day or placebo for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months: body mass index, glycemic control, fasting plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment β-cell function index (HOMA-β), fasting plasma proinsulin, proinsulin/fasting plasma insulin ratio, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon, adiponectin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and at 12 months after the addition of vildagliptin, patients underwent a combined euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp, with subsequent arginine stimulation, to assess insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, vildagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> gave a better decrease of body weight, glycemic control, HOMA-IR, and glucagon and a better increase of HOMA-β compared with placebo + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding the measures of β-cell function, treatment-induced changes in M-value, first- and second-phase C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response to arginine were significantly higher in the vildagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group compared with the placebo + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of vildagliptin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> gave a better improvement of glycemic control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and β-cell function compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
