<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive research was conducted to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case-control or cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fixed or random effect pooled measure was selected based on the homogeneity test among studies that was evaluated with I(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-regression was used to explore the potential sources of between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Publication bias was estimated using Peters test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine articles were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, after excluding articles deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls and sensitive analysis, no significant association was found between RAGE gene polymorphisms (Gly82Ser, 1704G/T, 429T/C) and any of T2DM, DR and DN risk, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity (Asian and Caucasian) also found no significant association between the above-mentioned three polymorphisms and T2DM risk, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis suggested that there might be no association of RAGE gene polymorphisms (Gly82Ser, 1704G/T, 429T/C) with T2DM, DR and DN risk </plain></SENT>
