<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent developments suggest that local delivery of antimicrobials into periodontal pockets improve periodontal health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the adjunctive effects of subgingivally delivered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">Azithromycin</z:chebi> (AZM) (0.5% concentration) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: 63 patients were categorized into two treatment groups: Group 1: SRP plus placebo gel and Group 2: SRP plus 0.5% AZM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months; they included marginal sulcus <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> index (mSBI), plaque index (PI), probing depth (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), and clinical attachment level (CAL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Both therapies resulted in significant improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a subject based analysis, patients in Group 2 treated with SRP + 0.5 %AZM showed enhanced reductions in PI, GI, SBI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and gains in CAL (p &lt;0.05) over a period of 9 months as compared to Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Although both treatment strategies seemed to benefit the patients, the adjunctive use of 0.5% AZM as a controlled drug delivery system enhanced the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
