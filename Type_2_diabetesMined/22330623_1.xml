<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study enrolled 287 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was quantified by ultrasonography as carotid intima-media thickness (CITM), plaque score from 0 to 6 and plaque type from 1 to 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level was observed in patients with MnSOD Val/Val genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other polymorphisms did not show significant association with clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not observe significant differences in MnSOD, GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes distribution according to CIMT, plaque type or plaque score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, BMI, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> carriers of GSTT1-0 genotype showed an increased risk for higher plaque score (OR=2.29; p=0.012), but no association with CIMT and plaque stability was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carrying of both GSTM1-0 and GSTT1-0 did not influence clinical parameters but increased risk for higher plaque score (OR=2.59; P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We did not find a significant association between the MnSOD, GSTM1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The GSTT1-0 genotype and GSTT1-0/GSTM1-0 haplotype might be a potential determinants of susceptibility to advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
