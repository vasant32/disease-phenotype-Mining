<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of thiazolidinedione on liver functions has been controversial in different studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on liver enzymes in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 4 mg daily were enrolled in this 3-month study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two of them had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function (NLF), and 31 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> (ABLF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood biochemistries were collected monthly during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, other than age and liver enzymes, there were no differences in body mass index, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c), and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles between the NLF and ABLF groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the treatment, HbA1c was lowered in both groups, but only significantly in the ABLF group (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, serum concentrations of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the ABLF group decreased significantly (AST: 57.8 ± 26.5 to 47.5 ± 20.2 U/L, P = 0.006; ALT 66.6 ± 35.0 to 51.9 ± 23.5 UL, P = 0.004), while in the NLF group, a similar change was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After 3-month <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with mildly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated liver enzymes</z:hpo>, significant improvement in AST and ALT were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study provides some hints that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> might not be contraindicated in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> as previously thought, but further well-designed studies are necessary to clarify this issue </plain></SENT>
