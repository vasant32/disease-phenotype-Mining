<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A focus group interview was conducted and questionnaires were collected from outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paired sample t-tests, importance-performance gap analysis and regression analysis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perseverance was the key factor affecting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring and regular exercise; the association was stronger in men than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The critical factor in diet control was the desire to eat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' perceived severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and limited daily activities due to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> correlated with regular exercise, patients' compliance correlated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring, and perceived health status correlated with diet control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cultivation of perseverance and strengthening psychological coping is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Health professionals should design tailored services, avoid didactic intervention education programmes, and develop a 'meaning-centred' rather than a 'message-centred' philosophy of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a campaign may help to improve self-management and promote health behaviours for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
