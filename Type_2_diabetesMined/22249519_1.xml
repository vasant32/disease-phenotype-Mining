<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the past decade, improved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development has resulted in advances in therapeutic concepts, but has also supported the potential for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention through nonpharmacological means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of the century, we experienced a shift in paradigm, as landmark studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is preventable with lifestyle intervention; moderate changes in diet and physical activity produce a substantial and sustained reduction in the incidence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) for individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This evidence must now be translated into clinical and public-health practice, but translational studies have varied in their ability to replicate the results of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This variation reflects a number of challenging barriers for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention in real-world clinical practice, which makes it necessary to focus on identifying efficient intervention methods and delivery mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Research is now focusing on these mechanisms, as well as on developing efficient screening and risk-identification strategies and realistic scenarios for public-health policy to implement <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this Review, we will discuss these mechanisms and will consider the implications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention for public-health strategy and policy </plain></SENT>
