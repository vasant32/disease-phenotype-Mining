<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that included new data from previously unpublished studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a nested case-cohort design in the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EPIC)-Norfolk study, we identified a random subcohort and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases occurring between baseline (1993-1997) and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Ely prospective study we identified incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases between 1990 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review of prospective studies on 25(OH)D and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> published in MEDLINE or EMBASE until 31 January 2012, and performed a random-effects meta-analysis combining available evidence with results from the EPIC-Norfolk and Ely studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In EPIC-Norfolk, baseline 25(OH)D was lower among incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases (mean [SD] 61.6 [22.4] nmol/l; n=621) vs non-case subcohort participants (mean 65.3 [23.9] nmol/l; n=826) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse association between baseline 25(OH)D and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in multivariable-adjusted analyses: HR (95% CI) 0.66 (0.45, 0.97), 0.53 (0.34, 0.82), 0.50 (0.32, 0.76), p trend &lt;0.001, comparing consecutive increasing 25(OH)D quartiles with the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Ely, 37 incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were identified among 777 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In meta-analysis, the combined RR of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> comparing the highest with lowest quartile of 25(OH)D was 0.59 (0.52, 0.67), with little <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (I (2)â€‰=2.7%, p=0.42) between the 11 studies included (3,612 cases and 55,713 non-cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings demonstrate an inverse association between circulating 25(OH)D and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, causal inference should be addressed through adequately dosed randomised trials of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation or genetic Mendelian randomisation experiments </plain></SENT>
