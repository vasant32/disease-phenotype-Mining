<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-helper (Th) cells play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether Th cells participate in the pathogenesis of DR remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate the role of Th cells in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, the concentrations of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 p70, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-22, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α in the serum of 29 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were measured with FlowCytomix Technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-22 levels in unstimulated and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were examined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the mean IL-22 serum levels were slightly lower in diabetic patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IL-22 level of PBMCs was significantly elevated in patients with proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> compared with the level in patients with non-proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, patients with non-DR, and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the IL-22 serum and PBMC levels were positively correlated with the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of other associated cytokines showed no significant change in diabetic patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a possible role of Th22 cells in DR, and IL-22 may be involved more in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> than in other stages of DR </plain></SENT>
