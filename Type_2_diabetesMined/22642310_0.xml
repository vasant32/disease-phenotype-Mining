<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">Retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein (RBP4) is an adipokine that may be important in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have examined the association between serum RBP4 concentrations and clinical indices in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although the results obtained have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a meta-analysis aiming to investigate the association between serum RBP4 concentrations and clinical indicators of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, renal function, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched from 2005 through November 2011, and the search identified 21 clinical variables from seven studies (total n = 1406) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each variable, summary correlation coefficients (r(s) ) were estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> markers were correlated with serum RBP4 concentrations in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the renal function markers and many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> markers were significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Summary correlation coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were -0.36 (95% CI = -0.51 to -0.18) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, -0.39 (95% CI = -0.44 to -0.33) for estimated glomerular filtration rate and 0.53 (95% CI = 0.30-0.71) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations (r(s) = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.11-0.32), plasma total cholesterol concentrations [r(s) = 0.14 (95% CI = 0.05-0.23)] and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> level (r(s) = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.02-0.25) were positively correlated with serum RBP4 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the present study suggest that serum RBP4 concentrations in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> and imbalances in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
