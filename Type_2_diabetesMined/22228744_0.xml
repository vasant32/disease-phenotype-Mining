<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the pattern of relationships between the 17-item <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Distress Scale (DDS17) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variables to establish scale cut points for high distress among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Recruited were 506 study 1 and 392 study 2 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from community medical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression equations associated the DDS17, a 17-item scale that yields a mean-item score, with HbA(1c), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-efficacy, diet, and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations also were undertaken for the two-item DDS (DDS2) screener </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses included control variables, linear, and quadratic (curvilinear) DDS terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant quadratic effects occurred between the DDS17 and each <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variable, with increases in distress associated with poorer outcomes: study 1 HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.02), self-efficacy (P &lt; 0.001), diet (P &lt; 0.001), physical activity (P &lt; 0.04); study 2 HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.03), self-efficacy (P &lt; 0.004), diet (P &lt; 0.04), physical activity (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Substantive curvilinear associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four variables in both studies began at unexpectedly low levels of DDS17: the slope increased linearly between scores 1 and 2, was more muted between 2 and 3, and reached a maximum between 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggested three patient subgroups: little or no distress, &lt;2.0; moderate distress, 2.0-2.9; high distress, â‰¥3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parallel findings occurred for the DDS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In two samples of type 2 diabetic patients we found a consistent pattern of curvilinear relationships between the DDS and HbA(1c), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-efficacy, diet, and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The shape of these relationships suggests cut points for three patient groups: little or no, moderate, and high distress </plain></SENT>
