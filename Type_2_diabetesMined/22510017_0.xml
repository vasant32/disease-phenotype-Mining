<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe daytime non-severe hypoglycemic events (NSHEs), assess their impact on patient functioning and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management, and examine if these impacts differ by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type or country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Internet survey to adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the US, UK, Germany, and France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 6756 screened respondents, 2439 reported a daytime NSHE in the past month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NSHEs occurred while active (e.g., running errands) (45.1%), 29.6% while not active (e.g., watching TV), and 23.8% at work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On average, it took half a day to respond and recover from NSHE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respondents monitored their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 5.7 extra times on average over the following week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the day of event, type 1 respondents tested significantly more often than type 2 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2 were less likely to confirm NSHE with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following NSHE, 12.6% of respondents reduced total insulin by an average of 7.6 units (SD=8.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total units and days with reduced dosing was significantly less, whilst number of additional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tests and time to recover was significantly longer if NSHE occurred at work (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type 1 decreased insulin doses more often (p&lt;0.001); however, type 2 decreased a greater number of units (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with other countries, US respondents were more likely to eat a light or full meal and respondents in France took significantly longer than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other countries to recognize (p&lt;0.05), respond to (p&lt;0.001), and recover from (p&lt;0.001) NSHE, used significantly more monitoring tests the day of (p&lt;0.05) and over the subsequent week (p&lt;0.001), and decreased their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin dose more (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Limitations of the study include potential recall bias and selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NSHEs are associated with a significant impact on patient functioning and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
