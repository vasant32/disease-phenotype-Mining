<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that the correlation between autoantibody specificity for the ZnT8 Arg325Trp isoforms and the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated rs13266634 may affect β-cell function at type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1D) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study this, we tested 482 newly diagnosed diabetic probands and 478 healthy siblings from the Danish population-based T1D registry for autoantibodies to ZnT8 (ZnT8A) in addition to GAD65 and IA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and titres of autoantibodies were correlated with genotypes for rs13266634 and HLA-DQB1, age at diagnosis (AAD) and insulin dose-adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c), as a proxy for residual β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We replicated the correlation between rs13266634 genotypes and specificity for the ZnT8-Argenine (ZnT8R) and ZnT8-Tryptophan (ZnT8W) isoforms previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ZnT8A overlapped substantially with autoantibodies to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> decarboxylase 65 (GADA) and IA-2 (IA-2A) and correlated significantly with IA-2A prevalence (p &lt; 2e-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No effect on IDAA1c was demonstrated for ZnT8A or rs13266634 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a correlation between ZnT8R positivity and HLA-DQB1*0302 genotypes (p = 0.016), which has not been shown previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significantly lower ZnT8R and GADA prevalence and titres was found among probands with AAD &lt; 5 years (prevalence: p = 0.004 and p = 0.0001; titres: p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same trend was observed for IA-2A and ZnT8W; however, the difference was non-significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms ZnT8 as a major target for autoantibodies at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in our Danish T1D cohort of children and adolescents, and we have further characterised the relationship between autoantibody specificity for the ZnT8 Arg325Trp <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> and rs13266634 in relation to established autoantibodies, AAD, measures of β-cell function and HLA-DQB1 genotypes in T1D </plain></SENT>
