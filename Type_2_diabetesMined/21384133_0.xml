<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> on protein damage by glycation, oxidation and nitration in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a double-masked randomised crossover trial of 52 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment was replaced with bendroflumethiazide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2-months wash-out, patients were treated randomly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> 300, 600, and 900 mg o.d., each dose for 2 months in a three-way crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycation, oxidation and nitration adduct residues in plasma protein and related urinary free adducts were determined by stable isotopic dilution analysis liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> decreased urinary excretion of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs)--<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">methylglyoxal</z:chebi>- and glyoxal-derived hydroimidazolones, MG-H1 and G-H1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urinary AGEs were decreased by 30-32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In plasma protein, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> increased content of glycation adducts Nε-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24109">fructosyl-lysine</z:chebi>, AGEs Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine, Nε-carboxyethyl-lysine and pentosidine, and also increased content of oxidation markers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18377,30249">N-formylkynurenine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50607">dityrosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was attributed to decreased clearance of plasma protein modified by Nε-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24109">fructosyl-lysine</z:chebi> and oxidative markers through the glomerular filter tightened by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> decreased urinary excretion of MG-H1, G-H1 and 3-NT, which may result from decreased exposure to these AGEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is likely achieved by blocking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> signalling and related down-regulation of glyoxalase 1 and may contribute to health benefits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
