<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified ten previously unreported T2D susceptibility loci, including two showing sex-differentiated association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide analyses of these data are consistent with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002758'>long tail</z:mp> of additional common variant loci explaining much of the variation in susceptibility to T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exploration of the enlarged set of susceptibility loci implicates several processes, including CREBBP-related transcription, adipocytokine signaling and cell cycle regulation, in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
