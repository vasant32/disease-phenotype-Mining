<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: δ-ALA-D activity and reactivation index, as well as markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, biochemical and anthropometrics parameters were determined in T2DM (n=23), type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (T2DM/HT) (n=30) and controls (n=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T2DM/HT presented a greater inhibition of δ-ALA-D activity, a higher reactivation index (p&lt;0.05) and a greater <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of plasma protein <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">thiol groups</z:chebi> (P-SH) when compared to T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, δ-ALA-D activity was positively associated with SH groups and negatively associated with serum protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> (PC) while its reactivation index was negatively associated with SH groups and positively associated with PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results point out that there is a possible interference of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on the mechanism of the δ-ALA-D activity suggesting that this condition aggravated the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
