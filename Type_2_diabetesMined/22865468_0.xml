<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Our objective was to investigate the association between C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and lifestyle factors in a national sample of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study analyzed data from 1,086 men and women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who completed the 1999-2004 NHANES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle factors included diet quality, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stratified logistic regression showed that for both men and women, BMI was a strong predictor of elevated CRP after adjusting for age, energy intake, race/ethnicity, medications, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, among men, but not among women, the likelihood of elevated CRP increased with lower diet quality and physical inactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, higher levels of CRP were associated with lower diet quality and physical inactivity among men, and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> among both men and women </plain></SENT>
