<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the association between exposure to <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> in drinking water and the occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Middle Banat region, Serbia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study comprised two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposed population in Middle Banat region consumes drinking water with <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> (mean=56μg/L); unexposed population from six regions in Central Serbia consumes <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> below detection limit (2μg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Newly diagnosed cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were obtained from the National Registry of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Registry included age, gender, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, presence of overweight, central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reported in years 2006, 2007 and 2009 was used to calculate standardized incidence rates for both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two populations were comparable by age, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and prevalence of overweight persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unexposed population was more likely to have central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and high total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Standardized incidence rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were higher in exposed population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly higher for the exposed population, both men and women, in the period from 2006 to 2009, when compared with the unexposed population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The population from Middle Banat region, consuming drinking water with low levels of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi>, was at higher risk for the occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in comparison to the unexposed population in Central Serbia </plain></SENT>
