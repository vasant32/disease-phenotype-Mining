<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A computerized database of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 30 years old and older (n=4805) enrolled in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care Management Program of a medical center before 2006 was analyzed using a time-dependent Cox's proportional hazards regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates for the first, second, and third tertiles of the first annual FPG-CV were 8.64, 12.71, and 30.82 per 1000 person-years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for mean FPG, HbA1c, and other risk factors, the annual FPG-CV was independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence or mortality, and the corresponding hazard ratios for the third vs first tertile of the annual FPG-CV were 3.03 (1.98, 4.65), 5.04 (2.32, 10.94), and 2.86 (1.91, 4.29) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The annual variation in FPG was a strong predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality in type 2 diabetic patients; therefore, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variation may be important in the clinical practice of care management and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
