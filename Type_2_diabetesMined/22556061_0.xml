<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was induced in rats by feeding high-fat diet for 2 weeks followed by single intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> 35 mg/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic rats were treated with SA orally at a dosage of 200 mg/kg body weight daily for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> (500 mg/kg body weight, orally) was used as a reference drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SA significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and decreased the levels of HbA1c and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SA treatment significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased the increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> were restored to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels when compared with control diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histopathological abnormalities were also found to be normalized after treatment with SA nut milk extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential antihyperglycemic action of SA is plausibly due to its underlying <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> role </plain></SENT>
