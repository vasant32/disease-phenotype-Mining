<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is common during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and aging in both animals and people, progression to T2D is largely due to insulin secretory dysfunction and significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of functional β-cells, leading to an inability to compensate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is recognized that environmental factors and nutrition play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, our knowledge surrounding molecular mechanisms by which these factors trigger β-cell dysfunction and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent discoveries raise the possibility that epigenetic changes in response to environmental stimuli may play an important role in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review emerging knowledge regarding epigenetic mechanisms that may be involved in β-cell dysfunction and pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including the role of nutrition, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We will mainly focus on the role of DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications but will also briefly review data on miRNA effects on the pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies aimed at better understanding how epigenetic regulation of gene expression controls β-cell function may reveal potential therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
