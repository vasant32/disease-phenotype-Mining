<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) versus standard medical management (SMM) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from a UK healthcare payer perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A validated computer model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was used to project outcomes reported from a randomized clinical trial of LAGB versus SMM in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-year follow-up data from the trial were projected over a 40-year time horizon and cost-effectiveness was assessed from the perspective of the National Health Service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> costs were reported in 2010 pounds sterling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A series of sensitivity analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LAGB was associated with benefits in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, body mass index and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations, which led to significant increases in discounted life expectancy (an increase of 0.64 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (an increase of 0.92 quality-adjusted life years) and reduced incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications relative to SMM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment costs in the LAGB arm increased by GBP 4,552, but this was partially offset by cost savings resulting from a reduction in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> modeled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 3,602 per QALY in the base case fell well below commonly-quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the UK setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from a recent randomized controlled trial, LAGB is likely to be considered cost-effective from the healthcare payer perspective when compared with SMM of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the UK setting </plain></SENT>
