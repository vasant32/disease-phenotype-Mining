<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the factors associated with the progression of this complication in elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study of a subgroup of patients registered with the Japanese Elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Trial included 621 Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (age â‰¥ 65 years, 346 with normoalbuminuria, 190 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and 85 with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model with a backward stepwise procedure was applied to select factors with significant effects on worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> stage and the doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow up (median 52 months), 21% of patients progressed from normoalbuminuria and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> to a worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aging, female sex and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> were identified as independent and significant factors that worsen <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, 6.1% of patients showed doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> and conventional therapy were identified as significant factors involved in the doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of the doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> was significantly lower in the intensive therapy group than the conventional therapy group (P = 0.016), although that of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> stage was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified several factors associated with the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that multiple risk factor intervention seems important in preventing deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
