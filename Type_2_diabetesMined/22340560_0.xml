<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) has been successfully applied to study intracellular membrane compounds and high-energy phosphate metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the capability of dynamic (31)P-MRS for assessing energy metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dynamic (31)P-MRS was performed on 22 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 26 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spectra were acquired from quadriceps muscle while subjects were in a state of rest, at exercise and during recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peak areas of inorganic phosphate (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>), phosphocreatine (PCr), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) and the intracellular pH value were calculated from the biochemistry reaction equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time constant and recovery rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>, PCr, and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> were analyzed using exponential curve fitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared to healthy controls, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients had significantly lower skeletal muscle concentrations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>, PCr and β-ATP, and higher levels of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>/PCr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During exercise, diabetics experienced a significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> peak increase and PCr peak decrease, and once the exercise was completed both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> and PCr peaks returned to resting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quantitatively, the mean recovery rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> and PCr in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were (10.74 ± 1.26) mmol/s and (4.74 ± 2.36) mmol/s, respectively, which was significantly higher than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive quantitative (31)P-MRS is able to detect energy metabolism inefficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function impairment in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
