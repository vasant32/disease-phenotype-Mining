<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE:: While the benefits of exercise in people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is well-known, knowledge of factors associated with dropouts of exercise intervention trials is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examining clinical and psychosocial factors related to dropout is a necessary first step to developing effective exercise program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the predictors of a randomized trial of exercise intervention dropout among sedentary individuals with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Participants (n = 140) were randomly allocated to a 6-month, 3 times per week exercise intervention, or to a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Psychological well-being was assessed using a 36-item Short Form, the Profile of Mood States questionnaire, and an Exercise Self-Efficacy scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total percent body fat and abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was assessed with the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fitness was expressed as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> peak during treadmill testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: There were significantly more dropouts in the exercise group than in the control group (ρ = -0.220; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those who dropped out of the study had less exercise self-efficacy for lifting weight (ρ = 0.187; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters associated with dropouts included low fitness (ρ = 0.255; P &lt; .01), higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (ρ = 0.167; P &lt; .05), higher total percent body fat (ρ = -0.213; P &lt; .05), and higher subcutaneous abdominal fat (ρ = -0.220; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the multiple logistic regression model, exercise group assignment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and fitness remained significant predictors of dropouts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Special attention to the sedentary individuals with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and poor fitness should be incorporated into implementing exercise programs to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment.In a randomized trial of an exercise intervention in 140 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, exercise group assignment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and fitness were significant predictors of study dropout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tailored counseling for individuals with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and poor fitness should be incorporated into implementing exercise programs to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
