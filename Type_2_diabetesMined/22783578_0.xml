<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups were investigated: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Routine patients come from outpatients, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Research subjects including 224 healthy volunteers and 391 diabetic patients, who had 5 blood specimens collected between February and June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In non-diabetic patients, mean HbA1c concentrations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> temperature categories were not significantly different, but mean FPG level was higher at cooler temperatures (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic group, mean HbA1c concentrations were higher at cool temperatures than at very cold temperatures (p &lt; 0.05), but mean FPG level was higher at cold temperature than at other temperature categories (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the within- and the between-subject coefficients of variation (CVs) for HbA1c were smaller than for FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During the year of this study, there were substantial temperature fluctuations but HbA1c concentration was more stable than FPG in non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is therefore unlikely that temperature-related variation in HbA1c could affect the use of HbA1c as a diagnostic test for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but could affect the use of HbA1c as a glycemia control test for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
