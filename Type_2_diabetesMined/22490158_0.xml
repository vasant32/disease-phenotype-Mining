<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 533 female type 2 diabetics were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And their clinicobiochemical parameters were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response (ACPR) were measured by a stimulation of arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 262 patients received the examinations of OGTT (oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test), area under the curve of insulin (AUC-insulin) and C <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (AUC-C <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> &gt; 360 µmol/L was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> and control groups were (430 ± 8) and (248 ± 3) µmol/L respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AIR, ACPR, AUC-insulin and AUC-C <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> group than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation between serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> and AIR, ACPR, AUC-insulin and AUC-C <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (r = 0.194, P &lt; 0.01; r = 0.146, P &lt; 0.01; r = 0.307, P &lt; 0.01 and r = 0.420, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> were significantly different between tertile groups of AIR (260 ± 7), (264 ± 8), (302 ± 7) µmol/L, ACPR ((263 ± 8), (271 ± 7), (296 ± 7) µmol/L), AUC-insulin ((241 ± 10), (279 ± 10), (301 ± 8) µmol/L) and AUC-C <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ((229 ± 8), (265 ± 9), (326 ± 10) µmol/L, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression demonstrated that the serum level of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> were associated with AIR (β = 0.002, 95%CI 0.0010 - 0.0030, P &lt; 0.01), ACPR (β = 0.001, 95%CI 0.0002 - 0.0020, P = 0.02), AUC-insulin (β = 0.002, 95%CI 0.0004 - 0.0030, P &lt; 0.01) and AUC-C <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (β = 0.003, 95%CI 0.0020 - 0.0030, P &lt; 0.01) after an adjustment of related risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The serum level of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> is significantly correlated with AIR, ACPR, AUC-insulin and AUC-C <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in female type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>And it may be an independent risk factor of predicting islet beta cell functions in female type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
