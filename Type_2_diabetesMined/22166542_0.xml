<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its pathogenesis is complex and has been connected with a state of preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (VIP) and its receptors play a relevant role in the homeostasis of insulin secretion as well as in the control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, VIP receptor 1 (VPAC1) has been found to be down-modulated during <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and to be associated with several diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare the distribution of SNPs mapping in the VIP receptor 1 gene in cases with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred cases with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (423 males and 277 females) and 830 random controls (419 males and 411 females) were analyzed for the distribution of three common SNPs mapping in the VPAC1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show a significantly different genotype distribution of the SNP rs9677 in the 3'-UTR of VPAC1 in female cases with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to gender-matched controls (ptrend=6Ã—10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rs9677 CC genotype confers the highest risk (OR: 2.1) and correlates with worse clinical parameters such as higher level of total cholesterol, higher <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> ratio and a higher HbA1c concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genetic association reported here indicates that VIP/VPAC1 signaling can be a relevant pathway in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in females suggesting that at least some aspects of the genetic predisposition to this disease can be gender-specific </plain></SENT>
