<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> admitted for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control were grouped according to their fasting and 2-h postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequency and severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, number of carotid artery plaques, coefficient of variation of R-R intervals (CVRR), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), intima-media thickness, brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level, ankle-brachial index, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 206 patients studied, mean ± SD age, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 63.4 ± 13.7 years, 9.8 ± 1.8% and 13.4 ± 8.9 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with high fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels had a higher frequency of proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> than those with low fasting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with medium or high 2-h postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels had higher baPWV and lower CVRR, respectively, than those with low 2-h levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation between baPWV and CVRR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels are risk factors for vascular complications in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
