<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between lung function and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Korean men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 9,220 men (mean age: 41.4 years) without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline who were followed for five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into four groups according to baseline forced vital capacity (FVC) (% predicted) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (% predicted) quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at follow-up was compared according to FVC and FEV1 quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced lung function was significantly associated with the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjusting for age, BMI, education, smoking, exercise, alcohol, and HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both FVC and FEV1 were negatively associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with BMI &lt; 25, the lowest quartile of FVC and FEV1 had a significantly higher odds ratio for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the highest quartile after adjusting for age and BMI (2.15 [95% CI 1.02-4.57] and 2.19 [95% CI 1.09-4.42]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced lung function is independently associated with the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Korean men </plain></SENT>
