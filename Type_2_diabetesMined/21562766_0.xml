<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the relationship between +405 G/C polymorphism and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in the diabetic population has not been sufficiently studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate for the first time the possible association between +405 G/C polymorphism and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in an population from Tehran of Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 255 consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (Group A) and 235 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and normoalbuminuria (Group B) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to detect the VEGF alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, the groups were statistically similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables except for HbA1c (8.53 ± 1.7 in Group A vs. 8.2 ± 1.73 in Group B; P = 0.034), 24-h urinary albumin (201.33 ± 84.8 in Group A vs. 22.88 ± 3.5 in Group B; P &lt; 0.001), and the frequency of GG genotype (31% in Group A vs. 18.7% in Group B; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GG genotype was the independent predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> [P = 0.014, OR = 1.771, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.124-2.790] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that the G allele was not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, but the GG genotype in the VEGF gene is independently associated with development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in the our diabetic population </plain></SENT>
