<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations between serum allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) concentration, which is a marker of activated macrophages, and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum AIF-1 concentrations were measured in 284 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated relationships of serum AIF-1 concentrations to degree of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum AIF-1 concentrations positively correlated with logarithm of UAE (r=0.260, P&lt;0.0001), whereas serum AIF-1 concentrations inversely correlated with eGFR (r=-0.312, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean serum AIF-1 concentration was higher in patients with macroalbuminuria than that in patients with normoalbuminuria (P=0.0001) or that in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (P=0.0093) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate linear regression analyses, serum AIF-1 concentrations were independently correlated with logarithm of UAE (β=0.213, P=0.0120) and with eGFR (β=-0.286, P=0.0011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum AIF-1 concentration correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and eGFR in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and it could be a marker of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as well as activated macrophages </plain></SENT>
