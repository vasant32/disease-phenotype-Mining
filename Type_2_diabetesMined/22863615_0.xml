<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no information is available about an indicator of successful switching to liraglutide monotherapy from complex insulin therapy in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 69 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including 39 consecutive successful patients and 30 consecutive unsuccessful patients from insulin therapy to liraglutide monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before switching, we measured urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at 30, 60 and 120 min loading a test meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In successful patients, HbA(1c) and body weight were measured at 4, 8, and 12weeks after switching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using univariate analysis, duration of disease was significantly higher in unsuccessful patients than in successful patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were significantly higher in successful patients than in unsuccessful patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at 60 min was an independent predictor of successful switching to liraglutide monotherapy from insulin therapy (odds ratio, 7.28; 95% confidence interval, 2.89-18.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the receiver operating characteristic analyses, 2.9ng/mL of postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at 60 min was the best cut-off value, providing that sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 93%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up period, successful patients showed a sustained reduction in HbA(1c) and body weight without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at 60 min is a useful parameter in the prediction of successful switching from insulin therapy to liraglutide monotherapy in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
