<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of three polymorphisms of the eNOS gene (894G&gt;T, -786T&gt;C, and 27-bp-VNTR) with the risk of DN among type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 400 type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DN group comprised 200 patients; the group of diabetics without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> comprised another 200 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis for eNOS gene polymorphisms was done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C allele for -786T&gt;C and the T allele for 894G&gt;T were significantly more frequent in diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than in diabetics without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001; odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI] for the C allele=1.64 [1.24-2.17] and p&lt;0.001; OR and 95% CI=1.7 [1.27-2.26] for the T allele) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The haplotypes CTa (with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the mutant alleles) and CTb were significantly more common in patients with DN (p=0.01 and 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the eNOS polymorphisms might represent genetic determinants for developing DN in type 2 diabetic Egyptians </plain></SENT>
