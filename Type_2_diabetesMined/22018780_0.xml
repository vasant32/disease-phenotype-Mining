<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The serum N-terminal fragment of pro brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) level in type 2 diabetic subjects with or without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum NT-proBNP levels and different stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and identify probable factors predicting serum NT-proBNP level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 20 normoalbuminuric (Group-I), 28 microalbuminuric (Group-II), 20 macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients (Group-III), and 20 healthy volunteers (Group-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum NT-proBNP levels were measured with highly sensitive and specific immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean NT-proBNP levels were 32 ± 55, 91 ± 95, 331 ± 297, 42 ± 34 pg/ml for Groups I-IV, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When patients with LVH were excluded, mean logNT-proBNP was still significantly higher in Group-III than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three diabetic groups were similar in age, BMI, HbA1c, fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and GFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate linear regression model, adjusting for factors significantly correlated with NT-proBNP levels, the patient group, presence of LVH, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> remained as an independent predictor of serum NT-proBNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These variables explained 68% of the variability of NT-proBNP (adjusted R(2)=0.683) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mean serum NT-proBNP level of macroalbuminuric diabetic patients was higher than normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric diabetic patients, and healthy control subjects even after exclusion of LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP may be a useful and predictive marker of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
