<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a case-cohort study among 27,548 individuals within the population-based European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During 7 years of follow-up, 849 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 607 remained for analyses after exclusion of participants with missing data or abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sub-cohort of 2,500 individuals was randomly selected from the full cohort, comprising 1,969 individuals after applying the same exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, sports activity, bicycling, education, occupational activity, smoking habit, alcohol consumption and circulating levels of γ-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, fetuin-A, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and triacylglycerol, higher serum ferritin concentrations were associated with a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR in the highest vs lowest quintile, 1.73; 95% CI 1.15, 2.61; p (trend) = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed for soluble transferrin receptor (RR 1.33; 95% CI 0.85, 2.09; p (trend) = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The soluble transferrin receptor-to-ferritin ratio was significantly inversely related to risk (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41, 0.91; p (trend) = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High ferritin levels are associated with higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of established <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors and a range of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> biomarkers whereas soluble transferrin receptor concentrations are not related to risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that higher iron stores below the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018995" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemochromatosis</z:e> are associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
