<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that genes implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> pathways might be uncovered by accounting for differences in body mass index (BMI) and potential interactions between BMI and genetic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied a joint meta-analysis approach to test associations with fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on a genome-wide scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present six previously unknown loci associated with fasting insulin at P &lt; 5 × 10(-8) in combined discovery and follow-up analyses of 52 studies comprising up to 96,496 non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk variants were associated with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and lower <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol levels, suggesting a role for these loci in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The discovery of these loci will aid further characterization of the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in T2D pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
