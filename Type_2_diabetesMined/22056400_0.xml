<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and inadequate glycemic control were commenced on exenatide in an out-patient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects on Hba1c, weight and BMI at 3- and 6-month intervals were recorded by a retrospective review of medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We examined a cross-section of 61 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean weight at treatment initiation was 114 kg and baseline Hba1c was 9.8% (84 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean reduction in Hba1c at 3 months was 0.8% (10 mmol/mol, P &lt; 0.01) and mean reduction at 6 months was 0.5% (6 mmol/mol, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at 3 months was 4.2 kg (P &lt; 0.0001) and at 6 months was 6.6 kg (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients were prescribed exenatide in addition to insulin, against current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This cohort of patients showed a greater mean reduction in weight (7.4 vs 6.2 kg) as compared to the group on exenatide without insulin, but mean Hba1c increased at 6 months by 0.35% (4 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adjunctive exenatide treatment in patients with suboptimally controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on oral hypoglycaemic medications, achieved reductions in Hba1c and weight, in line with published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in patients already on insulin, favourable results can be achieved by the addition of exenatide by careful patient selection and follow-up </plain></SENT>
