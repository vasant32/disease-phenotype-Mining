<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized control trial in which 307 volunteers (intervention, n = 208; wait control, n = 99) diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> completed a six-session group-based intervention to promote healthier living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants' motivation to change, diet and exercise self-efficacy, mood, knowledge about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, activity levels, healthy eating, waist circumference, and weight were assessed before and after the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation in the program was associated with significant increases in healthy eating and physical activity, reductions in waist and weight, and improvements in motivation, positive mood, self-efficacy, and knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of the pathways to lifestyle change showed that the educational aspect of the program increased activity levels because it increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge and improved mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eating behavior was not mediated by any of the psychological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improvements in diet and physical activity were, in turn, directly associated with changes in weight and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the program significantly improved motivation, self-efficacy, and mood, its impact on knowledge uniquely explained the increase in physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group-based programs that are tailored to lifestyle behaviors may provide a cost-effective method of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention, but more research is needed to explain why they improve healthy eating </plain></SENT>
