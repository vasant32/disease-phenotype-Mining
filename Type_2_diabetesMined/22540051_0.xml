<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the fracture incidence and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> of type 2 diabetic female patients with those in a non-diabetic hypertensive cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The incidence of fracture in a type 2 diabetic cohort was compared with that in a non-diabetic hypertensive cohort over the course of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Female type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic hypertensive patients who visited Eulji General Hospital outpatient clinic from January 2004 to April 2004 were assigned to the diabetic cohort and the non-diabetic hypertensive cohort, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surveys on fracture event, use of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> medications, and bone mineral density were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of fractures was 88 in the female diabetic cohort (n=1,268, 60.6±11.5 years) and 57 in the female non-diabetic hypertensive cohort (n=1,014, 61.4±11.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RR in the diabetic cohort was 1.38 (P=0.064; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 1.94) when adjusted for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients with microvascular complications (61.0%) showed a higher RR of 1.81 (P=0.014; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.92) compared with those without these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> was comparable between the groups, while use of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> medication was more common in the diabetic cohort (12.8%) than in the hypertensive cohort (4.5%) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study, a higher fracture risk was observed in female type 2 diabetics with microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Special concern for this risk group is warranted </plain></SENT>
