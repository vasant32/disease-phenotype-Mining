<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants were 83 male and 3 female veterans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (M(age) = 62.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Self-report measures were completed during the baseline assessment of a larger intervention study conducted at the VA Boston Healthcare System </plain></SENT>
