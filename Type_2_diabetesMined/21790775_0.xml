<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined if forced vital capacity, forced 1 s expiratory volume and diffusion lung capacity correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> across different races in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the medical records of 19,882 adults 18-97 years of age in our centre from 1 January 2000 to 1 May 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After excluding patients with diseases causing abnormal lung function, 4164 subjects were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used multiple linear regressions to examine cross-sectional differences in forced vital capacity, forced 1 s expiratory volume and <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> diffusing capacity between patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, after adjustment for age, sex, race, height, smoking, BMI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 560) were older (62 ± 12 vs. 55 ± 16 years), more likely to be men (56 vs. 43%), overweight (BMI 31.7 ± 8.5 vs. 27.3 ± 6.7 kg/m2 ), have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (33 vs. 14%) and less likely to be Caucasians (65 vs. 76%) and never smokers (66 vs. 72%) compared with patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 3604) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean unadjusted values in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> vs. those without were: forced vital capacity 2.78 ± 0.91 vs. 3.19 ± 1.03 l; forced 1 s expiratory volume 2.17 ± 0.74 vs. 2.49 ± 0.0.83; and <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> diffusing capacity 16.67 ± 5.53 vs. 19.18 ± 6.72 ml(-1) min(-1) mmHg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences remained significant after adjustment for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After race stratification, only Caucasians with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a significant decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lung function measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have decreased lung function compared with those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Caucasians with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have more global lung function impairment compared with African-Americans and Hispanics </plain></SENT>
