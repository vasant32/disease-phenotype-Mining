<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circulating levels and/or activity of adiponectin were reported to influence susceptibility to several diseases, including type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, serum adiponectin levels and the association of adiponectin gene (ADIPQO) single-nucleotide polymorphism (G276T SNP) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients (n = 449) were recruited and divided into two groups, normotensive (n = 199) and hypertensive (n = 250) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrated that serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher in normotensive subjects compared with hypertensive subjects (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When these results were compared according to gender, only female hypertensive diabetic patients showed significantly higher levels of adiponectin (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, no significant difference in the genotypes and alleles frequencies of ADIPQO G276T SNP was observed between the two groups (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high circulating levels of adiponectin were found to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> only in type 2 diabetic female patients which might indicate a gender preference </plain></SENT>
