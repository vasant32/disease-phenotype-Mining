<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify additional T2D genes, we analyzed global gene expression in human islets from 63 donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 48 genes located near T2D risk variants, we identified gene coexpression and protein-protein interaction networks that were strongly associated with islet insulin secretion and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We integrated our data to form a rank list of putative T2D genes, of which CHL1, LRFN2, RASGRP1, and PPM1K were validated in INS-1 cells to influence insulin secretion, whereas GPR120 affected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression variation of the top 20 genes explained 24% of the variance in HbA(1c) with no claim of the direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data present a global map of genes associated with islet dysfunction and demonstrate the value of systems genetics for the identification of genes potentially involved in T2D </plain></SENT>
