<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A/B (CDKN2A/B) has been reported as a candidate gene of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) based on its chromosomal position and its important role in β-cell function and regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies to date have reported inconsistent findings regarding the association between T2D and CDKN2A/B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify this inconsistence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on alleles and genotypes prevalence of rs10811661 and rs564398 in CDKN2A/B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline databases were systematically reviewed for studies published between January, 2006, and November, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 reports were collected, among of them only 16 studies (including 24,407 cases and 33,937 controls) match the inclusion criteria and were selected for the statistical test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the meta-analysis of published data, our results suggest that the rs10811661 T allele (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.21-1.36, P &lt; 1 × 10(-5)) and TT genotype (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22-1.43, P &lt; 1 × 10(-5)) of CDKN2A/B were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> respectively, but rs564398 was not (for allele only: OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.05, P = 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between rs10811661 T allele and T2D was observed both in Asia (P &lt; 1 × 10(-4)) and Europe ethnicity groups (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis yielded evidence that rs10811661 of CDKN2A/B confers risk for T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger studies with mixed ethnicity subjects are required to validate our findings </plain></SENT>
