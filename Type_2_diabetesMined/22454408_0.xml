<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize research that tested culturally competent food-related interventions designed for African American women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, to review the current state of the literature and suggest recommendations for future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many African American women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are challenged to change their culturally rooted food habits to achieve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> educators and clinicians who work with African American women need knowledge of effective interventions to assist their clients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Online databases and research articles' reference lists were searched for relevant studies published from 1989 to 2010 that tested culturally competent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management interventions for African American women, that included at least 1 educational session on diet or nutrition, and that addressed a physiologic outcome, such as glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> or fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, 64% to 100% of the participants were African Americans, and 65% to 100% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six studies showed significant improvements in food practices, and 8 showed significant improvements in glycemic control as a result of the interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Few studies focused solely on helping African American women make culturally relevant dietary changes to control type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most interventions addressed food habits as one of many components for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control, perhaps overwhelming research participants with large amounts of varied information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Targeted interventions are recommended that focus on dietary changes as the foundation for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management education for African American women </plain></SENT>
