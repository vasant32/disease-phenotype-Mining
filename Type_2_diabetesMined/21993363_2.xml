<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a recently described member of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and this study investigated whether ACE2 polymorphisms are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, left ventricular (LV) mass, and cardiac function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Variants in ACE2 (rs1978124, rs2074192, rs4240157, rs4646156, rs4646188) were examined in 503 Caucasian subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As ACE2 is located on the X chromosome, analyses were performed separately for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was defined by a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications or blood pressure (BP) &gt;130/80 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV mass and systolic function (ejection fraction) were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In men, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was more prevalent with the ACE2 rs2074192 C allele (P = 0.023), rs4240157 G allele (P = 0.016) and rs4646188 T allele (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In men, the rs1978124 A allele was associated with a significantly lower ejection fraction compared to the G allele (62.3 ± 13.3 vs. 67.2 ± 10.9%, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association remained significant after covariate adjustment for age, body mass index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment, and BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In women, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was higher (P = 0.009) with the rs4240157 G allele, and the rs1978124 A allele was associated with significantly higher LV mass (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Caucasians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, genetic variation in ACE2 is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006673'>reduced systolic function</z:hpo> in men, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and increased LV mass in women </plain></SENT>
