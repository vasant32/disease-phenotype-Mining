<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients (n = 40) were randomly assigned to aerobic training or resistance training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after 4 months of intervention, metabolic phenotypes (including HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp-measured insulin sensitivity, and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test-assessed β-cell function), body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue by magnetic resonance imaging, cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscular strength were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After training, increase in peak oxygen consumption (V(O(2peak))) was greater in the aerobic group (time-by-group interaction P = 0.045), whereas increase in strength was greater in the resistance group (time-by-group interaction P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was similarly reduced in both groups (-0.40% [95% CI -0.61 to -0.18] vs. -0.35% [-0.59 to -0.10], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total and truncal fat, VAT, and SAT were also similarly reduced in both groups, whereas insulin sensitivity and lean limb mass were similarly increased. β-Cell function showed no significant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, improvement in HbA(1c) after training was independently predicted by baseline HbA(1c) and by changes in V(O(2peak)) and truncal fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training, similarly to aerobic training, improves metabolic features and insulin sensitivity and reduces abdominal fat in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes after training in V(O(2peak)) and truncal fat may be primary determinants of exercise-induced metabolic improvement </plain></SENT>
