<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 increases cardiovascular risk by favoring clot stability, interfering with vascular remodeling, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic persons whether an intensive lifestyle intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (ILI) would decrease PAI-1 levels independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and whether PAI-1 reduction would be associated with changes in fibrinogen, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactant, or fibrin fragment D-dimer (D-dimer), a marker of ambient coagulation balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 1-year changes in PAI-1, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>; fitness; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>; and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control with ILI in 1817 participants from Look AHEAD, a randomized trial investigating the effects of ILI, compared with usual care, on cardiovascular events in overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median PAI-1 levels decreased 29% with ILI and 2.5% with usual care (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements in fitness, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> were associated with decreased PAI-1, independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P = 0.03 for fitness, P &lt; 0.0001 for others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen and D-dimer remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in PAI-1 levels with ILI in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic individuals may reflect an improvement in adipose tissue health that could affect cardiovascular risk without changing fibrinogen or d-dimer levels </plain></SENT>
