<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: Background and objective:  There has been increasing recognition that obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> (OSA) is associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the association between the severity of OSA and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by performing a meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available prospective cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods:  A search was conducted of the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases through March 2012, to identify studies linking OSA with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only prospective cohort studies, in which the presence of OSA was confirmed by objective measurements, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fixed and random effects models were used to calculate pooled relative risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results:  This meta-analysis of six prospective cohort studies including a total of 5,953 participants, with follow-up periods of 2.7-16 years, and 332 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, showed that moderate-severe OSA was associated with a greater risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [relative risk (RR) 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.45], as compared with the absence of OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For subjects with mild OSA, as compared to those without OSA, the pooled RR of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.22 (95% CI 0.91-1.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  This meta-analysis indicates that moderate-severe OSA is associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and this appears to be an independent risk factor for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
