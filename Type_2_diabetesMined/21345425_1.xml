<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare ultrasound gradings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> with fat fraction (FF) on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS; the non-invasive reference standard for quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo>), and evaluate inter- and intraobserver variability in the ultrasound gradings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triple grading of hepatic ultrasound examination was performed by three independent graders on 131 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stored images of 60 of these individuals were assessed twice by each grader on separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients were pre-selected on the basis of ultrasound grading (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, indeterminate/mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>) to undergo (1)H-MRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the ultrasound gradings were determined with reference to MRS data, using two cut-offs of FF to define <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, ≥9% and ≥6.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median (intraquartile range) MRS FF (%) in the participants graded on ultrasound as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, indeterminate/mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> were 4.2 (1.2-5.7), 4.1 (3.1-8.5) and 19.4 (12.9-27.5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a liver FF of ≥6.1% on MRS to denote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo>, the unadjusted sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound gradings (severe versus other grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>) were 71 and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement within one grade was observed in 79% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exact intraobserver agreement ranged from 62 to 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hepatic ultrasound provided a good measure of the presence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> with good intra- and interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The grading of a mildly steatotic liver was less secure and, in particular, there was considerable overlap in hepatic FF with those who had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver on ultrasound </plain></SENT>
