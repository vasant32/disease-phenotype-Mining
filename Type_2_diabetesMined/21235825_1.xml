<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A randomized control trial was performed to test whether a lifestyle intervention program, carried out in a primary healthcare setting using existing resources, can reduce the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of 3 years' intervention are summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Through health checkups in communities and workplaces, 304 middle-aged IGT subjects with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 24.5 kg/m2 were recruited and randomized to the intervention group or control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lifestyle intervention was carried out for 3 years by public health nurses using the curriculum and educational materials provided by the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 year, the intervention had significantly improved body weight (-1.5 ± 0.7 vs. -0.7 ± 2.5 kg in the control; p = 0.023) and daily non-exercise leisure time energy expenditure (25 ± 113 vs. -3 ± 98 kcal; p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity assessed by the Matsuda index was improved by the intervention during the 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year cumulative incidence tended to be lower in the intervention group (14.8% vs.8.2%, log-rank test: p = 0.097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a sub-analysis for the subjects with a BMI &gt; 22.5 kg/m2, a significant reduction in the cumulative incidence was found (p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present lifestyle intervention program using existing healthcare resources is beneficial in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This has important implications for primary healthcare-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
