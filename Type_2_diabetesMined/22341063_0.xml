<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> (AP) and endodontic treatment in type 2 diabetic individuals as compared with nondiabetics from an adult Brazilian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Full-mouth radiographs from 30 type 2 diabetic and 60 age- and sex-matched nondiabetic individuals were examined, and the presence of AP lesions in untreated and root canal-treated teeth was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of teeth and the prevalence of root canal treatment were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AP was significantly more present in teeth from diabetic individuals (98/652, 15%) than in nondiabetic controls (162/1,368, 12%) (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A separate analysis of untreated and treated teeth revealed that significance was mostly because of the prevalence of AP in untreated teeth, which was 10% in diabetics and 7% in nondiabetics (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between diabetics and nondiabetics was observed for the other parameters under study, including the prevalence of AP in root canal-treated teeth, the number of teeth in the oral cavity, the number of treated teeth per individual, the number of individuals with at least 1 AP lesion or 1 root canal treatment, and the number of teeth with AP per individual (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AP was significantly more prevalent in untreated teeth from type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may serve as a disease modifier of AP in the sense that individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be more prone to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, findings do not confirm that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may influence the response to root canal treatment because treated teeth had no increased prevalence ofÂ AP when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
