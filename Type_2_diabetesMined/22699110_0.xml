<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is known to be an important risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its related comorbid conditions; however, its specific impact on generic health-related quality of life (HRQL) is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to estimate the association between body mass index (BMI) and HRQL in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire was administered in a follow-up of 10,385 participants aged 33-94 of the population-based German MONICA/KORA surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1033 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified by self-report combined with validated physician diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Semiparametric additive regression models were used to estimate the effect of BMI on EQ-5D health utilities adjusted for age, sex, education and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI was significantly associated with EQ-5D health utilities even after adjustment for macro- and microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional relationship between BMI and utilities was nonlinear, reflecting optimal health around 26kg/m(2) and significantly decreasing health utilities with increasing levels of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (-0.09 points between BMI values 26 and 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, the history of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (-0.13) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (-0.10) were the strongest predictors of reduced health utility scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMI is strongly associated with health utilities in persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that lifestyle measures to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> can markedly improve patients' health-related quality of life and that the negative effect of potential <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> should be taken into account when determining patient preferences for different type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment options </plain></SENT>
