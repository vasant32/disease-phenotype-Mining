<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the basis of poor glycemic control and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle counseling and pharmacologic hypoglycemic therapy were intensified to improve glycemic control, but <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapy was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 4 Â± 2 months, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> had decreased by a mean of 2.1%, but the only effect on the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were statistically significant decreases in nonesterified fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size increased and the proportion of electronegative <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In parallel, total Lp-PLA2 activity decreased significantly, promoting a redistribution of Lp-PLA2 activity toward a higher proportion in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improvements in glycemic control led to more marked changes in Lp-PLA2 activity and distribution in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had not received previous <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, optimizing glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> promotes atheroprotective changes, including larger <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size, decreased electronegative <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and a higher proportion of Lp-PLA2 activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
