<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate whether work-related psychosocial stress (defined by a work-related stress model or by long work hours) is associated with the risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted until March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies eligible for inclusion were published observational epidemiological studies of adult participants in community or occupational settings if they had a measure of work-related stress on a validated scale or a measure of work hours or overtime assessed prior to, or at the same time as, assessment of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Where possible, meta-analysis was conducted to obtain summary odds ratios of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We located nine studies (four prospective, one case-control and four cross-sectional) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The meta-analyses did not show any statistically significant associations between any individual aspect of work-related psychosocial stress or job strain and risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The specific hypothesis that a working environment characterized by high psychosocial stress is directly associated with increased risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could not be supported from the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
