<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) enzymes play a major role in detoxification of reactive oxygen species and protection against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations of SOD1 gene variants with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were reported in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations of allelic variations in SOD1 gene with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven SNPs in SOD1 region were analyzed in 3744 type 2 European Caucasian diabetic patients from the DIABHYCAR (a 6-year prospective study) and DIABHYCAR_GENE cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios or hazard ratios for prevalence and incidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and cardiovascular events were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed an association of rs1041740 with the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> at baseline (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10-2.10, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association with the incidence of renal events (doubling of the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels or the requirement of hemodialysis or renal transplantation) or cardiovascular events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was observed during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, three variants were associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from cardiovascular causes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) during the follow-up: rs9974610 (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.88, p=0.005), rs10432782 (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.16-2.48, p=0.007) and rs1041740 (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.78, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with a major role for SOD1 in the mechanisms of cardiovascular protection against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
