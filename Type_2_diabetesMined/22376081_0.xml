<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aims of this study are to investigate not only the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effectiveness of twice-daily premixed insulin lispro 25 (Humalog(®) Mix25(™), Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN), but also the optimal divided ratio of total Mix25 dose in Korean patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we retrieved data for subjects who were on intensive insulin therapy with twice-daily Mix25 regimen for at least 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA(1c)) and other clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups were defined according to dose ratio of pre-breakfast to pre-dinner insulin at 24 weeks: Group I, pre-breakfast:pre-dinner insulin dose ratio=50:50; Group II, ratio=53:47-75:25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 143 subjects were ultimately analyzed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twice-daily Mix25 significantly improved HbA(1c) levels from 10.1% to 7.7%, and 34% of patients had reached the target glycemic goal (HbA(1c)&lt;7%) after 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with Group I, a significant reduction in HbA(1c) (Group I vs. Group II, -1.9±0.3% vs. -2.8±0.3%, P=0.02) and a larger proportion of subjects with HbA(1c)&lt;7% (23.2% vs. 46.7%, P=0.01) were observed in subjects in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among clinical and laboratory factors, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odd ratios [OR]=0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.99, P=0.04) and history of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> use (OR=0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.72, P=0.01) were independently associated with achieving target HbA(1c) levels less than 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twice-daily Mix25 is an effective option for Korean subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> having uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A higher pre-breakfast/pre-dinner dose ratio (53:47-75:25) might be taken into consideration as an initial protocol to accomplish better glycemic control in twice-daily Mix25 </plain></SENT>
