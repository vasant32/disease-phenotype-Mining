<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we sought to test whether these effects were apparent in high-risk individuals and modify treatment responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the potential role of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant in predicting resistance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> or a lack of improvement of proinsulin processing during 2.5-years of follow-up participants (N = 2,994) from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP), a randomized controlled trial designed to prevent or delay <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed no difference in the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> by rs7903146 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the T allele (conferring higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) at rs7903146 was associated with higher fasting proinsulin at baseline (P&lt;0.001), higher baseline proinsulin:insulin ratio (p&lt;0.0001) and increased proinsulin:insulin ratio over a median of 2.5 years of follow-up (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects were comparable across treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a lack of impact of the TCF7L2 genotypes on the ability to lose weight, but the presence of a consistent effect on the proinsulin:insulin ratio over the course of DPP, suggests that high-risk genotype carriers at this locus can successfully lose weight to counter <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk despite persistent deficits in insulin production </plain></SENT>
