<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the monocyte proteome for potential markers that would enhance the ability to screen for early inflammatory status in Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), using proteomic technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monocytic cells (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1) were primed with high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (HG), their protein profiles were analyzed using 2DE and the downregulated differentially expressed spots were identified using MALDI TOF/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected five proteins that were secretory in function with the help of bioinformatic programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A predominantly downregulated protein identified as cyclophilin A (sequence coverage 98%) was further validated by immunoblotting experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cellular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of cyclophilin A in various HG-primed cells were studied using qRT-PCR assays and it was observed to decrease in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LC-ESI-MS was used to identify this protein in the conditioned media of HG-primed cells and confirmed by Western blotting as well as ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cyclophilin A was also detected in the plasma of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cyclophilin A is secreted by monocytes in response to HG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the paracrine and autocrine actions of cyclophilin A, the secreted immunophilin could be significant for progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study also provides evidence that analysis of monocyte secretome is a viable strategy for identifying candidate plasma markers in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
