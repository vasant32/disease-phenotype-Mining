<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 353 people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in the AT.LANTUS Follow-on study, completing measures of well-being (W-BQ28), treatment satisfaction (DTSQ) and self-care (SCI-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory factor analyses was used to confirm the W-BQ28 structure and internal consistency reliability was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional statistical tests were conducted to explore convergent, divergent and known-groups validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minimal important differences were calculated using distribution and anchor-based techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Structure of the W-BQ28 (seven four-item subscales plus 16-item generic and 12-item <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific scales) was confirmed (comparative fit index = 0.917, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Internal consistency reliability was satisfactory (four-item subscales: alpha = 0.73-0.90; 12/16-item scales: Î± = 0.84-0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Convergent validity was supported by expected moderate to high correlations (r(s) = 0.35-0.67) between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> W-BQ28 subscales (except Energy); divergent validity was supported by expected low to moderate correlations with treatment satisfaction (r(s) = -0.03-0.52) and self-care (r(s) = 0.02-0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Known-groups validity was supported with statistically significant differences by sex, age and HbA(1c) for expected subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Minimal important differences were established (range 0.14-2.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The W-BQ28 is a valid and reliable measure of generic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific well-being in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of the utility of W-BQ28 (including establishment of minimal important differences) means that its use is indicated in research and clinical practice </plain></SENT>
