<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was HbA(1c) change from baseline to week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and safety end points were assessed after 1 year.RESULTSAt week 12, adjusted mean HbA(1c) decreased by -0.76% with linagliptin and -0.15% with placebo (treatment difference, -0.60%; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.31; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) improvements were sustained with linagliptin (-0.71%) over placebo (0.01%) at 1 year (treatment difference -0.72%, -1.03 to -0.41; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean insulin doses decreased by -6.2 units with linagliptin and -0.3 units with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall adverse event incidence was similar over 1 year (94.1 vs. 92.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> with linagliptin and placebo was comparably low (three patients per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin and placebo had little effect on renal function (median change in eGFR, -0.8 vs. -2.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), and no drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> occurred.CONCLUSIONSIn patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and severe RI, linagliptin provided clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control with very low risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, stable body weight, and no cases of drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential for linagliptin to spare insulin and provide long-term renal safety warrants further investigations </plain></SENT>
