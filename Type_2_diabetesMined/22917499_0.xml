<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We want to examine whether increased intake of soft drink and juices have contributed to this jump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were 27,585 Japanese men and women aged 40-59 years who had no prior history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intakes of soft drink, 100% fruit juice and vegetable juice were measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 5 and 10 years were estimated by using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 484 men and 340 women reported newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High soft drink intake was associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women but not men; odds ratio (95% CI) for women with almost daily consumption versus non-consumers was 2.10 (1.23-3.59; P-trend = 0.004) and 1.79 (1.11-2.89; P-trend = 0.01) at 5 and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association was evident in overweight, highly educated and premenopausal women, and women with blue collar job </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intakes of 100% fruit juice and vegetable juice were not associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for either gender (P-trend &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Soft drink but not pure juices consumption was associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese women </plain></SENT>
