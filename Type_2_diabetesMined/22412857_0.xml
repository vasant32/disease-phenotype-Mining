<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> In Various Ethnic groups in UK (DRIVE UK) Study is a cross-sectional study on the ethnic variations of the prevalence of DR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> in two multi-racial cohorts in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>People on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> register in West Yorkshire and South East London who were screened, treated or monitored between April 2008 to July 2009 (London) or August 2009 (West Yorkshire) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data included age, sex, ethnic group, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, presenting visual acuity and the results of grading of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence estimates for the ethnic groups were age-standardised to the white European population for comparison purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 57,144 people on the two diabetic registers, data were available on 50,285 individuals (88.0%), of these 3,323 had type 1 and 46,962 had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the prevalence of any DR was 38.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 37.4% to 38.5%) in white Europeans compared to 52.4% (51.2% to 53.6%) in African/Afro-Caribbeans and 42.3% (40.3% to 44.2%) in South Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, sight threatening DR was also significantly more prevalent in Afro-Caribbeans (11.5%, 95% CI 10.7% to 12.3%) and South Asians (10.3%, 9.0% to 11.5%) compared to white Europeans (5.5%, 5.3% to 5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences observed in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance, but there were lower numbers for these analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minority ethnic communities with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the UK are more prone to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, including sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> compared to white Europeans </plain></SENT>
