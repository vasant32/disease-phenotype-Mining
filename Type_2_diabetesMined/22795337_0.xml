<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increased evidence suggests that apart from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>increased albumin excretion</z:mp> and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR); there are also patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0005528'>decreased GFR</z:mp> but without <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms regarding these clinical conditions are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest that different blood pressure (BP) levels may be one the factors for these different clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, before labeling BP as a causative factor; one must show whether BP levels are different in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the current study was performed to analyze the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and circadian blood pressure levels in newly diagnosed essential hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical history, physical examination, laboratory analysis and ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPMs) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>24-h urine specimens were collected to measure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and albumin excretion RESULTS: In total 216 patients were included which were divided into 4 groups: group 1 composed of 90 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GFR and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (MA), group 2 composed of 50 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GFR and with MA, group 3 composed of 36 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005528'>decreased GFR</z:mp> and without MA and group 4 composed of 40 patients with both <z:mp ids='MP_0005528'>decreased GFR</z:mp> and MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of dippers vs. non dippers was not different between group 1, group 2 and group 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However ratio of dippers was higher in group 1 when compared to group 4 (P: 0.003) and group 4 patients have an odds of 7.678 (CI: 1.657-35.576, P: 0.009) for non-dapping status when compared to patients in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, ABPM measurements were highest in patients with both <z:mp ids='MP_0005528'>decreased GFR</z:mp> and MA, whereas they are lowest in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GFR and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> UAE </plain></SENT>
