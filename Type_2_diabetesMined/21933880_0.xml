<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We mailed letters containing an invitation to complete an online questionnaire to 2045 individuals, followed by two reminders; the second included a paper version of the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1081 people responded to either version of the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to total respondents, respondents completing the online version were more likely to be male, better educated, and younger, and have had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for a shorter period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-respondents, respondents were more likely to be male and have a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Web-based surveys are capable of delivering a substantial number of responses cost-effectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, disadvantages related to selection bias should be taken into account, and mixed-mode methods should be considered when surveying populations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
