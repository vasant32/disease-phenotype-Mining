<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects and Methods: In total, eight subjects (seven men, one woman) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent dose optimization meal challenge (MC) visits (100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) and MCs with varied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> meal contents (50%, 200%, and 0% calculated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHOs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was change in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) excursions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline demographics were 60±7 years of age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 12.3±4.27 years, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1C) of 7.82±1.04%, and body mass index of 31.3±5.48 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Maximum mean <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> excursions for the nominal 100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> meals were -13±15 mg/dL for breakfast (B) and -14±15 mg/dL for lunch (L), similar to those after 50% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> meals (B, -17±16 mg/dL; L, +14±10 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest excursions occurred during 200% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> meals and remained below American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association targets (B, +19±16 mg/dL; L, +32±29 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 15 of the MCs, subjects took their usual TI dose and then had no meal (0% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the 0% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> MCs, the largest mean <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> excursion were -33±9 mg/dL at 60 min (B) and -31±10 mg/dL at 60 and 90 min (L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean A1C dropped from 7.82±1.04% at the Week 1 visit to 6.18±0.46% (P=0.00091) at the Week 19 visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Results in eight patients suggest that once an optimal dose of TI is determined, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients can ingest meals with a wide range of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> content or even skip meals without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During this pilot study TI therapy improved A1C by -1.63% (P=0.00091) during 19 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
