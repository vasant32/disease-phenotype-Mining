<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of exenatide on 24-hour urinary albumin, urinary transforming growth factor-β(1) (TGF-β(1)) and type IV collagen excretion in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: 31 type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> were randomly allocated to receive exenatide (group Exe, n = 13) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment (group Glm, n = 18) for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2-hour postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 24-hour urinary albumin, urinary TGF-β(1) and type IV collagen concentration were analyzed between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>20 age- and BMI-matched healthy subjects were chosen as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (group NC, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: After 16 weeks of treatment, 24-hour urinary albumin, urinary TGF-β(1) and type IV collagen in group Exe were significantly lower than those of group Glm (p &lt; 0.01), while glycemic control had no statistical difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Our results indicate that exenatide reduces urinary TGF-β(1) and type IV collagen excretion in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, which may be partly contributory to its directly renoprotective role </plain></SENT>
