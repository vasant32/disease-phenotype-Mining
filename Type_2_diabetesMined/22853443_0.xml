<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the preferences of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for liraglutide vs other <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering drugs, based on outcomes of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Willingness to pay (WTP) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drug treatment was assessed by combining results from a recent WTP study with analysis of results from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (LEAD) programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LEAD programme included six randomised clinical trials with 3967 participants analysing efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.2 mg (LEAD 1-6 trials), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (LEAD 1 trial), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (LEAD 2-3 trials), insulin glargine (LEAD 5 trial), and exenatide (LEAD 6 trial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The WTP survey used discrete choice experimental (DCE) methodology to evaluate the convenience and clinical effects of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: People with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were prepared to pay an extra €2.64/day for liraglutide compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, an extra €1.94/day compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, an extra €3.36/day compared with insulin glargine, and an extra €0.81/day compared with exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> was the largest component of WTP for liraglutide compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, and insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in the administration of the two drugs was the largest component of WTP for liraglutide (once daily anytime) compared with exenatide (twice daily with meals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A limitation of the study was that it was based on six clinical trials where liraglutide was the test drug, but each trial had a different comparator, therefore the clinical effects of liraglutide were much better documented than the comparators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: WTP analyses of the clinical results from the LEAD programme suggested that participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were willing to pay appreciably more for liraglutide than other <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was driven by the relative advantage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, and insulin glargine, and administration frequency compared with exenatide </plain></SENT>
