<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we found that CAS associated with DR was independent of the traditional risk factors for CAD [odds ratio (OR): 5.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-10.1; p &lt; 0.001], and the severity and extent of CAS were significantly increased with the incidence and progression of DR (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship of CAS with DR was relatively continuous and graded under the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, much of CAS and DR could be still multifactorial with common pathway </plain></SENT>
