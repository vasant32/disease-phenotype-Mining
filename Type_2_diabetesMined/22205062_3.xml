<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As it relates to specific treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, clinicians have traditionally initiated lifestyle intervention and progressed therapy using various drug treatments first as monotherapy and then as combination therapy throughout the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This "stepwise" strategy has not always achieved the desired outcome of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycemic control; consequently, several clinical problems, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, new therapies that improve glycemic control and have favorable effects to address the unmet clinical problems have recently been developed or are still in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These therapies include 2 classes of incretin-directed therapy, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 agonists, which help restore physiologic levels and activity of the incretin glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also in development are additional therapies that have effects on the kidney to promote <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These therapies are proposed to treat the key <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> associated with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and minimize the side effects noted with conventional therapies </plain></SENT>
