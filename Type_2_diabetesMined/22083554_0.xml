<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on disease-free survival (DFS) following mastectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases included in this retrospective study were selected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> women who had undergone mastectomy and completed adjuvant chemotherapy from 1998 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into two groups: diabetic and non-diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' age, sex, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), histopathological features, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, lymph node involvement, hormone receptor and HER2-neu status, and treatment types were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 483 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postmenopausal patients' rate (53.7% vs. 36.8%, P = 0.016) and mean BMI levels were statistically higher (32.2 vs. 27.9, P = 0.007) in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference for histological subgroup, grade, ER and PR positivity, HER2-neu overexpression rate, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size between the diabetic and non-diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymph node involvements were statistically higher in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic patients (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median disease-free survival is 81 months (95% CI, 61.6-100.4) in non-diabetic patients and 36 months (95% CI, 13.6-58.4) in diabetic patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of recurrence was significantly increased in those with HER2-neu overexpression and lymph node involvement and decreased with PR-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an independent prognostic factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
