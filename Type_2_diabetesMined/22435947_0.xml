<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the explanatory factors for disability in Japanese diabetic elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 6-year decline in physical disability and functional limitations was investigated among 317 elderly people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recruited in a large-scale prospective study of the Japanese Elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, blood examinations and complications was obtained, and basic activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) were assessed by total score of the Barthel index and the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 6 years of follow up, 13.6% of patients had developed a new ADL disability and 38.3% had developed a new functional impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 65-74 years age group, basic ADL decreased only in males, whereas females became functionally impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 75-84 years age group, basic and IADL decreased in both males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were prognostic for impairment of basic ADL, whereas baseline IADL problems, lower cognitive function, physical inactivity and insulin therapy were significant predictors of a future decline in the IADL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study identified several factors predicting the future decline of basic ADL and IADL in diabetic elderly patients, and provided a conceptual framework that might help to clarify the pathways leading to disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the specific causes of each functional problem are modifiable, comprehensive treatment and care are needed to allow Japanese diabetic elderly patients to have more favorable living conditions </plain></SENT>
