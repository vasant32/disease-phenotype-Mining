<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> experience high levels of distress stemming from concerns and worries associated with their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related distress has predominantly been studied in relation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management and metabolic control, and to some extent in relation to coping styles and perceived social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, little is known about the relative contribution of clinical indicators, coping styles and perceptions of social support to perceived distress among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample comprising 425 Norwegian adults, aged 30-70, with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, completed questionnaires assessing coping styles, perceived social support from health professionals and family and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress assessed by the Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographical and clinical data were collected by self-report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected in October 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings:  Results from the regression analyses showed a greater variance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> accounted for by coping styles (21·3%) and perceived support (19·7%) than by clinical indicators (5·8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Findings may indicate that healthcare providers should pay more attention to non-clinical factors such as coping styles and social support, when addressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They should also be aware that interventions based on psychosocial approaches may primarily influence distress, and not necessarily metabolic control </plain></SENT>
