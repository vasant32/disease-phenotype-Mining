<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different findings show that the frequency of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has risen rapidly in Morocco </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and its associated risk factors among a group of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to examine the level of control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> among type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 525 type 2 diabetics in three Moroccan regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The structured questionnaire was used to gather information on sociodemographic variables, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, use of anti-hypertensive medications and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements including weight and height were measured by trained staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was measured using standardized sphygmomanometers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was 70.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was positively associated with age (p&lt;10-4), BMI (p&lt;0.0002) and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p) CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is a common co-morbidity among Moroccan diabetic patients with high rate of ignorance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> among study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The focus must be on patients and family education, counseling and behavioral interventions designed to modify lifestyle such as increasing physical activity and adopting recommended dietary changes, as well as compliance with medications </plain></SENT>
