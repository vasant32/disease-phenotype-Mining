<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: We previously reported that a weight-maintenance diet with a carbohydrate:protein:fat ratio of 30:30:40%, ingested for 5 weeks, improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in subjects with untreated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we also determined that insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we provide further information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, 24-hour total and individual amino acids, glucagon and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> data are provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined whether these multiple effectors resulted in a positive nitrogen balance and an increase in fat-free mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin and IGF-I should stimulate protein accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in amino acids, particularly branched chain amino acids, should facilitate this, whereas glucagon and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> could have adverse effects in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight men with untreated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A randomized crossover design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained before and after 5 weeks on a control diet (55% carbohydrate:15% protein:30% fat) and on a 30% carbohydrate:30% protein:40% fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nitrogen balance and body composition were determined at the beginning and end of each dietary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, the mean 24-hour total amino acid area response was higher after ingesting the 30:30:40 diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the increase was only statistically significant for the branched chain amino acids, and phenylalanine and tyrosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> profile was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Glucagon was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nitrogen balance was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Body weight was stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Body composition and computed tomography data indicate no change in the fat-free mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This high protein, low carbohydrate diet induced a metabolic milieu which strongly favors a positive protein balance, and a positive balance was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, an increase in lean (protein) mass was not documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Whether such a diet in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is useful in preventing or delaying the loss of total lean body mass and/or sarcopenia associated with aging remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
