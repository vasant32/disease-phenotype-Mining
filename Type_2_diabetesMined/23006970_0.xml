<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the association between ethnicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> and to analyze if this association remains after adjusting for explanatory variables including age, marital status, HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study was conducted at four primary health care centers in the Swedish town of Sodertalje </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 354 persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (173 Assyrians/Syrians and 181 Swedish-born patients) participated in the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was the self-reported presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> based on two questions, one regarding loss of ability to have sexual intercourse and the other loss of sexual desire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response rates were 78% and 86%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The total prevalence of loss of ability to have intercourse was 29.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate models, the odds of loss of ability to have intercourse was significantly higher in the oldest age group (OR = 5.80; 95% CI, 2.33--14.40), in men (OR = 3.33; 95% CI, 1.33--8.30), and in unmarried individuals (OR = 2.40; 95% CI, 1.02--5.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds of reporting loss of sexual desire was higher in Assyrians/Syrians than in Swedish-born patients and increased from 2.00 in the age- and gender-adjusted model to 2.70 in the fully adjusted model when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confounders were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Sexual dysfunction</z:e> appears to be more common in Assyrians/Syrians than in Swedish-born patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Health care workers should actively ask about sexual function in their patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
