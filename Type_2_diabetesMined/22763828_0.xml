<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The indirect immunoperoxidase technique was performed on anterior capsules obtained from 25 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM group) and 25 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical difference in the expression of PCNA, ICAM-1, and vimentin in LECs between the 2 groups was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PCNA expression was decreased (P=0.036) but ICAM-1 expression was significantly increased (P&lt;0.0001) in the DM group as compared with that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference was noted in the expression of vimentin between the 2 groups (P=0.264) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased proliferation of LECs and increased expression of ICAM-1 in LECs might play an important role in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
