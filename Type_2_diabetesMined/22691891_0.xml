<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore the aim of the study is to compare the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk in diabetic and non diabetic participants and to evaluate whether there is an association betweeen NAFLD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty five type 2 diabetic (study group) and 44 nondiabetic patients (control group) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to degree of hepatosteatosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 include grade≥2 hepatosteatosis and group 2 include grade&lt;2 hepatosteatosis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As a result, hepatosteatosis rates were found to be similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients (P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean CIMT was significantly higher in diabetic patients (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and glucolise <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) were found to be higher in grade≥2 hepatosteatosis group (P=0.002 and 0.004 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But CIMT was found to be similar between hepatosteatosis groups (P=0.618) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NAFLD is extremely common in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is mainly associated with uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CIMT values as cardiovascular risk assessment were found to be significantly higher in diabetic patients regardless degree of hepatosteatosis </plain></SENT>
