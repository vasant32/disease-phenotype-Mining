<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>29, e365-e368 (2012) ABSTRACT: Aim  <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is defined by reduced bioavailability of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The global arginine bioavailability ratio and the arginine to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> ratio have recently been shown to be associated with cardiovascular outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of a multifactorial risk factor intervention in subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on these two potential new cardiovascular surrogate parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods  In a single-centre and prospective study, we investigated 41 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not reaching treatment targets according to current local <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> guidelines in two out of three of the following measurements: HbA(1c) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> 2.6 or blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 3 months, therapy was intensified according to current guidelines aiming to reach the treatment targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline and 3 months, arginine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> were chromatographically determined after pre-column-derivatization followed by fluorescent detection, and arginine bioavailability ratios were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results  Intensified risk factor management significantly improved the global arginine bioavailability ratio (0.33 ± 0.12 at baseline vs. 0.38 ± 0.14 after 3 months; P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement was only seen in patients with short <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (&lt; 5 years), whereas in patients with longer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration improvement did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion  In patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, intensified risk factor management improves arginine bioavailability ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seems to be an important factor influencing the capacity of the global arginine bioavailability ratio improvement </plain></SENT>
