<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to document factors reported by overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as enhancing or impeding sustainability of lifestyle behaviours following participation in such a programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients who completed a 16-week research-based supervised lifestyle intervention programme, incorporating a structured energy restricted diet with or without supervised resistance-exercise training underwent a semi-structured qualitative interview about their experiences in maintaining programme components after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants maintained 8.8 ± 8.9 kg of the 13.9 ± 6.6 kg <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> achieved with the research-based supervised lifestyle intervention programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 23% of participants indicated continuation of the complete diet programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Desire for 'variety' (33%) and increased portion size (27%) were the most commonly reported reasons for discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants who undertook supervised exercise training during the programme indicated access to appropriate programmes/facilities (38%), more affordable gym membership (21%) and having a personal trainer/motivator (17%) would have facilitated exercise continuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, success of the research-based supervised lifestyle intervention programme was perceived as being primarily due to high levels of professional support and supervision, the discontinuation of which subsequently presented difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interview data provide insight into what people experience following the completion of a research-based intensive lifestyle intervention programme and suggest that programmes assembled for research purposes with the emphasis on compliance may not necessarily promote sustainable change </plain></SENT>
