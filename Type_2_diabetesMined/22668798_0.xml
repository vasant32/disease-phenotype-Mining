<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 38 elderly Type 2 diabetic patients with CRD (Stage 3 - 4) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks on a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> protein diet regimen (NPD) providing 1.0 g/kg per day, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were assigned for 30 months, randomly, to a LPD (0.7 g/kg per day), either 7 days a week (LPD 7/7) or 6 days a week (LPD 6/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mini mental state examination (MMSE), activities daily living (ADL), cumulative illness severity (CIRS-IS), geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale (GDS-15) and short-form healthy survey (SF- 36) were evaluated every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before the LPD regimen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (CrCl), MMSE, ADL, CIRS-IS, GDS-15 and SF-36 were similar in both LPD 7/7 and LPD 6/7 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 30 months, the mean GDS- 15 increased significantly more in LPD 7/7 group than in LPD 6/7 group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both mean SF-36 MCS and SF-36 PCS were decreased significantly more in LPD 7/7 group than in LPD 6/7 group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 30 months, the decline in CrCl observed was similar in LPD 7/7 and LPD 6/7 groups (2.77 ± 0.3 and 2.84 ± 0.3 ml/min/year, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In elderly Type 2 diabetic patients, long term effects of LPD 6/7 regimen in comparison to LPD 7/7 are associated with a similar decline in CrCl, but with decreased depressive symptoms and a better quality of life </plain></SENT>
