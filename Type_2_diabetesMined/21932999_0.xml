<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL), a 60-cm, impermeable fluoropolymer liner anchored in the duodenum to create a duodenal-jejunal bypass, on metabolic parameters in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two subjects (mean age, 46.2±10.5 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a body mass index between 40 and 60 kg/m(2) (mean body mass index, 44.8±7.4 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in this 52-week, prospective, open-label clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic device implantation was performed with the patient under general anesthesia, and the subjects were examined periodically during the next 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end points included changes in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels and changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DJBL was removed endoscopically at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen subjects completed the 52-week study, and the mean duration of the implant period for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects was 41.9±3.2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reasons for early removal of the device included device migration (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> (n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (n=2), principal investigator request (n=2), and discovery of an unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using last observation carried forward, statistically significant reductions in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-30.3±10.2 mg/dL), fasting insulin (-7.3±2.6 μU/mL), and HbA1c (-2.1±0.3%) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study, 16 of the 22 subjects had an HbA1c&lt;7% compared with only one of 22 at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (n=11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> (n=5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (n=7), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (n=7) were the most common device-related adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DJBL improves glycemic status in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and therefore represents a nonsurgical, reversible alternative to bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
