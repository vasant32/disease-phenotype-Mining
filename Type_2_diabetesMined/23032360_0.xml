<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, available evidence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> is conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the association between Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies published regarding this subject.Methods:PubMed database and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for epidemiological studies (published between 1970 and 2011), investigating the relationship between Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pooled risk ratio (RR) was calculated using random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroup, sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were also done.Results:Forty-five studies (29 cohort and 16 case-control studies) involving 8.1 million participants and 132â€‰331 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> cases detected a significant inverse association between Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For cohort studies alone, the RR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.80-0.94), and for case-control studies alone, the RR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.74-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis done by excluding one outlier further strengthened our negative association (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No evidence of publication bias was observed.Conclusions:This meta-analysis provides strongest evidence supporting that Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is significantly inversely associated with risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>.<z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>Prostate Cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033575" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Prostatic Disease</z:e> advance online publication, 2 October 2012; doi:10.1038/pcan.2012.40 </plain></SENT>
