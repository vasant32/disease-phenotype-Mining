<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective randomized cross-over placebo-controlled study of 36 adults age 40-75 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recruited from a single academic health center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intervention was for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week wash-out period, followed by a second 12-week cross-over treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was comparison of the change in ADMA levels in the two treatment periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included change in NOx and F2-isoprostanes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled in the study, 31 completed the protocol; the study enrollment met the sample size required to detect a change of 18% in levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in ADMA, NOx and F2-isoprostanes levels in the two treatment periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-study medication changes or changes in dose were infrequent, and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> was added during the study period in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite previous animal data that showed an effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on ADMA, the current study in human patients did not demonstrate any differences in ADMA, NOx, or F2-isoprostane levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results do not favor that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> has a significant impact on ADMA levels in human patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
