<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> is a pivotal process in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which can be noninvasively imaged by FDG <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (FDG-PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid artery wall FDG uptake was quantified in 134 patients (age 60.2 ± 9.7 years; diabetic subjects, n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pre-scan <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (gluc) level corrected mean of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) values ((mean)SUV(gluc)), mean of the maximum target-to-background ratio ((mean)TBR(gluc)), and single hottest segment (SHS(gluc)) of FDG uptake in the artery wall were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between FDG uptake, the presence of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were then assessed by multiple regression analysis with backward elimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study demonstrated a significant association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and FDG uptake in the arterial wall (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean)SUV(gluc) β = 0.324, (mean)TBR(gluc) β = 0.317, and SHS(gluc) β = 0.298; for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in diabetic patients, both body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ((mean)SUV(gluc) β = 0.4, (mean)TBR(gluc) β = 0.357, and SHS(gluc) β = 0.388; for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.015) and smoking ((mean)TBR(gluc), β = 0.312; SHS(gluc), β = 0.324; for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.04) were significantly associated with FDG uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly associated with carotid wall FDG uptake in patients with known or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and smoking add to the risk of increased FDG uptake values </plain></SENT>
