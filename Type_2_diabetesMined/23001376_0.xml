<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the yield from the LPRS when applied in two <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Let's Prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (LPD) and Walking Away from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (WAD) studies used the LPRS to identify people at risk of IGR or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 54 general practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The top 10% at risk within each practice were invited for screening using a 75 g OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate to the invitation and the prevalence of IGR and/or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in each study were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of those invited 19.2% (n = 3,449) in LPD and 22.1% (n = 833) in WAD attended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those screened for LPD 25.5% (95% CI 24.1, 27.0) had IGR and 4.5% (95% CI 3.8, 5.2) had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, giving a prevalence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> of 30.1% (95% CI 28.5, 31.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparable rates were seen for the WAD study: IGR 26.5% (95% CI 23.5, 29.5), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 3.0% (95% CI 1.8, 4.2) and IGR/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 29.5% (95% CI 26.4, 32.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Using the LPRS identifies a high yield of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, significantly higher than those seen in a population screening programme in the same locality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The LPRS is an inexpensive and simple way of targeting screening programmes at those with the highest risk </plain></SENT>
