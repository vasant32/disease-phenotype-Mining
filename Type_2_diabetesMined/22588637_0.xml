<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of birth size on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin metabolism among old non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also explored the combined effect of birth size and midlife body mass index (BMI) on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study comprised 1,682 Icelanders whose birth records included anthropometrical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same individuals had participated in the prospective population-based Reykjavik Study, where BMI was assessed at a mean age of 47 years, and in the AGES-Reykjavik Study during 2002 to 2006, where fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and HbA(1c) were measured and homeostasis model assessment for the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) calculated at a mean age of 75.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined as having a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, using <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-modifying medication or fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of &gt;7.0 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the participants, 249 had prevalent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower birth weight and body length were associated with higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, HOMA-IR and HbA(1c) among old non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher birth weight and ponderal index at birth decreased the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in old age, odds ratio (OR), 0.61 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.48-0.79] and 0.96 (95 % CI, 0.92-1.00), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with those with high birth weight and low BMI in midlife, the odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was almost five-fold for individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> and high BMI (OR, 4.93; 95 % CI, 2.14-11.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in adulthood might be particularly detrimental to the health of old individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
