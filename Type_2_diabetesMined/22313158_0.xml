<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Some guidelines or studies consider haematuria an indication for renal biopsy or a potential cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> that precludes accurate assessment of urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the justification of excluding haematuria in interpreting urinary albumin excretion in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its associations with other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May and November 2008, patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a single centre with data on urinary albumin excretion and urinalysis in the same urine sample were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin excretion was determined by urine albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio in spot urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of haematuria was made by positive urine occult blood from 1+ to 4+ and/or presence of more than nine red blood cells/ml in urinalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic, anthropometric, clinical and laboratory variables and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated complications were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 743 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of haematuria among patients with normoalbuminuria, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, or macroalbuminuria was 8.7% (n = 13), 16.1% (n = 67) and 35.8% (n = 64), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urine albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio was significantly higher, while macroalbuminuria was more common in patients with haematuria (n = 144) than in those without (n = 599) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis identified urine albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (odds ratio 1.33, P = 0.01) and macroalbuminuria (odds ratio 2.66, P = 0.01) as the only independent predictors of haematuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, urine albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio was an independent predictor of haematuria in the macroalbuminuria subgroup (odds ratio 1.30, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased urine albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio and macroalbuminuria were the only independent predictors of haematuria in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, raising questions on the justifications of excluding haematuria in interpreting urinary albumin excretion in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and including haematuria as an indication for renal biopsy in those with macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
