<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We tested for associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein 4 (RBP4) haplotypes found on human chromosome 10q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This locus had been linked to eGFR in a previous linkage scan in patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed 469 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 174 normoalbuminuric controls for associations between RBP4 haplotypes and eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison with controls, 295 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> were tested for associations with advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed using high-resolution DNA melting assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was performed using the haplo.stats package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genetic variations in RBP4 were not associated with advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the common A/G/G/C haplotype, C/A/A/C carriers among the normoalbuminuric controls had higher eGFR values among younger patients but lower eGFRs among the older patients (effect size=2.2, P=3.3×10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, while eGFR values were fairly consistent over the range of systolic blood pressure (SBP) values for the common haplotype, eGFR in C/A/A/C carriers increased with SBP (effect size=3.6, P=1.5×10(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant interaction between the C/A/A/C haplotype and HbA1c as they affect eGFR compared to the common haplotype (effect size=2.1, P=2.1×10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Power calculations demonstrated that our study had &gt;90% power to detect the observed interactions even while performing multiple hypotheses testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The interaction between SBP and the C/A/A/C haplotype remained significant (P=2.8×10(-2)) even when these three haplotype-environment interactions were simultaneously estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RBP4 haplotypes may be important in genetically modulating renal function in response to environmental challenges among patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
