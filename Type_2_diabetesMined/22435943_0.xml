<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: It is well known that a decline in physical activity is associated with lifestyle-related diseases including cardiovascular (CV) events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the association between physical activity and CV events in elderly patients, because recent accumulating reports have mainly dealt with middle-aged populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the correlation between physical activity and CV events in Japanese elderly patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 938 Japanese elderly patients with T2DM (447 men and 491 women, mean age 71.9 years) enrolled (2000-2002) in the Japanese Elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Trial (J-EDIT) were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical activity consisting of three components, work, sports and leisure-time, of their lifestyle was evaluated using the Baecke questionnaire at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total activity score (TAS) as a sum of each activity score was divided into four quartiles (Q1 to Q4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a follow-up period of 65.2 months, 165 events and 71 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in total occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher TAS grade was associated with reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events (hazard ratios: 0.82, 0.77 and 0.54 in Q2, Q3 and Q4, respectively) with statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even after multivariate adjustment for covariates, higher TAS grade was a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events, and the prediction by TAS of cerebrovascular events was more effective than that of cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality gradually decreased according to TAS grade; however, no statistical significance was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the four grades of TAS, no significant change in several parameters, such as profiles of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, blood pressure, physical measurements, cognitive function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale, was found throughout the follow-up period, suggesting that the higher level of physical activity itself was associated with the risk reduction of primary events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lower physical activity is a strong and independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CV events in the elderly with T2DM beyond traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition to strict management of each atherosclerotic risk factor, engagement with patients to augment and maintain the level of physical activity in their lifestyle is also essential in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
