<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: World-wide healthcare systems are faced with an epidemic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the United Kingdom, clinical care is primarily provided by general practitioners (GPs) rather than hospital specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intermediate care clinics for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (ICCD) potentially provide a model for supporting GPs in their care of people with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in their management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aims to (1) compare patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registered with practices that have access to an ICCD service with those that have access only to usual hospital care; (2) assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention; and (3) explore the views and experiences of patients, health professionals and other stakeholders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (with integral economic evaluation and qualitative study) is set in general practices in three UK Primary Care Trusts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Practices are randomized to one of two groups with patients referred to either an ICCD (intervention) or to hospital care (control).Intervention group: GP practices in the intervention arm have the opportunity to refer patients to an ICCD - a multidisciplinary team led by a specialist nurse and a diabetologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients are reviewed and managed in the ICCD for a short period with a goal of improving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> control and are then referred back to practice.orControl group: Standard GP care, with referral to secondary care as required, but no access to ICCD.Participants are adults aged 18 years or older who have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that is difficult for their GPs to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is the proportion of participants reaching three risk factor targets: HbA1c (&lt;=7.0%); blood pressure (&lt;140/80); and cholesterol (&lt;4 mmol/l), at the end of the 18-month intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main secondary outcomes are the proportion of participants reaching individual risk factor targets and the overall 10-year risks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>(CHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> assessed by the United Kingdom Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) risk engine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other secondary outcomes include body mass index and waist circumference, use of medication, reported smoking, emotional adjustment, patient satisfaction and views on continuity, costs and health related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We aimed to randomize 50 practices and recruit 2,555 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Forty-nine practices have been randomized, 1,997 patients have been recruited to the trial, and 20 patients have been recruited to the qualitative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results will be available late 2012.Trial registration[ClinicalTrials.gov: Identifier NCT00945204] </plain></SENT>
