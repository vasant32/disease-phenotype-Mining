<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the past decade, the genetic basis of various monogenic forms of the disease, and their underlying molecular mechanisms, have been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many genes that increase type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) risk have also been identified, but how they do so remains enigmatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, defective insulin secretion emerges as the main culprit in both monogenic and polygenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with environmental and lifestyle factors, via <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, accounting for the current dramatic increase in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There also have been significant advances in therapy, particularly for some monogenic disorders </plain></SENT>
