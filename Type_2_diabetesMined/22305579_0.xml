<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A computerized database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 30 years and over (n = 5008) enrolled in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care Management Program of China Medical University Hospital before 2007 was used in a time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mortality rates were 8.64, 12.71, and 30.82 per 1000 person-years in groups of first, second, and third tertiles of baseline FPG-CV, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 336, 1191, 914, 585, and 1979 patients provided 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more years of annual FPG-CV measurements, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for mean FPG, mean HbA(1C), HbA(1C) variation, and other risk factors, annual FPG-CV was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and mortality due to expanded and nonexpanded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and the corresponding hazard ratios for third versus first tertile of annual FPG-CV were 5.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.85-7.94), 3.21 (95% CI, 2.00-5.15), and 9.45 (95% CI, 5.37-16.63), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Time-dependent variation of FPG was a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause, expanded, and nonexpanded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>-related mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variation may become a measure in clinical practice for the goal in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
