<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found for the first time that ucOC is positively associated with free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The ucOC has been shown to play a key role in energy metabolism as an <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although a recent animal study demonstrated that ucOC is also important for male fertility and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> production by the testes, association between serum osteocalcin and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels has not been understood in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited and chemical bone markers [total osteocalcin (TOC), ucOC, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29022">BAP</z:chebi>), and urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (uNTX)], gonadotropic hormones [luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)], and free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (FT) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed that ucOC and ucOC/TOC ratio were associated positively with FT and negatively with LH (for ucOC, β = 0.30, p = 0.042 and β = -0.52, p = 0.048; for ucOC/TOC ratio, β = 0.31, p = 0.031 and β = -0.54, p = 0.036, respectively) independently of age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, body mass index, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ucOC and ucOC/TOC ratio were significantly associated with FT even after adjusting for LH and FSH (β = 0.24, p = 0.042 and β = 0.25, p = 0.031, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, neither TOC, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29022">BAP</z:chebi>, nor uNTX was associated with the gonadotropic hormones or FT levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates for the first time that ucOC is associated positively with FT and negatively with LH in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the recent evidence that ucOC is involved in <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> production in male subjects </plain></SENT>
