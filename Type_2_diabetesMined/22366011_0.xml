<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) in black and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011364'>white hair</z:hpo> of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MtDNA was extracted from the hair shaft of the patients to amplify two target DNA fragment from mtDNA coding region and control region using PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The differences in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the target DNA fragment was analyzed between diabetic patients and the control group with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control subjects and diabetic patients, the mtDNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the black hair was 3% and 10% in 20-45 year-old groups and 9% and 17% in 45-70 year-old groups, as compared to 9%, 20%, 21%, and 40% in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011364'>white hair</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mtDNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the black and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011364'>white hair</z:hpo> was both higher in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects of the same age group, and was also higher in older age subgroups in both control and diabetic groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011364'>white hair</z:hpo> mtDNA showed a significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> than the black hair mtDNA in the two age groups of diabetic patients and in 45-70 year-old control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mtDNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the hair increases in type 2 diabetic patients and show an association with aging </plain></SENT>
