<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> levels on plasma <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> (LA) levels in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fasting whole blood specimens of 392 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n=199) or not (n=193) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LA was measured with an enzyme-electrode assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of sex hormones, including <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (T) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E(2)), were measured with a chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spearman's or Pearson's correlation and logistic regression analysis were performed for the factors associated with LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LA level in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group was significantly higher than that in the non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group (1.26±0.43 vs. 1.14±0.49 mmol/L, P&lt;0.001), and LA levels of females were significantly higher than those of males (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LA concentrations were positively correlated with E(2) level but negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and T levels (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression analysis showed that gender, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, E(2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and T were independent factors influencing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of subgroups demonstrated that the LA concentrations increased with the elevation of E(2) level (P&lt;0.05) but decreased with the rising of T level (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sex hormones play an important role on regulating plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>E(2) up-regulates but T tend to down-regulate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
