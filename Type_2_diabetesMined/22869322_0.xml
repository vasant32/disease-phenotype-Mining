<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between ghrelin isoforms (acylated and desacyl ghrelin) and TNF-α in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as well as the potential role of ghrelin in the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy in human adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma concentrations of the ghrelin isoforms and TNF-α were measured in 194 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin and ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) levels were analysed by western-blot, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR in 53 biopsies of human omental adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also determined the effect of acylated and desacyl ghrelin (10 to 1,000 pmol/l) on TNF-α-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy-related molecules in omental adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating concentrations of acylated ghrelin and TNF-α were increased, whereas desacyl ghrelin levels were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin and GOAT were produced in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visceral adipose tissue from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed higher levels of GOAT, increased adipocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and increased expression of the autophagy-related genes ATG5, BECN1 and ATG7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In differentiating human omental adipocytes, incubation with acylated and desacyl ghrelin reduced TNF-α-induced activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, acylated ghrelin reduced the basal expression of the autophagy-related genes ATG5 and ATG7, while desacyl ghrelin inhibited the TNF-α-induced increase of ATG5, BECN1 and ATG7 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy are upregulated in human visceral adipose tissue of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Acylated and desacyl ghrelin reduce TNF-α-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy in human visceral adipocytes </plain></SENT>
