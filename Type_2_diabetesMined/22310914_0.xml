<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proteomic technology may provide a useful approach to identify novel protein patterns potentially related to pathophysiological changes that lead up to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to identify protein signals that are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in a middle-aged population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from 519 participants in a nested case-control selection (167 cases and 352 age-, sex- and BMI-matched normoglycemic control subjects, median follow-up 14.0Â years) within the Whitehall-II cohort were analyzed by linear matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine protein peaks were found to be associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rate ratios for high peak intensity ranged between 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) and 4.0 (95% CI, 1.7-9.2) and were robust to adjustment for main potential confounders, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proteins associated with these peaks may reflect <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study exemplifies the utility of an approach that combines proteomic and epidemiological data </plain></SENT>
