<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Population-based case-control study was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interaction between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> family history and abnormal WHR was analysed by an additive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting confounding factors by multiple logistic regression analysis, the synergy index was 5.63, the attributable risk was 1.49, and the attributable interaction percent was 52.9% </plain></SENT>
