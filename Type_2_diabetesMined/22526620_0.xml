<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This lack of insulin causes a variety of systemic effects on whole-body metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Poorly managed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e>, and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increasingly, even well-managed type 1 diabetic patients show damage to peripheral organs related to complications from the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The central role of insulin in energy homeostasis also renders it an important signaling factor in the reproductive tract. type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has now been demonstrated to cause defects in sperm and testes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to present the known effects of insulin's role in the function of the male reproductive tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects might be mediated through hormonal alterations in the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis or through the direct interaction of insulin on the testes and sperm cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although fertility complications also occur in type 2 diabetic males, this review will focus on the defects specifically linked with the lack of insulin seen in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
