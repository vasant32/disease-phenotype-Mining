<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the daily intake of three grams cinnamon over eight weeks on glycemic status, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles and body composition in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial was conducted on 44 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to take either a three g/day cinnamon supplement (n=22) or a placebo (n=22) for eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight, height, body fat mass and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at baseline and after intervention </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in glycemic status indicators, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and anthropometric indicators between the groups at the end of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that cinnamon may have a moderate effect in improving glycemic status indicators </plain></SENT>
