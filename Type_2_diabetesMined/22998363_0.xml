<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Basal insulin provides an effective method for initiating insulin therapy in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, resulting in significant improvements in glycaemic control, lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than either prandial or premixed insulin regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the progressive nature of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the inability of basal insulin to correct excessive postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions mean that insulin therapy will eventually need to be intensified, typically by adding prandial insulin as part of a basal-bolus or premixed insulin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to summarize recent clinical evidence for a staged 'basal-plus' strategy for insulin intensification where one, two or three prandial insulin injections are added to basal insulin according to individual need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the early stages of insulin therapy, most individuals seem to achieve favourable glycaemic control with basal insulin alone, or in combination with a single prandial insulin injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition of a single prandial insulin injection at the largest meal is well tolerated and associated with significant improvements in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c) ), low rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and limited <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More people achieve recommended HbA(1c) targets with a basal-plus strategy, compared with twice-daily premixed insulin therapy, with lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that a step-by-step approach with the basal-plus strategy is a promising alternative method of insulin intensification that allows for individualization of treatment and may delay progression to a full basal-bolus insulin replacement therapy for many individuals. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
