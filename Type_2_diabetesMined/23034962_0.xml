<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Limited evidence from human and animal studies has suggested that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> has a potentially beneficial role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi> intake and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in elderly subjects at high cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional associations were tested in 1925 men and women in the Prevention with the Mediterranean Diet trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal analysis was conducted on 1069 individuals free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline (median follow-up: 5.5 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and anthropometric variables were obtained yearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake was collected during each annual visit by using a food-frequency questionnaire, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi> intake was estimated by using the USDA database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during follow-up was assessed by using American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi> at baseline was significantly lower in subjects who developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 17% lower for each additional intake of 100 Î¼g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi>/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, subjects who increased their dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> during the follow-up had a 51% reduced risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with subjects who decreased or did not change the amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi> intake is associated with reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
