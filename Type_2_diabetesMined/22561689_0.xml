<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pal-Ex4 and Ex4 in solution (each 50 Î¼l) were administered using a microsprayer directly into the trachea of type 2 diabetic db/db mice at 75 or 150 nmol/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lung depositions of Cy5.5-labeled Ex4 or Pal-Ex4 were monitored using an infrared imaging system after administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> caused by Pal-Ex4 was found to be 3.4 and 2.3 times greater than that caused by native Ex4 at 75 and 150 nmol/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, time to blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level (BGL) rebound to &gt;150 mg/dl for Pal-Ex4 was 3.5 times greater than that of Ex4 (18.1 h vs. 5.2 h at 150 nmol/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, the time taken for Pal-Ex4 to reach a BGL nadir was significantly greater than that of Ex4 (~8 h versus 4 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lung deposition images clearly showed that Pal-Ex4 was slowly absorbed from lungs and barely distributed into kidneys until 8 h post-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> exhibited by Pal-Ex4 was due to; (i) delayed absorption in the lungs and (ii) albumin-binding in the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi>-modified exendin-4 should be viewed as a long-acting inhalation candidate for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
