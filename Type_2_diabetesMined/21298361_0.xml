<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate whether screening for asymptomatic CAD can have an impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this nonrandomized longitudinal study, 1,189 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients without a history of CAD were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were subdivided into two groups according to whether they were screened (screening group, n = 921) or not (no-screening group, n = 268) for asymptomatic CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the screened patients, 386 had angiographically proven CAD (CAD group) and 535 did not have silent CAD (no-CAD group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 4.3 Â± 1.9 years, 130 patients experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of MACE was significantly greater in the no-screening than in the screening group (22.0 vs. 7.7%; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method showed that: (1) the screening was associated with a lower rate of MACE (log-rank test, 3-95; p = 0.047); (2) the no-screening group had a risk profile similar to that of CAD group (log-rank test, 2.02; p = 0.154); and (3) cardiovascular prognosis was significantly better in no-CAD than in no-screening group (log-rank test, 4.27; p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that screening for CAD (HR 0.2; 95% CI 0.2-0.3; p = 0.000) was significantly protective against the occurrence of MACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that screening for asymptomatic CAD can significantly reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may be due to specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in diabetic patients with proven CAD at screening </plain></SENT>
