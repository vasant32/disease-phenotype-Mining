<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a population-based prospective study in a population from southern Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first phase of the study (1996-1998) included 1226 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of this original cohort, 988 persons were reassessed in 2002-2004 and 961 in 2005-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and intact parathyroid hormone in 2002-2004 and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was done in three time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels â‰¤ 18.5 ng/mL (percentile 25) was 12.4% vs 4.7% in subjects with levels &gt;18.5 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the four years of follow-up was significantly lower in the subjects with higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [OR = 0.17 (0.05-0.61)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the subjects with levels higher than 30 ng/mL developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this prospective study, we found a significant inverse association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population from the south of Spain </plain></SENT>
