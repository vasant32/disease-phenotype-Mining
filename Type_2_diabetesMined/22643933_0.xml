<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty years ago, Hales and Barker along with their co-workers published some of their pioneering papers proposing the 'thrifty phenotype hypothesis' in Diabetologia (4;35:595-601 and 3;36:62-67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their postulate that fetal programming could represent an important player in the origin of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) was met with great scepticism.More recently, their observations have been confirmed and expanded in many epidemiological and animal experimental studies, and human integrative physiological studies have provided insights into some of the underlying molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a multiple-organ disease, and developmental programming, with its idea of organ plasticity, is a plausible hypothesis for a common basis for the widespread organ dysfunctions in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only two among the 45 known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo>, indicating that the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is mainly non-genetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevention programmes targeting adult lifestyle factors seems unable to stop the global propagation of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control is inadequate to reduce the excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Today, the thrifty phenotype hypothesis has been established as a promising conceptual framework for a more sustainable intergenerational prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
