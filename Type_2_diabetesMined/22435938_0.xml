<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the status of nutritional intake in elderly Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 65 years or older, and to clarify relations of nutritional intake to age, sex and body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinical parameters and nutritional intake were investigated and compared in 912 (417 men, 495 women) elderly Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registered to the Japanese Elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean daily energy intake of patients was 1802 kcal in men and 1661 kcal in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The energy intakes per kilogram of standard bodyweight in both sexes and the energy intakes per kilogram of present bodyweight in men increased significantly with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein : fat : carbohydrate (PFC) energy ratio (%E) was 15.2:25.4:59.5 in men, and 15.7:25.8:58.6 in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grain, oil, alcohol and soft drink intakes were higher in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Potato, fruit and green vegetable intakes were higher in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fruit intake showed a significant age-related increase in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, there was an age-related significant decrease of meat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increase of BMI correlated with a significant increase in bodyweight, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean energy intake of three BMI groups, lean (BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m(2)), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (18.5 kg/m(2) &lt;/= BMI &lt; 25 kg/m(2) ) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (25 kg/m(2) &lt;/= BMI), were 1625, 1796 and 1839 kcal in men, and 1655, 1647 and 1685 kcal in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, BMI-related increase of energy intake did not reach statistically significant levels in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Energyintake per kilogram of present bodyweight decreased as BMI increased in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Energy intake per kilogram of standard bodyweight increased significantly as BMI increased in men only, but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in PFC energy ratios among the three BMI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast, intake of soft drinks in men increased significantly as BMI increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In women, intakes of alcohol and soft drink increased significantly as BMI increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An increased energy intake per kilogram of standard bodyweight correlated with increase of BMI in men, but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Intakes of soft drinks in both sexes and alcohol in women correlated with increase of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These results suggest there are sex differences in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in elderly type 2 diabetic patients from an aspect of nutritional intake </plain></SENT>
