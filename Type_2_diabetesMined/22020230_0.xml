<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological literature suggests a bi-directional relationship between these two common disorders, and evidence from the molecular sciences supports a role for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of each disorder individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in understanding the neurobiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> have implicated dysfunction of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, neurotrophins, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> in the development of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, dysregulated facets of both the innate and adaptive immune system have been implicated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review draws upon an emerging body of epidemiological and mechanistic evidence to support the hypothesis that shared inflammatory mechanisms may represent a key biological link in this co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the shared mechanisms of this co-morbidity, these patients may be excellent candidates for novel immune targeted pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
