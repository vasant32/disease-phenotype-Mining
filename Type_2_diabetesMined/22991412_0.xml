<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in circulating levels of adipokines, factors released from adipose tissue, form a significant link between excessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and both aforementioned factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review we consider the published evidence for the role of individual adipokines on the function, proliferation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and failure of beta-cells, focusing on those reported to have the most significant effects (leptin, adiponectin, TNFÎ±, resistin, visfatin, DPP-IV and apelin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is apparent that some adipokines have beneficial effects whereas others have detrimental properties; the overall contribution to beta-cell failure of changed concentrations of adipokines in the blood of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> subjects will be highly dependent on the balance between these effects and the interactions between the adipokines which act on the beta-cell via a number of intersecting intracellular signalling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We emphasise the importance, and comparative dearth, of studies into the combined effects of adipokines on beta-cells </plain></SENT>
