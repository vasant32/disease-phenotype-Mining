<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the relationships between TFA biomarkers and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in Chinese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Erythrocyte fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography among 3,107 men and women (50-70 years) recruited from urban and rural areas in Beijing and Shanghai, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total trans-18:1 and two trans-18:2 isomers were detected and accounted for 0.37% of the total fatty acids in the erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of TFAs were higher in women than men, and in urban than rural residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the TFAs, trans-18:1, but not trans-18:2, showed a modest association with dairy consumption (β = 0.27), but not with other foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for BMI, social-demographic, lifestyle and dietary factors and other TFAs, erythrocyte trans-18:1 was shown to be associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR comparing extreme [first and fourth] quartiles 0.68, 95% CI 0.48, 0.97, p (trend) = 0.02), as well as 20-50% lower odds of central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, trans-18:2 fatty acids were positively associated with high triacylglycerol (p (trend) &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (p (trend) = 0.03) levels, but not with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other cardiometabolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Among middle-aged and older Chinese individuals with overall low erythrocyte TFAs levels, trans-18:1 might serve as a marker of dairy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher trans-18:1 levels were associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas higher trans-18:2 levels were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
