<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the difficulty in measuring CETP activity, the aim was to identify simple biochemical predictors of high CETP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty five subjects at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were classified according to the presence of MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile, HOMA-IR and endogenous CETP activity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, MS patients presented higher concentration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MS patients exhibited increased HOMA-IR and CETP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Employing a ROC curve for MS, high CETP activity was defined as &gt;250%ml⁻¹ h⁻¹ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predictive variables of high CETP were non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>≥160mg/dl (OR=11.1;95%IC=3.3-38.2;p&lt;0.001) and HOMA-IR&gt;2.1 (OR=4.4;95%IC=1.3-14.8;p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were predictors for increased CETP activity which measurement is not accessible for clinical laboratories </plain></SENT>
