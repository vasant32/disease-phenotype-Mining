<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 2,460 primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed for demographic, clinical and psychological factors in 2005 and followed-up in 2007 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was defined as a score of â‰¥ 12 on the Edinburgh <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether several <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-course patterns could be predicted by means of demographics, medical co-morbidities and psychological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 630 patients (26%) met the criterion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at one or more assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup with no baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at follow-up was present in 14% (n = 310), while recurrence/persistence in those with baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was found in 66% (n = 212).The presence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was associated with being female, low education, non-cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases, stressful life events and a self-reported history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was predicted by female sex, low education and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> history, while patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> had a 2.5-fold increased odds of recurrent/persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> is common in primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with one in seven patients reporting incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> during a 2.5 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Once present, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> often becomes a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>/recurrent condition in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In order to identify patients who are vulnerable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, clinicians can use questionnaire data and/or information about the history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
