<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the effectiveness of self-audit tools designed to detect miscoding, misclassification and misdiagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed six searches to identify people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with potential classification errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The search results were automatically ranked from most to least likely to have an underlying problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight practices with a combined population of 72,000 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence 2.9% (n = 2340) completed audit forms to verify whether additional information within the patients' medical record confirmed or refuted the problems identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The searches identified 347 records, mean 42 per practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-audit 20% (n = 69) had Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 70% (n = 241) had Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 9% (n = 30) had vague codes that were hard to classify, 2% (n = 6) were not coded and one person was labelled as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of records, 39.2% (n = 136) had important errors: 10% (n = 35) had coding errors; 12.1% (42) were misclassified; and 17.0% (59) misdiagnosed as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two per cent (n = 22) of people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 69) were misclassified as having Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 20% (n = 48) of people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 241) did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; of the 30 patients with vague diagnostic terms, 50% had Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 20% had Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20% did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examples of misdiagnosis were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> practices, misclassification in seven and miscoding in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Volunteer practices successfully used these self-audit tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately 40% of patients identified by computer searches (5.8% of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) had errors; misdiagnosis is commonest, misclassification may affect treatment options and miscoding in omission from disease registers and the potential for reduced quality of care </plain></SENT>
