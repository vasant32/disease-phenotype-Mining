<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, the orally active DPP-4 inhibitors have established themselves as insulinotropic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their advantage is the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic action without an intrinsic risk for causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally DPP-4 inhibitors have a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dependent glucagonostatic action contributing to improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are weight neutral and show a good safety and tolerability profile with comparable efficacy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin is a novel DPP-4 inhibitor with a distinct pharmacological profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the other approved DPP-4 inhibitors it is eliminated by a hepatic/biliary route rather than a renal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In clinical studies, it has been shown to be non-inferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> treatment regarding glycemic parameters, but to possess favourable safety advantages regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> frequency, body weight development and effects on cardioavascular parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This article gives an overview on the pharmacology of linagliptin as well as on the clinical data available </plain></SENT>
