<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the association between zinc and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we recruited 75 patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 75 nondiabetic sex-/age-matched control subjects in order to analyze differences concerning human zinc transporter 8 (hZnT-8) expression, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of hZnT-8 as well as metallothionein 1A and serum/intracellular zinc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated the relation between insulin and zinc homeostasis in type 2 diabetic subjects and consolidated our results by in vitro analysis of the effect of insulin on cellular zinc status and by analysis of the modulation of insulin signal transduction by intracellular zinc homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concerning the expression of hZnT-8 and the SNPs analyzed, we did not observe any differences between diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum zinc was significantly lower in diabetic patients compared to controls, and intracellular zinc showed the same tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with insulin displayed lower serum zinc compared to those not injecting insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro analyses showed that insulin leads to an increase in intracellular zinc and that insulin signaling was enhanced by elevated intracellular zinc concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we show that type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients suffer from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">zinc deficiency</z:e>, and our results indicate that zinc supplementation may qualify as a potential treatment adjunct in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by promoting insulin signaling, especially in zinc-deficient subjects </plain></SENT>
