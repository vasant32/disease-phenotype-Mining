<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the potential efficacy of the VPAC2 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> Bay 55-9837 against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in type-2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GK rats were treated intravenously once daily for 7days with 0.25 or 0.025nmol/kg Bay 55-9837 or vehicle before inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatments were then continued for 7 further days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The glycemic effects of Bay 55-9837 were assessed by measuring fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was measured by assessing ischemic volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that Bay 55-9837 is not effective in lowering fasting glycemia and does not facilitate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest dose of Bay 55-9837 (0.25nmol/kg) led to increased mortality and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> when compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lower dose of Bay 55-9837 (0.025nmol/kg) did not increase mortality rate but caused a threefold increase of the ischemic lesion size with signs of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> as compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Bay 55-9837 did not show <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> or antistroke efficacy in the type 2 diabetic GK rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Contrarily, Bay 55-9837 treatment led to increased mortality and worsening of the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
