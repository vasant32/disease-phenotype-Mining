<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between daily salt intake and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, a marker of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We classified 270 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who were not receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication into four groups according to their daily salt intake (&lt;8, 8-10, 10-12 and &gt;12 g per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between daily salt intake and the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariate linear regression analysis was used to evaluate whether daily salt intake independently correlated with the logarithm of UAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we assessed the contribution of the variables, including age, sex, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1C), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, alcohol intake, smoking status and square of (daily salt intake-10) on <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, defined as a UAE&gt;30 mg g(-1) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, using a multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The logarithm of the UAE was lowest in the third quartile of daily salt intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that the logarithm of the UAE was significantly correlated with the quadratic term of daily salt intake centered at 10 g per day (β=0.170, P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was 3.996 (1.295-12.327; P=0.016) in patients whose daily salt intake was less than 8 g per day compared with patients whose daily salt intake was 10-12 g per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, low daily salt intake was correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who were not receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication.<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> Research advance online publication, 26 July 2012; doi:10.1038/hr.2012.116 </plain></SENT>
