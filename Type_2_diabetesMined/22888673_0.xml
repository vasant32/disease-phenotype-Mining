<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medico-social role of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is defined by wide prevalence of a disease in population and high risk of development of incapacitating complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, considerable efforts of modern medicine focused on the study of etio-pathogenetic mechanism and the possibility of dietetic correction in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review discusses efficacy of dietary therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the role of insulin-like growth 1 (IGF-1)/insulin of pathogenesis microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the development of microvascular complications, in the first place cytokines, act on the insulin signal pathway and affect the intracellular inflammatory kinase cascade was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, it is shown that adipose tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> modulates B-cell function and promotes progressive reduction of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels are elevated, Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>--1 stimulates insulin secretion, decrease glucagon secretion, improve B-cell function, and slows gastric emptying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It determines the necessity of fulfillment of further researches of cellular and humoral immunity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and the development of personal methods in prevention and treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
