<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To which extent such screening is actually performed is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 2,057 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly selected from 64 general practitioners (GPs) from different geographical areas of Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory data on the individual patients were collected through the GPs' electronic medical patient records; particular emphasis was given to annual screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 66.2 Â± 11.6 years and 58.7% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 57.2% of the patients had been screened for <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> with any method within the preceding 12 months period; of these 76.0% had normo- and 21.0% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, whereas 3.0% had overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 97.6% of patients had had a minimum of one plasma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> measurement within the past year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In Danish primary care, screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is insufficiently implemented, whereas renal function is evaluated in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by plasma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The importance of diagnosing <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> needs to be emphasised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FUNDING: The project has received funding in the form of a research grant from Boehringer Ingelheim, Denmark </plain></SENT>
