<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present an approximate conditional and joint association analysis that can use summary-level statistics from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) from a reference sample with individual-level genotype data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this method, we analyzed meta-analysis summary data from the GIANT Consortium for height and body mass index (BMI), with the LD structure estimated from genotype data in two independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 36 loci with multiple associated variants for height (38 leading and 49 additional SNPs, 87 in total) via a genome-wide SNP selection procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 49 new SNPs explain approximately 1.3% of variance, nearly doubling the heritability explained at the 36 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not find any locus showing multiple associated SNPs for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method we present is computationally fast and is also applicable to case-control data, which we demonstrate in an example from meta-analysis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by the DIAGRAM Consortium </plain></SENT>
