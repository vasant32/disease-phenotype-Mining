<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The devastating impact of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) on vascular, renal, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi>, and peripheral nerve functions has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is also evidence that older adults with this disease exhibit impairments in the planning, coordinating, sequencing, and monitoring of cognitive operations, collectively known as executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although poorly understood, disturbances in executive function, particularly within the dimension of time sharing, may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait abnormalities</z:hpo> and increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, functional impairments, and disabilities associated with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the relationships between executive function and functional abilities remain poorly understood in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current neuropsychological research regarding the concept of executive function is presented here as a framework upon which to examine the integrity of this critical cognitive entity in adults with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological mechanisms thought to underlie <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related executive dysfunction are explored, and the possible contributions of executive deficits to impairments in gait and function observed in older people with type 2 DM are summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, a brief discussion of dual-task assessment and intervention strategies that may facilitate the care and rehabilitation of the growing population of patients with type 2 DM is provided </plain></SENT>
