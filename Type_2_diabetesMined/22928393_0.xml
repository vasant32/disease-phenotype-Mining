<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of type 2 diabetic patients regularly attending a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> program was selected according to specific criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, medical and periodontal variables were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A randomized half-mouth examination was performed, including plaque index, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> on probing, pocket depth and clinical attachment level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were compared to a group of individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, based on different criteria; the first was the presence of &gt; or = 2 interproximal sites with CAL &gt; or = 6 mm, and &gt; or = 1 interproximal sites with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> &gt; or = 5 mm; the second was presence of &gt; or = 50% percentage of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> on probing, and &gt; or = 20% sites showing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> &gt; or = 4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of metabolic control was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were tested through Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson correlation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were compared to 39 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of a similar age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects had a fair degree of metabolic control, HbA1c 7.94% (1.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> was similar for both groups when using diagnostic criteria based on CAL levels, 22.22%, but was greater for subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when using criteria based on periodontal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, 23.07% versus 5.12% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colombian type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subjects demonstrated poorer periodontal conditions than non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
