<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) and Framingham risk equations for predicting short-term risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) events among adults with long-standing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including those with and without preexisting CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective cohort of U.S. managed care enrollees aged ≥ 18 years and mean <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of more than 10 years, participating in the Translating Research into Action for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (TRIAD) study, was followed for the first occurrence of CHD events from 2000 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The UKPDS and Framingham risk equations were evaluated for discriminating power and calibration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 8303 TRIAD participants, were identified to evaluate the UKPDS (n = 5914, 120 events), Framingham-initial (n = 5914, 218 events) and Framingham-secondary (n = 2389, 374 events) risk equations, according to their prior CHD history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these equations exhibited low discriminating power with Harrell's c-index &lt;0.65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except the Framingham-initial equation for women and the Framingham-secondary equation for men had low levels of calibration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjsusting for the average values of predictors and event rates in the TRIAD population, the calibration of these equations greatly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The UKPDS and Framingham risk equations may be inappropriate for predicting the short-term risk of CHD events in patients with long-standing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, partly due to changes in medications used by patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other improvements in clinical care since the Frmaingham and UKPDS studies were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Refinement of these equations to reflect contemporary CHD profiles, diagnostics and therapies are needed to provide reliable risk estimates to inform effective treatment </plain></SENT>
