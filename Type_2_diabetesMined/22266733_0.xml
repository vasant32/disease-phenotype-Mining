<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We compared acylcarnitine (AcylCN) species, common amino acid and fat oxidation (FOX) byproducts, and plasma amino acids in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (NW; n = 39), <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (OB; n = 64), and type 2 diabetic (n = 17) adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting plasma was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography, and total-body lipolysis and substrate oxidation by [(2)H(5)]<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> and indirect calorimetry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo insulin sensitivity (IS) was assessed with a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Long-chain AcylCNs (C18:2-CN to C14:0-CN) were similar among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medium- to short-chain AcylCNs (except C8 and C10) were significantly lower in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with NW, and when compared with OB, <z:chebi fb="110" ids="30082">C2-</z:chebi>, C6-, and C10-CN were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amino acid concentrations were lower in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with NW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting lipolysis and FOX were higher in OB and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with NW, and the negative association of FOX to C10:1 disappeared after controlling for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, Tanner stage, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IS was lower in OB and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with positive associations between IS and arginine, histidine, and serine after adjusting for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, Tanner stage, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These metabolomics results, together with the increased rates of in vivo FOX, are not supportive of defective fatty acid or amino acid metabolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such observations are consistent with early adaptive metabolic plasticity in youth, which over time-with continued <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and aging-may become dysfunctional, as observed in adults </plain></SENT>
