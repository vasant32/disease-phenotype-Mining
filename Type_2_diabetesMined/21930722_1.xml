<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Detailed medical histories were obtained from 13â€ˆ025 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals were categorised as having no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on the 2010 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria at study baseline (1990-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnoses of incident AF were obtained to the end of 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and markers of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and the incidence of AF were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with a significant increase in the risk of AF (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.60) after adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no indication that individuals with pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or those with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were at increased risk of AF compared with those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positive linear association was observed between HbA1c and the risk of AF in those with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.20) and HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15 per 1% point increase, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no association between fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin in those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but a significant association with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was found in those with the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results were similar in white subjects and African-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c level and poor glycaemic control are independently associated with an increased risk of AF, but the underlying mechanisms governing the relationship are unknown and warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
