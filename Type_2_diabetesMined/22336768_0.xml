<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationships between ABI or TBI and the degree of urinary albumin excretion or eGFR, as well as the major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, in 390 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we compared the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) of TBI or ABI for <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was negatively associated with ABI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were negatively associated with TBI, and diastolic blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> were positively associated with TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Log (urinary albumin excretion) was associated more strongly with TBI (r=-0.265, P&lt;0.0001) than with ABI (r=-0.132, P=0.0111), and eGFR was positively associated with TBI (r=0.195, P=0.0002) but not with ABI (r=0.023, P=0.6571) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AUCs of TBI for <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (P=0.0002) and CKD (P=0.0322) were significantly greater than those of ABI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TBI is associated more strongly with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and eGFR than ABI in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that TBI may be a more suitable tool for evaluating the association between PAD and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than ABI in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
