<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objective:  To investigate the association between alcohol consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and determine whether this is modified by sex, body mass index (BMI) and beverage type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Design:  Multicentre prospective case-cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Setting:  Eight countries from the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects:  A representative baseline sample of 16,154 participants and 12,403 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interventions:  Alcohol consumption assessed using validated dietary questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures:  Occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on multiple sources (mainly self-reports), verified against medical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results:  Among men, moderate alcohol consumption was non-significantly associated with a lower incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.78-1.05) for 6.1-12.0 g/day versus 0.1-6.0 g/day, adjusted for dietary and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the lowest risk was observed at higher intakes of 24.1-96.0 g/day with an HR of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among women, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72-0.92) for 6.1-12.0 g/day (P interaction gender &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inverse association between alcohol consumption and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was more pronounced among overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) ) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight men and women (P interaction &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for waist and hip circumference did not alter the results for men, but attenuated the association for women (HR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.79-1.03 for 6.1-12.0 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Wine consumption for men and fortified wine consumption for women were most strongly associated with a reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  The results of this study show that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, this risk reduction is in part explained by fat distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The relation between alcohol consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was stronger for overweight than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight women and men </plain></SENT>
