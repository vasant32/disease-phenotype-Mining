<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the clinical significance of DR in normoalbuminuric type 2 DM patients may be overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of DR and predictors for DR in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total 310 patients with type 2 DM and normoalbuminuria, who were referred to the Department of Ophthalmology for screening of DR were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DR was clinically graded according to the International Clinical Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) was assessed via 24-hour urine collection and measured by immunoturbidimetric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normoalbuminuria was defined as a UAER &lt; 20 μg/min in 2 out of 3 consecutive tests taken within 2-3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DR of any grade was present in 64/310 (20.7 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild non-proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NPDR) was most prevalent in patients with DR of any grade (36/64, 56 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.01, 95 % CI, 1.01 - 1.02, p &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (OR 0.73, 95 % CI, 0.59 - 0.91, p = 0.004) and a higher tertile of UAER (OR 4.04, 95 % CI, 1.71 - 9.57, p = 0.001) had independently significant association with DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NPDR as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> was more prevalent in patients with higher tertile of UAER compared with those with lower tertile of UAER (NPDR, p = 0.002 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>, p = 0.027, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with normoalbuminuric type 2 DM also require close monitoring for the early detection of DR, especially if they have a higher UAER, longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
