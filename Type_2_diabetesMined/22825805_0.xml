<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Non-severe nocturnal hypoglycemic events (NSNHEs) are hypoglycemic events that occur during sleep but do not require medical assistance from another individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to better understand the NSNHEs as patients actually experience them in their daily life, and how they impacted functioning and well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine focus groups were held in four countries with diabetics (Type 1 and Type 2) who had experienced an NSNHE within the previous month: France (2 groups); Germany (2 groups); United Kingdom (2 groups); and United States (3 groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These groups were audio-taped, translated to English where applicable, and analyzed thematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-eight people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in the focus groups: 41 (53 %) were female and 37 (47 %) were male; 24 (31 %) had Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 54 (69 %) had Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participant reports were grouped into several major themes: next day effects, symptoms, sleep impacts, social impacts, corrective action, practical management, feelings about NSNHEs, and work impacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: People with both Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> experience NSNHEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The range of impact on these patients is wide, from very mild to severe with a majority of participants experiencing strong impacts that limit their daily functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that NSNHEs are more impactful than previously believed </plain></SENT>
