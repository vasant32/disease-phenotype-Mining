<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Ginseng has been used as an herbal medicine and <z:chebi fb="10" ids="50733">nutritional supplement</z:chebi> in East Asia for thousands of years and gained popularity in the west because of its various pharmacological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) and Panax quinquefolium (North American ginseng) both are reported to possess antihyperglycemic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the preventive effects of North American ginseng on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) and the underlying mechanisms of such effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Models of both type 1 (C57BL/6 mice with STZ-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (db/db mice) and age- and sex-matched controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alcoholic ginseng root (200mg/kgbodywt, daily oral gavage) extract was administered to the diabetic mice (type 1 and type 2) for two or four months in order to evaluate its effects on DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dysmetabolic state in the diabetic mice was significantly improved by ginseng treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the kidneys of diabetic animals, ginseng significantly prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and reduced the NF-ÎºB (p65) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-induced up-regulations of ECM proteins and vasoactive factors in the kidneys were significantly diminished by ginseng administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and mesangial expansion in the diabetic mice were prevented by ginseng therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: North American ginseng has preventive effects on DN and it works through a combination of mechanisms such as antihyperglycemic and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities </plain></SENT>
