<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) is among the most challenging health issues of the 21st century and is associated with an alarming rise in the incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological processes that lead to development of T2DM are still unclear, however impairment in insulin secretion and/or action is clearly indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a polygenic disorder with multiple genes located on different chromosomes contributing to its susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the genetic factors is further complicated by the fact that numerous environmental factors interact with genes to produce the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only a minority of cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037176" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single gene defects</z:e> and one example is <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicated that variants in genes encoding the pancreatic β-cell K+ATP channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) are associated with neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six different types of maturity <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of young (MODY) have been identified based on characteristic gene defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The common Pro12Ala polymorphism in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) gene was confirmed in several studies to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More recently, studies reported variants within a novel gene, TCF7L2, as a putative susceptibility gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across many ethnic backgrounds around the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MODY patients respond better to sulphonylureas and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, while neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with genetic mutations can be changed from insulin to oral drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We hereby provide a comprehensive review on the role of genetics in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
