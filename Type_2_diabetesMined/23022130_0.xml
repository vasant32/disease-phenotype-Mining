<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Incretin therapies such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4Is) and GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (GLP-1RAs) have become well-established treatments for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both drug classes reduce blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> through physiological pathways mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, resulting in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent enhancement of residual insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the GLP-1RAs reduce gastrointestinal motility and appear to have appetite-suppressing actions and, so, are often able to produce clinically useful <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependency of their glucagon-inhibiting and insulin-enhancing effects, together with their weight-sparing properties, make the incretin therapies a logical proposition for use in combination with exogenous basal insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This combination offers the prospect of an additive or synergistic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect without a greatly elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> compared with insulin monotherapy, and any insulin-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> might also be mitigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the incretin therapies can be combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, which is usually continued when basal insulin is introduced in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the combination of incretin and insulin therapy is currently not addressed in internationally recognized treatment guidelines, several clinical studies have assessed its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data, summarized in this review, are encouraging and show that glycaemic control is improved and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> is limited or reversed (especially with the combined use of GLP-1RAs and basal insulin), and that the use of an incretin therapy can also greatly reduce insulin dose requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of basal insulin to established incretin therapy is straightforward, but insulin dose adjustment (though not discontinuation) is usually necessary if the sequence is reversed </plain></SENT>
