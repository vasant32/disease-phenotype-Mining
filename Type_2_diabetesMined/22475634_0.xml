<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary prevention is a key to prevent this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The objective was to study the situations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> controls in Thai type 2 diabetic patients who had no history of cardiovascular complication at a university hospital in Thailand after the Thai <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management guideline was recently launched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred and fourteen patients were enrolled in the study and 54.3% were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were collected retrospectively from out-patient medical records and an electronic data base for the patients who were followed up at the hospital during January-December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most recent laboratory values were utilized in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 70%-90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were checked for HbA1c and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>) at least once a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was observed that only 28% of the patients had HbA1c&lt;6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the percentages of the patients who had blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg, and who had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>&lt;100 mg/dL were 28% and 41%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even though the practice guideline has been launched since 2008, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> were still poorly controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study is recommended to identify factors influencing these outcomes as well as the policy of diabetic care in Thailand is needed to be seriously implemented </plain></SENT>
