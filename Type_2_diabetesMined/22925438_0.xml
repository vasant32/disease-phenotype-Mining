<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the annual incidence of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among youth and to describe characteristics of youth diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Research Design and Methods: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> residents ≤19 years of age diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between January 2001 and December 2010 were identified from review of medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospitals and confirmed by physician query </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 82 eligible patients were identified and the registry ascertainment was estimated to be 98.7% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall age-adjusted annual incidence rates (per 100 000) of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for the study period were 15.3 (95% CI: 11.3-20.1) and 9.6 (95% CI: 6.8-13.5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased significantly over the study period, with an epidemic-like threefold increase occurring from 2005 (8.7/100 000) to 2006 (26.4/100 000; p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was highest in the 10-19 age group in girls (25.6/100 000), but no age difference was seen in boys, resulting from the lack of a pubertal peak in non-Hispanic Black boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> rose significantly between 2001 (5.3/100 000) and 2010 (12.5/100 000; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth is increasing in the USVI, similar to global patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to explore the missing pubertal rise in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in non-Hispanic Black boys and factors associated with the epidemic-like increases observed over the decade </plain></SENT>
