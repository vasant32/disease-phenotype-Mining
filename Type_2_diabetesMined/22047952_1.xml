<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to epidemiologic studies demonstrating a consistent relationship between decreased levels of serum SHBG and incident T2DM, recent genetic studies also reveal that transmission of specific polymorphisms in the SHBG gene influence the risk of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the molecular level, the multiple interactions between SHBG and its receptors in various target tissues suggest physiologic roles for SHBG that are more complex than the simple transport of sex hormones in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data provide support for an expanded role of SHBG in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and T2DM </plain></SENT>
