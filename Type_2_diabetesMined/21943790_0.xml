<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess (i) whether the reporting of counseling previously received is associated with high-risk individuals' agreement to participate in lifestyle intervention, (ii) whether the reporting of previous counseling differed within such a high-risk group, and (iii) the associations between lifestyles and previous lifestyle counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional data were drawn from 10149 adults at high risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who were participating in a Finnish national <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention project (FIN-D2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In relation to the reporting of previous counseling, no difference was found between persons who had agreed and persons who had not agreed to participate in the lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persons who were more educated or who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more likely than the others to report previous counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A generally healthy lifestyle, or certain health behaviors (being a non-smoker or eating large amounts of fruit and vegetables) may make the reporting of previous counseling more likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results raise questions about the amount and quality of the previously received lifestyle counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: There is a need for sustainable lifestyle counseling structures, within vigorously implemented <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention projects, if long-lasting lifestyle changes are to be achieved </plain></SENT>
