<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cannot or will not exercise sufficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this pilot investigation was to see (1) if it was an acceptable training modality for men with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and (2) to assess effects on <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: A case series of eight men with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (aged 53±8; body mass index 32±5 5 kg/m(2)) trained with the NMES system for 1 h 6 times weekly for 8 weeks, unsupervised, at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no other medication or lifestyle interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aerobic NMES exercise system delivers a repeating set of four complex staggered pulses at high intensities (typically 100 mA+) through an array of eight thigh electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were changes in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c and the responses in a questionnaire on participants' perceptions of the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body mass and composition were also measured before and after the NMES intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants could use the system at a level that left them breathless and sweaty and with a heart rate over 120 beats per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">Haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels improved by 0.8±0.7% from 7.4±1.3% (mean ± SD) to 6.6±1.0% (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants considered the system suitable for people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, would recommend it and would continue to use it twice a week 'to maintain improvements' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that aerobic NMES may be acceptable and have a beneficial effect on <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c of some men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The treatment may be of particular benefit in those who will not or cannot do adequate amounts of voluntary exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A randomised control trial is required for conclusive efficacy data </plain></SENT>
