<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness, as measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), has been known to be correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum ceruloplasmin (CP), a copper-carrying protein, may indicate the overall level of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether serum CP levels are associated with baPWV in Korean men with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects and Methods: Serum CP levels and conventional risk factors were measured in 760 Korean men with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was assessed by baPWV obtained with an automatic device (model VP-1000; Colin, Komaki, Japan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Correlation analysis indicated a significant positive association between serum CP and baPWV (r=0.109, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted baPWV increased gradually according to serum CP quartiles (Q1, 1,500.3±18.4 cm/s; Q2, 1,511.6±17.8 cm/s; Q3, 1,551.8±17.9 cm/s; Q4, 1,622.1±17.8 cm/s; P for trend&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that serum CP was independently associated with baPWV in various models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: A positive relationship was identified between CP and baPWV in adult male subjects with type 2 DM, which was independent of conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm whether CP contributes to the pathogenesis of increased arterial stiffness in subjects with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
