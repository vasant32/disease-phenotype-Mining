<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the characterization of the specific symptom dimensions that develop in diabetic patients with respect to disease phenotype and treatment status remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study comparatively assessed <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> symptoms and cognitive performance using a dimensional approach in 21 patients with insulin-treated type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 24 type 2 diabetic patients either insulin-free or undergoing insulin treatment for at least six months, and 15 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific dimensions of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> were assessed using the Multidimensional-<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp>-Inventory (MFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance on tests of choice reaction time, pattern recognition memory and spatial planning was evaluated using the Cambridge-Neuropsychological-Automated-Battery (CANTAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) and glycated-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1C) concentrations were collected, as well as information on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications and disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, regardless of insulin treatment status, exhibited higher scores of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, primarily in the dimensions of general and physical <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> as well as reduced activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive alterations</z:e>, in the form of longer reaction times and impaired spatial planning, were also detected in type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alterations were overall unrelated to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, as reflected in HbA1C levels, and were not explained by complications and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No specific alteration was measured in type 1 diabetic patients who exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> scores and cognitive performance comparable to healthy participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> did not significantly account for the relationship of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with general <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and physical <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BMI, however, modulated the association of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with reduced activity and the association of insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with psychomotor slowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings reveal specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and cognitive symptoms in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and suggest the involvement of differential pathophysiological processes </plain></SENT>
