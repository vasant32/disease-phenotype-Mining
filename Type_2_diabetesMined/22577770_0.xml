<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the rate of achieving optimal metabolic control among subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, to elucidate the influence of suboptimal control on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) and to analyze the risk factors associated with DR in the subjects with suboptimal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in south India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 1414 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Optimal control of glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> was defined as: optimal HbA1c &lt;7%, suboptimal HbA1c ≥ 7%; optimal BP ≤ 130/80 mm Hg, suboptimal BP &gt;130/80 mm Hg; optimal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) &lt;100 mg/dl, suboptimal <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> ≥ 100 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the subjects, 13.6% achieved combined optimal target levels for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared to subjects with optimal control, those with suboptimal control of HbA1c (trend P &lt; 0.0001) and systolic blood pressure (SBP, trend P = 0.007) were more likely to have DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects having a combination of suboptimal glycemic and BP control (P &lt; 0.0001 for SBP, P = 0.004 for diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>)), and suboptimal glycemic, BP and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> control (P &lt; 0.0001 for SBP, P = 0.017 for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>), were more likely to have DR when compared to the subjects having optimal control of respective combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with DR in the subjects with suboptimal control were younger age (P = 0.014 for BP, P = 0.016 for HbA1c), male gender (P = 0.035 for BP, P = 0.027 for HbA1c, P = 0.043 for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.021 for BP, P = 0.036 for HbA1c) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001 for both BP and HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found high prevalence of suboptimal metabolic control among subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Suboptimal glycemic and SBP control, and their combination was the most detrimental for the development of DR </plain></SENT>
