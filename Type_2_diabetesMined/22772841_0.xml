<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) people are disproportionately diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and incidence is increasing in many Alaska communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Developing effective interventions requires understanding the social and psychological factors that impact effective management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, yet little is known about these factors in AN/AI communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to explore perceived psychosocial needs and barriers to management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among AN/AI adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving care at the Alaska Native Primary Care Center (ANPCC) to inform programmatic efforts and potential future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted three focus groups and five interviews with 13 AN/AI adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interview and focus group questions elicited perceived factors that affect management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with a focus on the psychological, social and spiritual impacts of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were transcribed, coded and analyzed using thematic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Key themes that emerged from these data included resources and roadblocks, as well as turning points in the trajectory of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Resources are factors with a perceived positive impact on management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including: (1) knowledge and education about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, (2) social support from other people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, (3) spirituality, and (4) self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Roadblocks are factors with a perceived negative impact on management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and include: (1) self-reported lack of knowledge about nutrition and diet, (2) social difficulties caused by dietary restrictions, and (3) co-morbid medical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, turning points are experiences described by participants as having transformed roadblocks in resources and thus facilitating improvement in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future programmatic interventions to improve management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with this population should focus on improving dietary education and social support opportunities for newly-diagnosed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also, educational and support opportunities for family members and friends of individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should also be offered to facilitate understanding and support of their loved ones' management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially with regard to dietary restrictions in social settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Efforts should also focus on strengthening newly-diagnosed individuals' self-efficacy and providing ongoing support as individuals progressively adjust to the illness over time and make <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future research with this population should explore the effects of family support groups and the possibility of Web-based or other alternative interventions for improving psychosocial health and management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> efforts </plain></SENT>
