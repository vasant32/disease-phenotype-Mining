<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve Italian centers participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient data refer to bioprosthetic implantations performed from November 1988 to December 2009, which resulted in 6184 patients (mean age 71.3Â±5.4 years, 60.1% male) being enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 1731 (27.9%) had type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The propensity score-matching algorithm successfully matched 1113 patients with type 2 DM with the same number of no-DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postmatching standard differences were less than 0.1 for each of the covariates, and 64.2% of DM patients were matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The early (30 days) mortality rate was 7.8% (n=87) versus 2.9% (n=33) in patients with or without type 2 DM (P&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven-year freedom from valve deterioration was significantly lower in patients with DM (73.2% [95% confidence interval, 61.6-85.5] versus 95.4% [95% confidence interval, 83.9-100], P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression models with robust SEs that accounted for the clustering of matched pairs, DM was the strongest predictor of structural valve degeneration (hazard ratio 2.39 [95% confidence interval 2.28-3.52]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When we allowed for interaction between type 2 DM and other key risk factors, DM remained a significant predictor beyond any potentially associated variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 DM undergoing bioprosthetic valve implantation are at high risk of early and long-term mortality, as well as of structural valve degeneration </plain></SENT>
