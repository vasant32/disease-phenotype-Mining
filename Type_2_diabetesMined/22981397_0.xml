<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study of consecutive type 2 diabetic patients on drug treatment attending an internal medicine outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients (81 treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean time on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment was 43.5 months and mean drug dose was 1,779mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> had significantly lower vitamin B(12) plasma levels (393.5 vs. 509 pg/mL, P = .0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven (8.6%) of 81 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and none of the 28 patients not treated with the drug had vitamin B(12) plasma levels lower than 197 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> plasma levles and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment time or dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is associated to lower <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> plasma levels </plain></SENT>
