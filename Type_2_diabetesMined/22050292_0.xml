<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, how early these alterations may occur has never been fully clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed at investigating cardiac functional abnormalities in uncomplicated hypertensive or normotensive patients with a recent diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 40 diabetics (24 normotensives and 16 hypertensives) by means of routine echocardiography plus pulse tissue Doppler analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were compared with those obtained in healthy age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular remodelling was more evident in hypertensive diabetics than in normotensive diabetics vs controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diastolic function was altered in diabetic patients only when detected by pulse tissue Doppler analysis and not by conventional transmitral Doppler evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with little or no evidence at standard echocardiography of alterations in cardiac structure and function, already displayed an alteration in diastolic function when the evaluation was based on the tissue Doppler approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> combined to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> showed more evident functional cardiac alterations at echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the conclusion that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> are very early phenomena in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
