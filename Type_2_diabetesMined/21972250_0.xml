<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Discussions are underway about diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on the basis of HbA1C titres and using HbA1C tests to screen for T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These discussions have focused on the relative benefits for individual patients, with some attention directed towards reduced costs to healthcare systems and benefits to society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We argue that there are strong ethical reasons for adopting HbA1C-based diagnosis and T2DM screening that have not yet been articulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rationale includes the differential impact of HbA1C-based diabetic testing on disadvantaged groups, and what we are beginning to learn about HbA1C vis-Ã -vis population health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although it is arguable that screening must primarily benefit the individual, using HbA1C to diagnose and screen for T2DM may promote a more just distribution of health resources and lead to advances in investigating, monitoring and tackling the social determinants of health </plain></SENT>
