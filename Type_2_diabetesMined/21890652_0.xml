<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess whether family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or the HLA-DR-DQ genotype of the index case was associated with the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e>) at diagnosis of childhood type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised 1518 children aged &lt;15 years and diagnosed with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Finland in 2002-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Family history of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among first-degree relatives (FDRs) and grandparents was assessed at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR-DQ genotypes were analysed using time-resolved fluorometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 12.6 and 1.7% of children had at least one FDR affected with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively, and 6.6 and 34.8% had at least one grandparent with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> (pH &lt;7.30) occurred less frequently in children having a type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> affected FDR (7.4 vs 20.5%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among the parents or grandparents had no such effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower risk HLA genotypes were observed to predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> (P&lt;0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression analysis, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> was independently associated with the absence of a family member affected by type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the presence of a low-risk HLA genotype and older age at diagnosis (odds ratio 3.23, 1.45 and 1.07 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an FDR is associated with an decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> seems to be higher in children with lower HLA-conferred risk for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
