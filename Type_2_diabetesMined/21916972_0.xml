<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, more detailed information on effects of alcohol types and early phases of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development seems warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of alcohol consumption and specific alcoholic beverages on the risk of developing pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged Swedish men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects, who at baseline had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (2070 men and 3058 women) or pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (70 men and 41 women), aged 35-56 years, were evaluated in this cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was performed to estimate the risk [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)] to develop pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 8-10 years follow-up, in relation to self-reported alcohol intake at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment was performed for several risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total alcohol consumption and binge drinking increased the risk of pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00-2.03 and OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.11-2.50, respectively), while low consumption decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in women (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men showed higher risk of pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with high beer consumption (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.13-3.01) and of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with high consumption of spirits (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.27-3.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women showed a reduced risk of pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with high wine intake (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43-0.99) and of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with medium intake of both wine and spirits (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.88 and OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.97, respectively), whereas high consumption of spirits increased the pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk(OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.47-3.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High alcohol consumption increases the risk of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In women the associations are more complex: decreased risk with low or medium intake and increased risk with high alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
