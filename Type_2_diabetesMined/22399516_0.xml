<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationships of circulating Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) mass and activity with incident type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> have not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the association of Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) mass and activity with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted analyses of Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) and prevalent and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among 5474 men and women from the Cardiovascular Health Study (1989-2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) mass and activity were measured in baseline plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status was ascertained annually with medication inventories and repeated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Generalized linear and Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for confounding factors including body mass index and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the top two quintiles of Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity were significantly associated with prevalent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a multivariable relative risk = 1.35 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-1.63] for quintile 4, and relative risk = 1.33 (95% CI = 1.07-1.66) for quintile 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among participants free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, we found a significant positive association with both the homeostatic model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and Î²-cell function per SD increase in Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity (P values for both &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In prospective analyses, the risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher among those in the highest quintile of Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity [multivariable hazard ratio = 1.45 (95% CI = 1.01-2.07)] compared with the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) mass was not significantly associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity is positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and predicts incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among older adults independent of multiple factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
