<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of Tinospora crispa on serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Serum from 10 healthy subjects and 10 diabetic participants, who had fasted overnight, were obtained every 30-60 minutes during the 3 hours of continued fasting and during the 3 hours after ingestion of 75 g of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with or without ingestion of 125 or 250 g of Tinospora crispa dry powder capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and Insulin levels were analyzed and the areas under the curve for mean serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The areas under the curve of mean serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels in both healthy and diabetic participants were not significantly different between with or without Tinospora crispa dry powder capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In diabetic participants the area under the curve of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was slightly lesser when 250 mg of Tinospora crispa was ingested, but not reaching statistical significance (478 and 444 mg min/ml, resp., P = 0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Tinospora crispa ingestion cannot affect serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels in healthy subjects or patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
