<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a sample of adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, attending health centers in Venezuela </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, current medications, complications, and diet were obtained by trained interviewers, using a standardized questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in a central laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with HbA(1c) &gt;or=7% were considered to have inadequate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall 4075 patients were surveyed, 349(8.6%) with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1D) and 3726(91.4%) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>(T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects' mean age was 58 years, and 65% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of inadequate glycemic control was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor glycemic control was more common in T1D patients (87%) than in those with T2D(75%), p&lt;10(-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction with current <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment was associated with improved glycemic control among non-insulin-treated patients with T2D, but gender, multi-professional care, and participation in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education program were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite clinical evidence supporting tight control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, few diabetic patients in Venezuela met recommended glycemic control targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to increased rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the public health message of implementation of early, aggressive management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
