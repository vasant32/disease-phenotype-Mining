<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects sought the confirmation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis or underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening tests in high-risk patients from January 2008 to October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them underwent 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin releasing test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of GA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) were analyzed by liquid enzymatic method and high performance liquid chromatography respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to evaluate the basal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and pancreatic β cell function (HOMA-β). ΔI30/ΔG30 was used to evaluate early-phase insulin secretion after a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Among 500 type 2 diabetics according to the diagnostic criteria of WHO (1999), 279 were males and 221 were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average age was 56.3 ± 12.3, GA (21.1 ± 5.4)% and HbA1c (7.0 ± 1.3)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) A significantly positive relationship was shown between HbA1c and GA (r = 0.691, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GA was also positively correlated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), 0.5 hPG, 1 hPG, 2 hPG and 3 hPG after a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load of OGTT test (r = 0.511 - 0.627, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) GA was negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.112, P &lt; 0.01), HOMA-β (r = -0.350, P &lt; 0.01) and ΔI30/ΔG30 (r = -0.263, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(4) Multivariant stepwise regression analysis showed that HbA1c, FPG, 3 hPG and ΔI30/ΔG30 were independent factors of GA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Glycated albumin level is closely correlated with the function of early-phase insulin secretion in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
