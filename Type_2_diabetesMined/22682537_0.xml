<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and thigh and calf circumference in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 4,427 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed according the rate constant for plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance (Kitt) determined via the short insulin tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and anthropometric profiles were measured according to a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visceral fat thickness and carotid intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) were measured by ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity index (Kitt) was significantly correlated with weight adjusted thigh and calf circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thigh circumference was inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in men and women and calf circumference was negatively correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that thigh circumference was independently correlated with insulin sensitivity index (Kitt) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in multivariate logistic regression analysis, thigh circumference was an independent determinant factor for carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> even after adjusting for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thigh and calf circumference were correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and thigh circumference was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
