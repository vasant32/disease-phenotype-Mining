<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine how family/friend social support, exercise self-efficacy, physical environment, sense of community, social issues and roles, socioeconomic status, and body image discrepancy influence physical activity levels in African American females with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: A sample of 50 African American females with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was recruited from a Midwest <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> center for this descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A series of self-report instruments were administered to examine the relationships between the independent study variables and physical activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study suggested that higher levels of exercise self-efficacy, family social support for exercise, and a decrease in physical environmental barriers may serve to increase physical activity levels in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant relationships were observed between the other study variables and physical activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurse practitioners working with African American females with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> need to assess family social support, exercise self-efficacy, and physical environmental barriers and plan interventions that incorporate family support and the principles of self-efficacy while minimizing environmental barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further exploration is warranted to examine the relationship between body image discrepancy and physical activity in this population </plain></SENT>
