<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50735">carbamoylbenzoic acid</z:chebi> derivative, is chemically related to the meglitinide class of insulin secretagogues, but unrelated to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> insulin secretagogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Meglitinides, including repaglinide, have a distinct binding site at the β-cell membrane, which differs from that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, and corresponds to greater insulinotropic effects with repaglinide than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and a more rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action in in vitro and in vivo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of oral repaglinide in the treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and provides an overview of its pharmacological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In well designed clinical trials of up to 52 weeks' duration and in the clinical practice setting, recommended dosages of repaglinide (0.5-4 mg three times daily up to 30 minutes prior to a meal) provided effective glycaemic control and were generally well tolerated in treatment-naive or -experienced adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including elderly patients and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, repaglinide was at least as effective as other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs at improving or maintaining glycaemic control, with a tolerability profile that was generally similar to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> drugs and nateglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, repaglinide remains an effective option for the management of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
