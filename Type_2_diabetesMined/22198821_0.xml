<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggest that aloe (Aloe vera L.) leaf gel may positively affect the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels in dyslipidemic type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with hyperlipidemic (hypercholesterolemic and/or hypertriglyceridemic) type 2 diabetic patients aged 40 to 60 years not using other anti-hyperlipidemic agents and resistant to daily intake of two 5 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> tablets and two 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> tablets, the efficacy and safety of taking aloe gel (one 300 mg capsule every 12 hours for 2 months) combined with the aforementioned drugs in treatment of 30 patients were evaluated and compared with the placebo group (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aloe gel lowered the fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels significantly (p = 0.036, p = 0.036, p = 0.006, and p = 0.004, respectively) without any significant effects on the other blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and liver/kidney function tests (p &gt; 0.05) compared with the placebo at the endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that aloe gel may be a safe anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypercholesterolemic agent for hyperlipidemic type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
