<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: English-language articles in the PubMed database to October 2011 (selected using the search terms linagliptin, alogliptin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) were identified for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reference lists from identified articles were reviewed for additional references of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abstracts published at relevant meetings were also evaluated, and information was obtained from the manufacturer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Publications reporting the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy and safety of linagliptin were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: Linagliptin therapy results in clinically meaningful reductions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), as well as fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oral doses of linagliptin 5 mg once daily have been shown to be clinically effective, well tolerated, and weight-neutral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> when linagliptin was used in combination with an insulin secretagogue compared to placebo was noted in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Linagliptin provides an additional therapeutic option for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and, in contrast to other agents in the DPP-4 class, can be used without dose adjustment in patients with any degree of declining renal function </plain></SENT>
