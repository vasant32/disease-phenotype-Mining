<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To verify the effect of kaki-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="26848">tannin</z:chebi> on the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, type 2 diabetic NSY/Hos mice were fed an AIN76-modified high fat diet supplemented with 1% (w/w) kaki-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="26848">tannin</z:chebi> for 8weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kaki-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="26848">tannin</z:chebi> induced a 2-fold increase in fecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> excretion and was significantly effective in the prevention of a rise in plasma cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaki-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="26848">tannin</z:chebi> treatment also prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify the molecular mechanism underlying these effects, gene expression analysis was performed on liver, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genes related to cholesterol metabolism, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> reductase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element-binding protein 2, were increased in the liver of the kaki-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="26848">tannin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) gene and the UCP3 gene were significantly increased in the BAT of the kaki-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="26848">tannin</z:chebi> group, which was also confirmed at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that induction of UCP1 and UCP3 in the BAT by kaki-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="26848">tannin</z:chebi> treatment might influence the energy metabolism, thus contributing beneficial effects to type 2 diabetic NSY/Hos mice </plain></SENT>
