<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To estimate remaining life expectancy (RLE), quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and lifetime cumulative incidence of microvascular/macrovascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for youths diagnosed with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov-like computer model simulated the life course for a hypothetical cohort of adolescents/young adults in the USA, aged 15-24 years, newly diagnosed with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> following either conventional or intensive treatment based on the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included RLE, discounted QALE in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cumulative incidence of microvascular/macrovascular complications and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with a mean RLE of 58.6 years for a 20-year-old in the USA without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, conventional treatment produced an average RLE of 43.09 years and 22.44 discounted QALYs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensive treatment afforded an incremental 0.98 years and 0.44 discounted QALYs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intensive treatment led to lower lifetime cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> microvascular complications and lower mortality from microvascular complications (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 19.4% vs. 25.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 5% with both treatments had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> within 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lifetime cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) increased with longer RLE and greater severity of CHD risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incorporating disutility (loss in health-related quality of life) of intensive treatment resulted in net loss of QALYs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents/young adults with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> lose approximately 15 years from average RLE and may experience severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by their 40s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The net clinical benefit of intensive treatment may be sensitive to preferences for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive management plan that includes early and aggressive control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> is likely needed to reduce lifetime risk of CHD </plain></SENT>
