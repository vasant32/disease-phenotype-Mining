<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is present in 25 % of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, its risk being doubled in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine the effectiveness of the Study of Women's Emotions and Evaluation of a Psychoeducational (SWEEP), a group therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles that was developed for women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Women with significantly elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale ≥16) were randomized to SWEEP (n = 38) or usual care (UC, n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multilevel modeling indicated that SWEEP was more effective than UC in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (mean difference of -15 vs. -7, p &lt; .01), decreasing trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (mean difference of -15 vs. -5, p &lt; .01), and improving anger expression (mean difference of -12 vs. -5, p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although SWEEP and UC had improvements in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (mean difference of -24 vs. -1 mg/dl) and HbA1c (mean difference of -0.4 vs. -0.1 %), there were no statistically significant differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SWEEP was more effective than UC for treating depressed women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of group therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> meaningfully expands the armamentarium of evidence-based treatment options for women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
