<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of any and referable diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> attending an annual screening service for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and whose first screening episode indicated no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective four year analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Screenings at the community based Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Screening Service for Wales, United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 57,199 people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, who were diagnosed at age 30 years or older and who had no evidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at their first screening event between 2005 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>49,763 (87%) had at least one further screening event within the study period and were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual incidence and cumulative incidence after four years of any and referable diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relations between available putative risk factors and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of any and referable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at four years was 360.27 and 11.64 per 1000 people, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the first to fourth year, the annual incidence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> fell from 124.94 to 66.59 per 1000 people, compared with referable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, which increased slightly from 2.02 to 3.54 per 1000 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of referable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was independently associated with known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age at diagnosis, and use of insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For participants needing insulin treatment with a duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 10 years or more, cumulative incidence of referable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at one and four years was 9.61 and 30.99 per 1000 people, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis supports the extension of the screening interval for people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> beyond the currently recommended 12 months, with the possible exception of those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 10 years or more and on insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
