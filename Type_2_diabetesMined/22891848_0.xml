<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure (BP) targets have been progressively lowered in these patients to prevent or delay the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no long-term population-based studies have been reported on the interaction between BP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> with respect to total and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We prospectively followed 881 middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients, free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events at baseline, for up to 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were categorized into four groups according to baseline systolic BP (&lt;130, 130-139, 140-159 and ≥160 mmHg) and further stratified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (≤150 or &gt;150 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the joint association between systolic BP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and the risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 607 patients died including 395 due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounding factors, total and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality were significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and systolic BP &lt;130 mmHg compared to those with systolic BP between 130 and 160 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was similar in patients with systolic BP &lt;130 mmHg or ≥160 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, systolic BP &lt;130 mmHg was associated with a non-significant reduction in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and with systolic BP &lt;130 mmHg may have an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> should be taken into account when defining the target systolic BP level for the prevention of fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>. © 2012 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine </plain></SENT>
