<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since avoidance of sedentary behavior appears to have a large impact on glycemic management, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be encouraged to minimally engage in greater daily movement to better manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, engaging in physical activity of any intensity (including low-intensity ones) likely positively impacts insulin action and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control acutely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as long as total caloric expenditure during exercise is matched (i.e., total exercise dose), daily exercise may be done every other day instead with the same glycemic results, although at least 150 min of weekly physical activity is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both aerobic and resistance training are important for individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and ideally a program that combines the two types of training should be undertaken to achieve maximal glycemic and other benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once individuals have successfully implemented more daily movement into their lifestyle, they will be more likely to participate in structured forms of physical activity to gain additional benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinicians working with individuals with either type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> should consider incorporating these suggestions into care plans to improve their patients' glycemic management </plain></SENT>
