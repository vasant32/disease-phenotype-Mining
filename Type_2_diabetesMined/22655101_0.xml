<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed and compared the strength of the association and discriminatory capability of systolic (SBP), diastolic (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) BP, pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> risk in sub-Saharan Africans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were 420 consecutive individuals (49% men) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> care in two main referral centres in the two major cities of Cameroon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to compute the odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for a standard deviation (SD) higher level of SBP (25 mmHg), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (13), PP (18) and MAP (16) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discrimination was assessed and compared with c-statistics and relative integrated discrimination improvement (RIDI, %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted OR (95% CI) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> with each SD higher BP variable were: 1.45 (1.15-1.84) for SBP, 1.33 (1.06-1.66) for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, 1.35 (1.06-1.71) for PP and 1.42 (1.13-1.78) for MAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C-statistic comparison showed no difference in discrimination of models with each of the BP variables (p-values â‰¥ 0.69 for c-statistics comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, RIDI statistic always showed and enhancement in models discrimination when other BP variables were replaced with SBP, although such an enhancement was marginal for MAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using BP combination modestly improved models? discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SBP was the best predictor of prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in this population, while <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> was the less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may have implication for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> risk stratification and protection </plain></SENT>
