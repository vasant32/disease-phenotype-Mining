<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy addressing the core defects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> shows promise in maintaining glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of alogliptin combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The study consisted of 26-wk treatment with alogliptin (12.5 or 25 mg qd) alone or combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (15, 30, or 45 mg qd) in 1554 patients on stable-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (≥1500 mg) with inadequate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary endpoint was change in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) from baseline to wk 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included changes in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary analyses compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy [<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses pooled, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> alone (Pio alone); n = 387] with alogliptin 12.5 mg plus any dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (A12.5+P; n = 390) or alogliptin 25 mg plus any dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (A25+P; n = 390) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, the least squares mean change (LSMΔ) from baseline HbA(1c) was -0.9 ± 0.05% in the Pio-alone group and -1.4 ± 0.05% in both the A12.5+P and A25+P groups (P &lt; 0.001 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A12.5+P and A25+P produced greater reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (LSMΔ = -2.5 ± 0.1 mmol/liter for both) than Pio alone (LSMΔ = -1.6 ± 0.1 mmol/liter; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A12.5+P and A25+P significantly improved measures of β-cell function (proinsulin:insulin and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function) compared to Pio alone, but had no effect on homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The LSMΔ body weight was 1.8 ± 0.2, 1.9 ± 0.2, and 1.5 ± 0.2 kg in A12.5+P, A25+P, and Pio-alone groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was reported by 1.0, 1.5, and 2.1% of patients in the A12.5+P, A25+P, and Pio-alone groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, the reduction in HbA(1c) by alogliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The decreases in HbA(1c) with A12.5+P and A25+P were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
