<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although the Western diet and lifestyle has contributed to an increase in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) worldwide, genetic predisposition also plays an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the genetic interface between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of the current literature on genetics of T2D and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young</z:hpo> (MODY) due to glucokinase mutations may account for as much as 5% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of both maternal and fetal genotypes may be useful for individualizing glycemic goals during pregnancy in families harboring these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 common T2D susceptibility variants identified to date, several are also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presumably, these mutations increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk through decreased ability of Î²-cells to compensate for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> associated with pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of these alleles on risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> is modest (odds ratios (odds ratio (OR)~1.1-1.6); thus, they individually are poorly predictive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Future studies must concentrate on understanding the biological underpinnings of known T2D risk alleles and the discovery of new alleles for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These insights may lead to more effective strategies for preventing and treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
