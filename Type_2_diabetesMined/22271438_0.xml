<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to verify whether such a relationship applies also to type 2 DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The respiratory muscle function was explored in 75 non-smoking patients with type 2 DM without pulmonary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> and compared with that of 40 healthy non-smoking control subjects matched by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), which reflect respiratory muscle strength and endurance, respectively, were measured, and a complete respiratory function assessment was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were in stable metabolic conditions and had, on average, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> total lung capacity and diffusing lung capacity for <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, MIP and MVV were significantly reduced in comparison with those of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both MIP/<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and MVV significantly correlated with lung volumes and diffusing lung capacity for <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multiple regression analysis identified age (beta coefficient = -0.238, p = 0.046), glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (beta coefficient = -0.245, p = 0.047) and total lung capacity (beta coefficient = 0.430, p = 0.016) as independent correlates of MIP, whereas male sex (beta coefficient = 0.423, p = 0.004) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> (beta coefficient = -0.248, p = 0.044) were independent correlates of MVV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 DM, respiratory muscle strength was reduced and significantly related to lung volumes and quality of metabolic control, whereas impaired endurance of respiratory muscles prevailed in patients with microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
