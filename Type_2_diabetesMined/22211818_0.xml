<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> represent one group at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and subsequent mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to examine the relationship between C-reactive protein concentrations and risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in European Americans with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 846 European Americans with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and baseline measures of C-reactive protein were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vital status was determined after a follow-up period of 7.3 ± 2.1 years (mean ± SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein concentrations were compared between living and deceased subgroups along with other known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, including blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was performed to determine risk for mortality associated with increasing C-reactive protein concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up 160 individuals (18.7%) were deceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in baseline serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> measures were observed between living and deceased subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline C-reactive protein concentrations were significantly higher in the deceased subgroup (9.37 ± 15.94) compared with the living subgroup (5.36 ± 7.91 mg/l; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants with C-reactive protein concentrations of 3-10 mg/l were approximately two times more likely to be deceased at follow-up (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.17-3.62); those with C-reactive protein &gt;10 mg/l were more than five times more likely to be deceased (OR 5.24; CI 2.80-9.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the utility of C-reactive protein in predicting risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in European Americans with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and supports its use as a screening tool in risk prediction models </plain></SENT>
