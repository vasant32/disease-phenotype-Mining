<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is common in middle aged and old people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we present a technique to analyze dynamic foot pressures images and classify them into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type 2 with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plantar pressure images were obtained using the F-Scan (Tekscan, USA) in-shoe measurement system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Principal Component Analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and extracted the eigenvalues from different regions of the foot image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The features extracted from region 1 of the foot pressure image, which were found to be clinically significant, were fed into the Fuzzy classifier (Sugeno model) for automatic classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the proposed method is able to identify the unknown class with an accuracy of 93.7%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 83.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in this work, we have proposed an integrated index using the eigenvalues to differentiate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> subjects using just one number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This index will help the clinicians in easy and objective daily screening, and it can also be used as an adjunct tool to cross check their diagnosis </plain></SENT>
