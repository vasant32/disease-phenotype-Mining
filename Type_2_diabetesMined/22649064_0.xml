<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cytokine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-inhibitory factor (LIF) is expressed by skeletal muscle and induces proliferation of muscle precursor cells, an important feature of skeletal muscle maintenance and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that muscle precursor cells from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a deficient response to LIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of LIF and its receptor (LIFR) were measured in skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy individuals and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by use of qPCR and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LIF signaling and response were studied following administration of recombinant LIF and siRNA knockdown of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3 in myoblast cultures established from healthy individuals and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myoblast proliferation rate was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LIF and LIFR proteins were increased in both muscle tissue and cultured myoblasts from diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, in the diabetic myoblasts, LIF-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT3 was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deficient response to LIF administration in the diabetic myoblasts was further emphasized by a lack of increase in LIF-stimulated cell proliferation and a decreased LIF-stimulated induction of the proliferation-promoting factors cyclin D1, JunB, and c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SOCS3 protein was upregulated in diabetic myoblasts, and knockdown of SOCS3 rescued LIF-induced gene expression in diabetic myoblasts, whereas neither STAT1 or STAT3 signaling nor proliferation rate was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although LIF and LIFR proteins were increased in muscle tissue and myoblasts from diabetic patients, LIF signaling and LIF-stimulated cell proliferation were impaired in diabetic myoblasts, suggesting a novel mechanism by which muscle function is compromised in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
