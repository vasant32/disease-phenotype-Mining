<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the impact of the coadministration of TZD and ACEI/ARB on hematocrit and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values in uncomplicated patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>.Data from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> currently followed, were reviewed and patients treated with ACEI/ARB and/or TZD were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of this study the following 4 groups of 30 stable non-anemic diabetic patients each matched for age, gender, and BMI were formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group ACEI/ARB included patients on ACEI/ARB without TZD, group TZD included patients on TZD and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> other than ACEI/ARB, group ACEI/ARB/TZD consisted of patients on combined therapy with ACEI/ARB and TZD and the control group C included patients never exposed to ACEI/ARB or TZD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory data were collected prior to initiation of treatment and after 6 months.Neither hematocrit nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> showed any significant change from baseline at the end of the study in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both group ACEI/ARB and group TZD a small, but statistically significant reduction in hematocrit (~ 1% point) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (~ 0.3 g/dl) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A greater statistically and clinically important reduction in hematocrit (~ 3% points) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (~ 1 g/dl) levels was observed in group ACEI/ARB/TZD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> at the end reached 7% in group TZD and 23% in group ACEI/ARB/TZD.Coadministration of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> inhibitors and PPAR-Î³ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hematocrit lowering and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in uncomplicated type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism(s), the cardiovascular consequences and the cost utility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> workup in such patients </plain></SENT>
