<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the role of insulin on the association of the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT1) to myosin phosphatase Rho-interacting protein (MRIP), a relatively novel member of the myosin phosphatase complex that directly binds RhoA in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through a series of molecular and cellular studies, we investigated whether insulin stimulates the binding of MRIP to MYPT1 and compared the results generated from VSMCs isolated from both Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control and Goto-Kakizaki (GK) diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate for the first time that insulin stimulates the binding of MRIP to MYPT1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as determined by immunoprecipitation, implying a regulatory role for MRIP in insulin-induced vasodilation signaling via MYPT1 interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VSMCs from GK model of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had impaired insulin-induced MRIP/MYPT1 binding as well as reduced MRIP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MRIP in GK VSMCs led to significantly improved insulin-stimulated MRIP/MYPT1 binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, insulin-stimulated MRIP translocation out of stress fibers, which was observed in control VSMCs, was impaired in GK VSMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe the impaired expression of MRIP, and therefore decreased insulin-stimulated MRIP/MYPT1 association, in the GK diabetic model may contribute to the impaired insulin-mediated vasodilation observed in the diabetic vasculature and provides a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
