<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is approximately 2-fold higher in African Americans than in European Americans even after adjusting for known environmental risk factors, including socioeconomic status (SES), suggesting that genetic factors may explain some of this population difference in disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, relatively few genetic studies have examined this hypothesis in a large sample of African Americans with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed an admixture analysis using 2,189 ancestry-informative markers in 7,021 African Americans (2,373 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 4,648 without) from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study, the Jackson Heart Study, and the Multiethnic Cohort to 1) determine the association of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its related quantitative traits with African ancestry controlling for measures of SES and 2) identify genetic loci for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through a genome-wide admixture mapping scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median percentage of African ancestry of diabetic participants was slightly greater than that of non-diabetic participants (study-adjusted difference = 1.6%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> comparing participants in the highest vs. lowest tertile of African ancestry was 1.33 (95% confidence interval 1.13-1.55), after adjustment for age, sex, study, body mass index (BMI), and SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Admixture scans identified two potential loci for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 12p13.31 (LOD = 4.0) and 13q14.3 (Z score = 4.5, P = 6.6 �� 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, genetic ancestry has a significant association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> above and beyond its association with non-genetic risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African Americans, but no single gene with a major effect is sufficient to explain a large portion of the observed population difference in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There undoubtedly is a complex interplay among specific genetic loci and non-genetic factors, which may both be associated with overall admixture, leading to the observed ethnic differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
