<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of education has been found to be efficacious in the short term, but tends to lose efficacy in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis tested here was that one-to-one education would confer knowledge that would be reflected in metabolic improvement in this group of participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and poor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control attended a one-to-one diabetic and dietetic education session with a diabetic specialist nurse and a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specialist dieticican </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was assessed by measuring serum glycosolated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb(A1c)) measurements before the session and at 6 and 12 months afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Hb(A1c) levels fell significantly in the whole group to 8.0 ± 0.5% (P &lt; 0.05) at 6 months and to 8.3 ± 0.7% (P &lt; 0.05) at the final visit from a baseline of 9.2 ± 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to female patients, male patients had a similar drop in Hb(A1c) at 6 months of 1.1%, which persisted until the final visit, when the drop was -1.3% vs 0.3% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single episode of one-to-one diabetic and dietetic education to subjects with poor diabetic control is effective in improving short- and long-term diabetic control for up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Male patients were found to have a better response than female patients </plain></SENT>
