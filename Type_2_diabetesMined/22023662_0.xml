<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between lifetime severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and late-life cognitive ability in older people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional, population-based study of 1066 men and women aged 60-75 years, with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequency of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> over a person's lifetime and in the year prior to cognitive testing was assessed using a previously validated self-completion questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of age-sensitive neuropsychological tests were combined to derive a late-life general cognitive ability factor, 'g' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vocabulary test scores, which are stable during ageing, were used to estimate early life (prior) cognitive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After age- and sex- adjustment, 'g' was lower in subjects reporting at least one prior severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> episode (n = 113), compared with those who did not report severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (mean 'g'-0.34 vs. 0.05, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean vocabulary test scores did not differ significantly between the two groups (30.2 vs. 31.0, P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for vocabulary, difference in 'g' between the groups persisted (means -0.25 vs. 0.04, P &lt; 0.001), with the group with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> demonstrating poorer performance on tests of Verbal Fluency (34.5 vs. 37.3, P = 0.02), Digit Symbol Testing (45.9 vs. 49.9, P = 0.002), Letter-Number Sequencing (9.1 vs. 9.8, P = 0.005) and Trail Making (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations persisted after adjustment for duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and other potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported history of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was associated with poorer late-life cognitive ability in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Persistence of this association after adjustment for estimated prior cognitive ability suggests that the association may be attributable, at least in part, to an effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> on age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
