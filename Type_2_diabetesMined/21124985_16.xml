<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent multi-dimensional approaches to the study of complex disease have revealed powerful insights into how genetic and epigenetic factors may underlie their aetiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined genotype-epigenotype interactions in the context of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (T2D), focussing on known regions of genomic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assayed DNA methylation in 60 females, stratified according to disease susceptibility haplotype using previously identified association loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CpG methylation was assessed using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on a targeted array (MeDIP-chip) and absolute methylation values were estimated using a Bayesian algorithm (BATMAN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absolute methylation levels were quantified across LD blocks, and we identified increased DNA methylation on the FTO <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> susceptibility haplotype, tagged by the rs8050136 risk allele A (p = 9.40×10(-4), permutation p = 1.0×10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis across the 46 kb LD block using sliding windows localised the most significant difference to be within a 7.7 kb region (p = 1.13×10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence level analysis, followed by pyrosequencing validation, revealed that the methylation difference was driven by the co-ordinated phase of CpG-creating SNPs across the risk haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This 7.7 kb region of haplotype-specific methylation (HSM), encapsulates a Highly Conserved Non-Coding Element (HCNE) that has previously been validated as a long-range enhancer, supported by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K4me1 enhancer signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that integration of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) SNP and epigenomic DNA methylation data can identify potential novel genotype-epigenotype interactions within disease-associated loci, thus providing a novel route to aid unravelling common complex diseases </plain></SENT>
