<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the life expectancy and mortality rates in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> when compared with the UK general population; to measure the years of life lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal and retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Wirral Peninsula in the northwest of England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Total of 13 620 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on the Wirral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality, from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the 8-year period of the study, there were a total of 16 692.5 person-years lived and 3888 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; 2041 (52.5%) males and 1847 (47.5%) females with corresponding mean ages at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 75.6±10.3 years and 80.2±10.2 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although prevalence rates increased linearly (from 1.06% in 2000 to 4.39% in 2007) a decrease in mortality rates (from 117 to 46 per 1000 population) in both sexes was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This coincided with a progressive fall in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A survival time curve of life lived until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> showed that males had 8.0 years reduction in life span and females' life span was reduced by 9.6 years when compared with UK general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both sexes, life expectancy was reduced by between 2 and 11 years dependent on the age of diagnosis, with males showing a greater degree of reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is associated with a significant reduction in life expectancy, more markedly in men, and in those diagnosed before age 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, annual mortality rates have fallen progressively in our population and may contribute to longer survival and life expectancy in future years </plain></SENT>
