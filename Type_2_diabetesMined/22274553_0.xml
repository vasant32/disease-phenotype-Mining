<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the interrelationship between BID and anthropometric, laboratory and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 681 type 2 diabetic patients, treated with bedtime insulin in association with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (preprandial insulin and/or oral agents), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters, as well as micro- and macrovascular complications, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) was assessed by liver ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BID was titrated to achieve a fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> target of ≤6.7 mmol/L (120 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, BID was significantly associated with waist circumference (p = 0.04) and the insulin treatment duration (p = 0.004) as the type of insulin treatment ("basal-bolus" regimen vs. basal insulin only, p &lt; 0.0001), the use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs (p = 0.0003) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin sensitizers</z:chebi> (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several glycometabolic parameters were strongly associated with BID (HbA1c p = 0.01, FPG p &lt; 0.0001, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> p = 0.02, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the presence of severe NAFLD resulted in a higher BID (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that when starting and titrating the basal insulin in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, certain anthropometric, laboratory and clinical factors can be useful to find optimal BID more quickly and appropriately </plain></SENT>
