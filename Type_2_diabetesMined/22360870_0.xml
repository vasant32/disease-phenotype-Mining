<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>29, 1268-1271 (2012) ABSTRACT: Objective  To assess the number and sex ratio of children in individuals with Type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and the influence of parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods  In a cross-sectional study in a German region comprising 350 000 inhabitants, 697 subjects with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (364 women, 333 men) underwent a standardized assessment regarding the number and sex of their children and the family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results  Compared with 1.36 children per woman in the German background population, the total fertility rate in the calendar year of 2010 in our female cohort with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age 18-49 years) was 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Men with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a fertility rate of 0.65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More men (51.1%) than women (35.7%; P &lt; 0.0001) were childless </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women aged 41-45 years in the background population were childless compared with 36.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women and 52% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men in this specific age group from our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sex ratio of female vs. male offspring of individuals with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not differ significantly from the expected 1:1 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maternal Type 1 or Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 22.9 ± 13.7 (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo>) to 28.6 ± 16.8 and 30.1 ± 15.1 years (p &lt; 0.0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions  Compared with the German reference population, individuals with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly fewer children and were more often childless </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sex ratio female vs. male offspring of women and men with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Maternal history of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with a significant later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
