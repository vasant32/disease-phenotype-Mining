<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparing psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment responses could help to inform the choice between available treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty-four patients with T2DM and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> detected by using the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (HADS), the Montgomery-Äsberg <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Rating Scale (MADRS) and a structured interview (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) were randomized to undergo Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) or treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> in a 3-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intervention course in addition to a 3-month continuation format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Provided that the initial MADRS score was not reduced ≥25% at week 6, these early non-responding patients continued treatment in a sequential add-on combined format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Psychological adjustment to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, attachment style, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-efficacy, quality of life and HbA1c were also evaluated along intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 22 early-responding patients (11 for each treatment type), 16 had clinically significant improvements (&lt;50% initial MADRS score) at endpoint with 11 reaching remission (MADRS scores ≤8), and with no significant differences between IPT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within sequential add-on treatment, out of eight patients, only three of them achieved a clinically significant improvement and only one reached remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggested that IPT may be an option to treat major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in T2DM against medical care with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early non-responding patients likely need alternative or longer treatment interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limitations of this study relate to small sample and absence of a control group, which was difficult to implement due to ethical restrictions </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Findings suggest that Interpersonal Psychotherapy is a useful tool to treat major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A significant number of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> do not achieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> remission irrespective of the type of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further clinical research should focus on addictive effects of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology in the treatment of depressed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> somatic diseases </plain></SENT>
