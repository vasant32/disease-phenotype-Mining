<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was a double-blinded, randomized, paralleled multicenter trial to compare the effects of sarpogrelate and aspirin on preventing macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were randomly assigned to either the sarpogrelateor the aspirin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline parameters for macrovascular complications, such as intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), ankle-brachial index (ABI), IL-6, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, adiponectin, and hsCRP, were measured before drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes were compared at 6 and 12 months after the administration of each drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 127 subjects (63 in the sarpogrelate group and 64 in the aspirin group) were pooled during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> or in other predictors of macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> increased in both groups after 12 months, but there was no significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant change was found in the other predictors of macrovascular complications nor in the incidence of drug-related adverse events between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the study period, no significant differences were found between the sarpogrelate group and aspirin group in the clinical indices or in the safety of the subjects related to macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that sarpogrelate may be clinically useful for the primary prevention of macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
