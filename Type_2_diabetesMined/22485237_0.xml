<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To find the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> in diabetic patients, and to study the relationship between the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> and state of control, and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This case control study was carried out in the Department of Medicine, Al-Yarmook Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq from April 2008 to December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 100 patients with type 2 DM (60 females and 40 males) as a test group and 100 subjects with no DM (61 females and 39 males) as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups were comparable for gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) and examined by ultrasound to find the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken for fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the BMI was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups were asked regarding age, gender, family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo>, and parity for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tested groups were further divided into 2 subgroups: with <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between duration of DM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c level with <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>Gallstones</z:hpo> were found in 33% of diabetic and 17% of non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in age and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> between diabetic and non-diabetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> was higher in diabetic patients with BMI &gt;25Kg/m2, with increased duration of DM, with increased HbA1C, and multiparous females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> in type 2 DM increases in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, females with increased parity, increased level of HbA1c, and is positively correlated with the duration of DM </plain></SENT>
