<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion is an important component of the glycaemic burden, but there are no indexes that can directly reflect them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to evaluate the values and significance of serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) in people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in China and to elucidate the relationship between 1,5-AG and traditional indexes of glycaemic excursions by continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 576 healthy adults and 292 patients were included, and their 1,5-AG, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the 34 patients, their mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, standard deviation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, mean amplitude of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion, mean of daily differences, low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> M-value index and the area under the curve for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> above 180 mg/dL were calculated by use of a continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of 1,5-AG among healthy adults were 28.44 ± 8.76 µg/mL with a significant gender bias rather than age bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1,5-AG levels in people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were 4.57 ± 3.71 µg/mL, which were lower than those seen in the healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between 1,5-AG and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r = -0.251, -0.195 and -0.349, respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system demonstrated that 1,5-AG presents a negative correlation with mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, standard deviation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, mean amplitude of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion and mean of daily differences for 7 days and with the area under the curve for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> above 180 mg/dL on the third, fourth and seventh days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1,5-AG may serve as a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and 7-day hyperglycaemic excursions as well as being a useful adjunct to glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
