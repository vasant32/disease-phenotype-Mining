<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been established that cytokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have revealed that the polymorphism at the stromal-derived factor 1β (SDF-1β) 3'A regulates the expression of SDF-1 (CXCL12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to explore this polymorphism in parallel with SDF-1 serum levels in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this assessment, peripheral blood samples were collected from 200 type 2 diabetic patients and 200 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted, and a PCR-RFLP screening was applied to examine the SDF-1β 3'A polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also applied the ELISA technique to measure serum levels of SDF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that there were no significant correlations between SDF-1β 3'Α polymorphism in type 2 diabetic patients when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, our results showed that the serum levels of SDF-1 were significantly increased in the patients when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of this study, we concluded that SDF-1β 3'Α polymorphism does not play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but that elevated serum levels of SDF-1 may be important for the etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but are unrelated to the SDF-1β 3'Α polymorphism </plain></SENT>
