<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two substudies, one which compared type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients to both lean- and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> BMI-matched subjects and the other study which compared lean body-matched post-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and control subjects, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fasting blood sample was obtained and plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A muscle biopsy was obtained from deltoideus and vastus lateralis, and fiber-type <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content was determined by fluorescence immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity estimated by Quicki index was higher in lean compared to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also in control and post-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, a higher insulin sensitivity was observed compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">Ceramide</z:chebi> content was consistently higher in type I than in type II muscle fibers and higher in deltoideus than vastus lateralis across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences between groups were observed in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content in either of the two substudies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In human skeletal muscle, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content was higher in type I than in type II fibers in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, but overall <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> muscle fiber content was not different compared to controls </plain></SENT>
