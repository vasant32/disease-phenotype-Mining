<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but without obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> (OSA) participated in a placebo-controlled single-blind study during which multiple wakefulness and sleep latency test, Epworth score, driving performance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) levels were assessed at baseline, end of placebo and treatment phase at baseline and after 22 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean (±standard error of the mean) age, body mass index (kg m(2) ) and HbA1c [mmol mol(-1) (%)] of patients at baseline were 50 ± 4.9 years, 37.6 ± 1.1 and 65 ± 19 (8.06 ± 0.41), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared to placebo, exenatide treatment was associated with a decrease in both subjective and objective sleepiness, based on the Epworth score reduction and the sleep latency increase assessed by multiple objective sleepiness and sustained attention (OSLER) tests, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean sleep latency time (adjusted for change in HbA1c and weight) were 32.1 ± 1.7, 29.1 ± 1.7 and 37.7 ± 1.7, respectively (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modelling for covariates suggested that improvement in mean sleep latency time is predicted by changes in weight (P = 0.003), but not by changes in HbA1c (P = 0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epworth sleepiness score was reduced significantly (values for placebo versus exenatide: 11.3 ± 1.2 versus 5.7 ± 1.3; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant change was noted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score and driving performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exenatide is associated with a significant reduction in objective sleepiness in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without OSA, independent of HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings could form a basis for further studies to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of sleepiness in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
