<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine health care utilization and costs in an insured cohort of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN: Cohort study derived from administrative data from 2002 to 2008 from 7 Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Seven thousand eight hundred six individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: Cost (inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and others) and utilization (number of inpatient days, outpatient visits, specialist visits) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with presurgical costs, the ratio of hospital costs (excluding the initial surgery), among beneficiaries who had any hospital costs, was higher in years 2 through 6 of the postsurgery period and increased over time [post 1: odds ratio (OR)=0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.50-0.67; post 6: OR=3.43; 95% CI, 2.60-4.53] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the presurgical period, the odds of having any health care costs was lower in the postsurgery period and remained relatively flat over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those with hospitalizations, the adjusted ratio of inpatient days was higher after surgery (post 1: OR=1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.16; post 6: OR=2.77; 95% CI, 1.57-4.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those with primary care visits, the adjusted OR was lower after surgery (post 1: OR=0.80; 95% CI, 0.78-0.82; post 6: OR=0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : In the 6 years after surgery, individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not have lower health care costs than before surgery </plain></SENT>
