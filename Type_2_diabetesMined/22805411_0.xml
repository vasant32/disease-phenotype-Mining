<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted on 154 consecutive Kuwaiti adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who attended the diabetic out-patient clinic at Al-Sabah Hospital to determine the factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> was considered to be present if the urinary albumin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio test or 24-h collection was positive on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 102 (66.2%) women and 52 (33.8%) men, with a mean age of 49.1 Â± 10.1 years and a median duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was found in 60.8% of the patients and 16.3% had an HbA 1c &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> was found in 43.5% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and macroalbuminuria was 27.3% and 16.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, the factors that were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> - both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, HbA 1c , <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and modality of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that hyper-tension was the main independent risk factor associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1- 15.0; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> is common among Kuwaiti adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the prevalence is lower than that reported for other populations in spite of the poor glycemic control and the high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> appear to be similar to other populations, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was the most independent factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early recognition and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is an important strategy to prevent or delay DN as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A population-based study is warranted to confirm these findings and to search for genetic linkage for the development of DN </plain></SENT>
