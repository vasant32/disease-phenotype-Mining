<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicate that rarefaction may be reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment in nondiabetic hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the frequent association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, nothing is known on the capillary density of treated diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 21 normotensive healthy, 25 hypertensive only, and 21 diabetic (type 2) hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hypertensive patients were treated with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system, and a majority had a home blood pressure ≤135/85 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Capillary density was assessed with videomicroscopy on dorsal finger skin and with laser Doppler imaging on forearm skin (maximal vasodilation elicited by local heating) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference between any of the study groups in either dorsal finger skin capillary density (controls 101 ± 11 capillaries/mm(2) , nondiabetic hypertensive 99 ± 16, diabetic hypertensive 96 ± 18, p &gt; 0.5) or maximal blood flow in forearm skin (controls 666 ± 114 perfusion units, nondiabetic hypertensive 612 ± 126, diabetic hypertensive 620 ± 103, p &gt; 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of the presence or not of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, capillary density is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in hypertensive patients with reasonable control of blood pressure achieved with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system </plain></SENT>
