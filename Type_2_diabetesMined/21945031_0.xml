<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 79 consecutive type 2 diabetic outpatients and 46 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routine laboratory analysis, urinary albumin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (uACR), plasma adiponectin, plasma ICAM-1 and urinary MPC-1 were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multiple regression ICAM-1 (p=0.004) and adiponectin (p=0.04) were the main determinants of uACR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin positively correlated to ICAM-1 (p=0.03, r=0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In albuminuric patients (uACR â‰¥30 mg/g) plasma adiponectin was significantly higher compared to normoalbuminuric ones (uACR &lt;30 mg/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In albuminuric patients the main determinants of uACR were plasma ICAM-1 and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
