<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotypes were determined with qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 genotype frequencies for homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (C/C), heterozygous (C/T) and homozygous polymorphic (T/T) for T2DM patients were determined, respectively, as 71.4%, 14.3%, 14.3% and 72.5%, 11.8%, 15.7% for controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The weight, length and lean body mass were higher in C/T+T/T compared to C/C carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) were nonsignificantly higher in rs7903146C/T+T/T in comparison to C/C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 genotypes were not found to interact with drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absence of any difference between genotype frequencies among study groups indicates that no association persists with TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 polymorphism and T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effects of rs7903146 variation over some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> variables suggest that this variation may effect T2DM development via <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
