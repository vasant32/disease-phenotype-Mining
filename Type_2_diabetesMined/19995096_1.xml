<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Good glycaemic control in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> often requires insulin supplementation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent developments of analogue insulin and premixed formulations have increased the therapeutic options for patients who need such therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to retrospectively clarify appropriate treatment regimens according to age, body mass index (BMI) and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> previously entered in an open-label, randomized trial that compared convenience-oriented biphasic insulin aspart 30 versus multiple injections of insulin aspart with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Japanese insulin-na√Øve patients were randomized to receive either biphasic insulin aspart 30 twice daily or insulin aspart three times daily with or without multiple injections of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin for a treatment period lasting 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reduction of glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) at the end of 6 months was not different in the two treatment groups irrespective of BMI, age and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the achievement rate of HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% was significantly higher in patients with a BMI &lt;25 kg/m2 in the multiple-injection group and tended to be higher in patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration &lt;10 years in the twice-daily injection group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Twice-daily injections of biphasic insulin aspart 30 may be more suitable for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients whereas multiple injections of insulin aspart with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin may be preferable for those with a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
