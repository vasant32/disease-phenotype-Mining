<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The controlled clinical study in Japanese hypertensive patients indicates that once-daily azilsartan dose provides more potent 24-hour sustained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effect than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> but with equivalent safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Azilsartan was confirmed to improve more potently the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin-resistance</z:hpo> in SHR and type 2 diabetic mice and suppress more prominently the urinary albumin excretion in type 2 diabetic fatty rats than other ARBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, azilsartan is a unique <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agent</z:chebi> with the profile of more beneficial pharmacological activity, and could provide higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> control over 24-hour following once daily administration </plain></SENT>
