<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 6-month, open-label, observational study assessed the efficacy and safety of switching Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from neutral protamine Hagedorn (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) insulin to insulin detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 126) receiving basal-bolus insulin therapy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin plus rapid-acting insulin analogues were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin was replaced with insulin detemir for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal quality of life was assessed by insulin therapy related quality of life at night questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c), FPG and body weight were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly reduced after treatment with insulin detemir for 6 months, without increasing severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin dose increased significantly over the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant improvements in overall nocturnal quality of life, as well as well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with insulin detemir for 6 months resulted in substantial benefits, including reduced HbA(1c), FPG and body weight, and improvements in nocturnal quality of life, without increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
