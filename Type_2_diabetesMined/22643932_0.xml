<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that predispose to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> have recently been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is, however, not known whether such SNPs also confer susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped nine SNPs associated with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in genome-wide association studies in the Finnish population, and tested for their association with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as well as with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in 2,963 patients with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Replication of significant SNPs was sought in 2,980 patients from three other cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, rs10811661 near gene CDKN2A/B was associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association remained after robust Bonferroni correction for the total number of tests performed in this study (OR 1.33 [95% CI 1.14, 1.56], p = 0.00045, p (36tests) = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the meta-analysis, the combined result for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was significant, with a fixed effects p value of 0.011 (OR 1.15 [95% CI 1.02, 1.29]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association was particularly strong when patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> were compared with controls (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.13, 1.60], p = 0.00038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same SNP was also associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (OR 1.37 [95% CI 1.10, 1.69] p = 0.0040), but the association did not remain after Bonferroni correction (p (36tests) = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the other selected SNPs was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A SNP predisposing to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, rs10811661 near CDKN2A/B, is associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
