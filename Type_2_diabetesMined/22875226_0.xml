<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AAC progression was in general not significantly increased with more frequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use; in a subgroup of participants initially not receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, however, progression of both CAC and AAC was significantly increased in frequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> users.CONCLUSIONMore frequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use is associated with accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> in T2DM patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
