<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Medication System Rating Questionnaire assesses the treatment experience of patients using any <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication system that uses nine measures (Convenience, Negative Events, Interference, Self-Monitoring of Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> Burden, Efficacy, Social Burden, Psychological Well-Being, Treatment Satisfaction, Treatment Preference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was administered via an initial online survey, along with other validated measures of treatment satisfaction and medication adherence, with a retest administered within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were 52.5% male, 57.4% aged 40-64 years, 83.6% white and 95.2% non-Hispanic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most (75.6%) had attended college and 58.3% had been diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median inter-item agreement was 0.86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median test-retest reliability was also 0.86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> correlations between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Medication System Rating Questionnaire measures and criterion measures of treatment satisfaction and adherence were statistically significant (P&lt;0.01) in the expected direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlations between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Medication System Rating Questionnaire and the corresponding criterion measures of treatment satisfaction ranged from 0.349 to 0.629 (absolute values; interpolated median 0.568); correlations of the same measures with adherence ranged from 0.384 to 0.450 (absolute values; mean 0.411) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Medication System Rating Questionnaire measures differentiated among groups taking different medications and those using different delivery systems for the same medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: â€‚ This study suggests that the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Medication System Rating Questionnaire has good reliability and validity and provides a more comprehensive set of measures than existing medication satisfaction questionnaires </plain></SENT>
