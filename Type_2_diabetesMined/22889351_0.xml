<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our efforts to discover novel inhibitors of SGLT2, we first generated a 3D pharmacophore model based on the superposition of known inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A search of the Cambridge Structural Database using a series of pharmacophore queries led to the discovery of an O-spiroketal C-arylglucoside scaffold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent chemical examination combined with computational modeling resulted in the identification of the clinical candidate 16d (CSG452, tofogliflozin), which is currently under phase III clinical trials </plain></SENT>
