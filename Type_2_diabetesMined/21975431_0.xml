<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation status of CpG sites in the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 promoter in Type 2 diabetic patients and its correlation to serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>- 1 level, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 32 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 15 healthy controls were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bodymass index, blood pressure, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), and serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 were measured </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation status of CpG sites in theMCP-1 promoter was determined using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The promoter region (2890-3050 bp) was predominantly methylated in PBMC from controls.Methylation of CpGmotifs were less methylated in the patients than in the controls (25% vs 80%; p&lt;0.001), while the level of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in serum was higher in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (193.95±74.96 vs 88.46±55.10; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 promoter methylation was significantly correlated to serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, HbA1c, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that hypomethylation of CpG sites in the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 promoter region may be affected by blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and TG, which then increase the serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 level and may play a role in the vascular complications of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
