<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001993'>Ketoacidosis</z:hpo> at initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pancreatic cell destruction makes early diagnosis and treatment for FT1DM mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the early period of FT1DM, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb)A(1C) levels are not markedly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated serum glycated albumin (GA), which reflects <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> short-term changes in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, as a new clinical index for FT1DM at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects comprised 35 patients with FT1DM who had undergone measurement of HbA(1C) and serum GA at initial visit and 42 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) with HbA(1C) &lt;8.5% and no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1C) was significantly lower in FT1DM than in T2DM, whereas serum GA was significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GA/HbA(1C) ratio was thus significantly higher in FT1DM than in T2DM (3.9 +/- 0.5 versus 2.8 +/- 0.3; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GA/HbA(1C) ratio was &gt;3.2 in 41 of 42 FT1DM patients (98%), compared with only one of 32 T2DM patients (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum GA is significantly higher in FT1DM than in T2DM, whereas HbA(1C) is significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FT1DM can thus be distinguished from untreated T2DM by GA/HbA(1C) ratio at initial visit before treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
