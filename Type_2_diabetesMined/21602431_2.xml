<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This report examines what is known about the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and how future research in these areas might be directed to benefit prevention, interventions, and overall patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An international working group of 32 experts in the pathophysiology, genetics, clinical trials, and clinical care of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and/or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in a conference held on 6-7 January 2011 and cosponsored by The <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">Endocrine</z:chebi> Society, the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association, and the European Association for the Study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A writing group comprising eight participants subsequently prepared this summary and recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants reviewed and discussed published literature and their own unpublished data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The writing group unanimously supported the summary and recommendations as representing the working group's majority or unanimous opinions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The major questions linking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that need to be addressed by combined basic, clinical, and population-based scientific approaches include the following: 1) Why do not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="?"><plain>2) Through what mechanisms do <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> contribute to β-cell decompensation, and if/when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> prevention ensues, how much reduction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence will follow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>3) How does the duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relate to the benefits of weight reduction by lifestyle, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> drugs, and/or bariatric surgery on β-cell function and glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="?"><plain>4) What is necessary for regulatory approval of medications and possibly surgical approaches for preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improved understanding of how <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> relates to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may help advance effective and cost-effective interventions for both conditions, including more tailored therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To expedite this process, we recommend further investigation into the pathogenesis of these coexistent conditions and innovative approaches to their pharmacological and surgical management </plain></SENT>
