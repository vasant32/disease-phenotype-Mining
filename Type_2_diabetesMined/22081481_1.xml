<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assesses the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin versus placebo in Asian patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred sixty-eight drug-naïve adult patients with T2DM and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (HbA(1c)) of 7.0-10.0% (53-86 mmol/mol) were randomized 1 : 1 to receive saxagliptin 5 mg daily or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy endpoints included changes from baseline to week 24 in HbA(1c) , fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve from 0 to 180 min (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> AUC(0-180)), and the proportion of patients achieving HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Saxagliptin provided statistically significant adjusted mean decreases from baseline to week 24 compared with placebo, respectively, in HbA(1c) (-0.84% [-9 mmol/mol] versus -0.34% [-4 mmol/mol]; p &lt; 0.0001), FPG (-0.90 versus -0.17 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.0001), and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> AUC(0-180) (-417 versus -235 mmol · min/L; p = 0.0010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved a therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% [53 mmol/mol]) with saxagliptin (45.8%) versus placebo (28.8%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients who experienced ≥1 AE (excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>) was 43.3% for saxagliptin and 35.6% for placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Few patients in either treatment group experienced an SAE (2.8%, saxagliptin; 1.4%, placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A low proportion of patients reported hypoglycaemic events (1.8%, saxagliptin; 0.7%, placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated in drug-naïve Asian patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
