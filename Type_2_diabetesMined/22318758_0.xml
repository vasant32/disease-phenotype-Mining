<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Caloric restriction in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients quickly improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, independently from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the early effects of a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the relative contributions of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or both to improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, after 1 wk of caloric restriction, in severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Hyperglycemic clamps were performed in 14 severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI, in kg/m(2): &gt;40) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in good <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt; 7.5%) before and after 7 d of a VLCD (400 kcal/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The VLCD caused a 3.22 ± 0.56% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001), 42.0% of which was fat loss, accompanied by decreases in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In parallel, the Disposition Index, which measures the body's capability to dispose of a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, increased from 59.0 ± 6.3 to 75.5 ± 6.3 mL· min(-1) · m(-2) body surface area (P &lt; 0.01), because of improvements in indexes of both first- and second-phase insulin secretion (P &lt; 0.02), but with no changes in insulin sensitivity (P = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The marked improvement in metabolic profile, observed in severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after a 7-d VLCD, was primarily due to the amelioration of β cell function, whereas no contribution of insulin sensitivity was shown </plain></SENT>
