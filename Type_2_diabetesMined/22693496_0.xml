<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a cross-sectional study among 288 elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data collected includes data on sociodemographic, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> history, comorbid diseases, drug use, and activity of daily living (Barthel's index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient also was examined physically, and balance and gait assessment was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> among elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 18.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Female gender (OR: 2.54, P &lt; 0.05), age group more than 75 (OR: 2.97, P &lt; 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (OR: 2.19, P &lt; 0.05), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> (OR: 2.87, P &lt; 0.05) were associated with higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High balance and gait score was associated with reduced risk of fall in elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR: 0.89, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the factors that are associated with higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> among elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were female sex, age group more than 75, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those who had higher balance and gait score were found to be less likely to fall compared with those with lower score </plain></SENT>
