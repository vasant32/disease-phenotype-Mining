<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a multifactorial and polygenic disease, which is considered as a major life threatening problem <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been a worldwide effort in the identification of susceptibility genes for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At present, adequate data is not available dealing with MTHFR (rs1801133) and PPARγ2 (rs1801282) gene polymorphisms and its association with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> cases among north Indian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conceived the need for further studies to investigate MTHFR and PPARγ2 genes polymorphisms and its susceptibility to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in north Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, total 175 subjects including 87 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> cases and 88 controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MTHFR and PPARγ2 gene polymorphism in the cases and controls were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MTHFR gene CC, CT, TT genotype frequencies were obtained 40%, 43%, 17% in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> cases and 56%, 29%, 15% in healthy controls respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OR for CC was 0.54 (95%CI 0.29-0.98, P=0.041, χ2=4.18, power=0.98), for CT 1.76 (95%CI 0.94-3.30, P=0.07, χ2=3.2, power=0.96), for TT 1.2 (95%CI 0.53-2.70, P=0.66, χ2=0.198, power=0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PPARγ2 gene GG CG, CC genotype frequencies were obtained 28%, 41%, 31% in cases and 40%, 39%, 21% in healthy controls respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OR for GG was 0.58 (95%CI 0.30-1.09, P=0.08, χ2=2.9, power=0.96), for CG 1.12 (95%CI 0.61-2.05, P=0.71, χ2=0.137, power=0.778), for CC 1.63 (95%CI 0.82-3.23, P=0.156, χ2=2.01, power=0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It might be recommended that MTHFR CC genotype seems to be a good marker for the early identification of population at risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While we have detected significant difference in allelic frequencies of PPARγ2 C (Proline) and G (Alanine), but at genotypic level significant difference was not detected in this case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study with larger groups may be required to validate the study </plain></SENT>
