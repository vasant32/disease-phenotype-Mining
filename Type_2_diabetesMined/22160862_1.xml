<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A target glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> of less than 7% has commonly been recommended in hopes of preventing both macrovascular and microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although results from trials of intensive glycemic control have generally supported the notion that lower glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values reduce microvascular disease, the evidence for similar benefits for macrovascular disease has been less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As macrovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, this remains one of the more important unresolved clinical questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent results from the ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT studies have challenged the conventional believe that lower glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values should be pursued in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors that may influence whether intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> management is advisable include duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, pre-existing macrovascular disease, hypoglycemic unawareness, and significant comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> goals should account for these factors and be individualized for each patient </plain></SENT>
