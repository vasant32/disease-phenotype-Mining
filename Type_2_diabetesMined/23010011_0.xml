<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T2D results from the impaired secretion or action of the insulin with a clinical phenotype of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the uncontrolled subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease clinical features appear after several years of latent preclinical asymptomatic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, when the disease is full blown, there are limited chances to reverse the disease phenotype; however, it can be managed by controlling diet, changing life style and using medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Understanding pathological mechanisms whereby genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is important for the prevention and treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this regard, approaches such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics are being applied to identify more specific biomarkers for T2D for its early detection, management and devising new therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The emphasis of the present review is to provide updates on the applications of proteomics in addressing T2D with a focus on protein based biomarker discovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the idea of personalized medicine and intervention is also discussed for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment in proteomics perspective </plain></SENT>
