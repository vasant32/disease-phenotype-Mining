<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline, 6 and 12 month data on clinical and laboratory parameters were measured in 3002 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled as part of a prospective quality enhancement research initiative in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A generalised estimating equation model was fitted to assess variables associated with triple target achievement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 54%, 53% and 64% of patients, respectively, had BP, A1C and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> at target; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three goals were met by 19% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of individuals achieving these targets significantly increased during the study [60%, 57%, 76% and 26%, respectively, at the final visit, p &lt; 0.0001 except for A1C, p = 0.27] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A much smaller proportion of patients had adequate control during the entire study period [30%, 39%, 53% and 7%, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, women, patients younger than 65 years and patients of Afro-Canadian origin were less likely to achieve the triple target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: As part of a quality enhancement research initiative, we observed important improvements in the attainment of guidelines-recommended targets in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> followed for a 12-month period in the primary care setting; however, many individuals still failed to achieve and especially maintain optimal goals for therapy, particularly the triple target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results of the multivariable analysis reinforce the need to address barriers to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, particularly in more susceptible groups </plain></SENT>
