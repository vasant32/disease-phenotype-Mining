<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) and their association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD) in 199 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> ([MetS], group A) in comparison with 109 healthy controls (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In group A, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels were significantly (P &lt; .001) higher than group B and exhibited a positive correlation with HbA(1c) (P &lt; .001) and a negative correlation with ankle-brachial index (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the same group, patients with PAD had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels compared with those without PAD (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, T2DM patients with MetS exhibit higher serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter is associated with worse glycemic control and PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a potential contributory role for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in the pathogenesis of PAD in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and MetS in T2DM </plain></SENT>
