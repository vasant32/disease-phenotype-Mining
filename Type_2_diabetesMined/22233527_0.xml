<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of these multiple effects, the GLP-1 receptor system has become an attractive target for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, GLP-1 has significant limitations as a therapeutic due to its rapid degradation (plasma half-life of 1-2 min) by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two main classes of GLP-1-mediated therapies are now in use: DPP-4 inhibitors that reduce the degradation of GLP-1 and DPP-4-resistant GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> can be further divided into short- and long-acting formulations which have differential effects on their mechanisms of action, ultimately resulting in differential effects on their fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the similarities and differences among DPP-4 inhibitors, short-acting GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and long-acting GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that these different GLP-1-mediated therapies are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> necessary tools for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that the choice of which one to use should depend on the specific needs of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is analogous to the current use of modern insulins, as short-, intermediate- and long-acting versions are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> used to optimize the 24-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that GLP-1-mediated therapies have advantages over insulins in terms of hypoglycaemic risk and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, optimized use of these compounds could represent a significant paradigm shift for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
