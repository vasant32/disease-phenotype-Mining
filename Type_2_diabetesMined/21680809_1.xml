<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was designed to evaluate whether daily use of sildenafil could alter endothelial function and improve penile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> in a group of patients with diabetic ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial was conducted with 24 men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were randomized into 2 groups: one receiving daily sildenafil (50 mg, n = 12) and the other placebo (n = 12) for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erectile function was captured subjectively using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and endothelial function was objectively monitored via brachial artery flow-mediated dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the placebo and sildenafil groups, there were no significant differences in average patient age, time from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, duration of ED, or baseline IIEF-5 scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Past medical histories, including smoking, alcohol consumption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, were also similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the conclusion of the 10-week trial, patients who received daily sildenafil had significantly improved erectile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> as captured by IIEF-5 (P &lt; .001) and increased endothelial function via brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was enhanced with daily sildenafil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved erectile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> and enhanced vascular circulation was noted after 10 weeks of daily sildenafil use </plain></SENT>
