<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among various functional foods with an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect, probiotic foods have been reported to repress <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this clinical trial was to assess the effects of probiotic and conventional yogurt on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 30 to 60 y old, were assigned to two groups in this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients in the intervention group consumed 300 g/d of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and those in the control group consumed 300 g/d of conventional yogurt for 6Â wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood samples, 24-h dietary recalls, and anthropometric measurements were collected at the baseline and at the end of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Probiotic yogurt significantly decreased fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (P &lt; 0.05) and increased erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activities and total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the serum malondialdehyde concentration significantly decreased compared with the baseline value in both groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant changes from baseline were shown in insulin concentration and erythrocyte catalase activity within either group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The consumption of probiotic yogurt improved fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that probiotic yogurt is a promising agent for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
