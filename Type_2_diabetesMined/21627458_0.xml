<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is well accepted that glycemic control in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) is affected by systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of periodontal therapy on these systemic factors may be related to improvement on glycemic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to assess over a period of 6 months the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy on serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), d-8-iso <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2a (d-8-iso) as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 on patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty participants with type 2 DM and moderate to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> were randomized into intervention (IG) and control (CG) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IG received scaling and root planing, whereas CG received supragingival cleaning at baseline and scaling and root planing at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants of both groups were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Periodontal data recorded at each visit included probing depth, clinical attachment loss, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> on probing, and gingival index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected at each visit for the assay of serum glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1c), hsCRP, d-8-iso, MMP-2, and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there was a trend to a reduction in hsCRP, d-8-iso and MMP-9 it did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 levels remained unchanged after periodontal treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Effective non-surgical periodontal treatment of participants with type 2 DM and moderate to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> improved significantly A1c levels but did not result in a statistically significant improvement in hsCRP, d-8-iso, MMP-2, and MMP-9 levels </plain></SENT>
