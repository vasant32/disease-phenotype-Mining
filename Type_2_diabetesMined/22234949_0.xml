<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on its multiple roles in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, atherogenesis and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, we hypothesised that activin A could be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Activin A and follistatin were measured in 102 patients with T2DM and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography was performed in a sub-population of patients and associations with activin A were examined using multiple linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum activin A and the activin A/follistatin ratio were increased in patients with T2DM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) compared with healthy volunteers and the elevated activin A was associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerotic burden as determined by the proportion of â‰¥2 vessel disease (p = 0.035) after multivariable-adjusted trend analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association between presence of CAD or extent score and activin A was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM, increased activin A may reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> underlying pathophysiological processes involved in development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
