<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA) refers to a specific type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo>, presence of islet auto-antibodies, insulin independence at the time of diagnosis, and rapid decline in β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LADA among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> varies from 2% to 20% according to the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since most studies on the prevalence of LADA performed in Korea were conducted in patients who had been tested for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADAb), a selection bias could not be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the prevalence and clinical characteristics of LADA among adult patients recently diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 462 patients who were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within 5 years from the time this study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured GADAb, fasting insulin level, fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, HbA1c, and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles and collected data on clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of LADA was 4.3% (20/462) among adult patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the GADAb-negative patients, the GADAb-positive patients had lower fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (1.2±0.8 ng/mL vs. 2.0±1.2 ng/mL, P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other metabolic features were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of LADA is 4.3% among Korean adult patients with recently diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Korean LADA patients exhibited decreased insulin secretory capacity as reflected by lower C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
