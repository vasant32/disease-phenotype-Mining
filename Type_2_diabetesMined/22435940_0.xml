<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Many reports have shown that vegetable intake is effective in inhibiting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, although the amount of vegetable intake required to be effective remains as unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study therefore aimed to clarify the relationship between the amount of vegetable intake and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and other metabolic parameters using male Japanese type 2 diabetic patients aged 65 years or older as subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants were 417 male type 2 diabetic patients aged 65 years or older enrolled in the Japanese Elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary intakes were measured by using the Food Frequency Questionnaires method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into five groups by their daily total vegetable intake (A1: ~100 g, A2: 100~150 g, A3: 150~200 g, A4: 200~300 g, A5: 300 g~), and compared HbA1c and other metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the relationship between daily green vegetable intake and HbA1c and other metabolic parameters were examined among five groups divided by quintile methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant decreases in HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and waist circumference with an increase of total vegetable intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease of HbA1c levels was observed in patients with a daily total vegetable intake of 150 g or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a significant decrease of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in patients with a total vegetable intake of 200 g or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels showed a decreasing tendency with the increase of green vegetable intake, and HbA1c levels in the Q1 group (green vegetable intake: less than 40 g) was significantly higher than those in the other four groups (anovaP = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were significant decreases of body mass index, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and waist circumference with the increase of green vegetable intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> levels decreased significantly from the Q3 group (green vegetable intake: 70 g or more) to the Q5 group (green vegetable intake: 130 g or more; anovaP = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the group with a lower intake of total vegetables and green vegetables, the protein energy ratio decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As a result, the fat energy ratio and energy intake tended to increase with the decrease of total and green vegetable intakes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, intake of grains, sweets and alcoholic beverages increased with the decrease of total vegetable intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast, intake of nuts, potatoes, sugar, legumes, fruit, seaweed and fish increased with the increase of total vegetable intake CONCLUSIONS: Daily total vegetable intake of 200 g or more, and green vegetable intake of 70 g or more correlated with improved control of HbA1c and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in elderly type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients through achieving a well-balanced diet </plain></SENT>
