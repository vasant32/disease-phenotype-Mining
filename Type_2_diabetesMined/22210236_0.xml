<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leptin is a plausible mediating factor because it has been related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in nondiabetic populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess whether leptin is related to depressive symptoms in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand fifty-seven subjects (48.5% women, mean [standard deviation] age = 67.9 [4.2] years) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed for depressive symptoms using the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale and other clinical variables by interview and physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma leptin was determined by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the relationship between depressive symptoms and ln leptin while adjusting for other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mediation analysis was performed to test whether depressive symptoms mediated the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In univariate analyses, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were related to leptin in men (r = 0.214, p &lt; .001) and women (r = 0.146, p = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When adjusting for other covariates including body mass index, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and treatment with antidepressants, insulin, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, using a hierarchical multiple linear regression, depressive symptoms (ln Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score) were significant only in men (B = 0.083, standard error = 0.037, p = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the mediation analysis, depressive symptoms partially mediated the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (body mass index) on leptin in men but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a sex difference in the relationship between depressive symptoms and leptin in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with a positive association in men but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte-derived factors are associated with depressive symptoms in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
