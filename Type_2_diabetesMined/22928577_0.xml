<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The natural history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) is characterized by progressive deterioration of pancreatic β-cell function, leading to worsening glycemia over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapies have not yet been shown to profoundly alter this natural history, many patients ultimately will require exogenous insulin therapy to obtain adequate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the temporary use of short-term intensive insulin therapy early in the course of T2DM has recently emerged as a therapeutic option that may offer favourable long-term effects on β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, after receiving this treatment, many patients will experience sustained euglycemia without requiring any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This apparent 'remission' of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is likely secondary to improved β-cell function and can last for more than a year, although it is not sustained and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> eventually will return </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, owing to its effects on β-cell function, short-term intensive insulin therapy holds promise as a means for modifying the natural history of T2DM and warrants further study in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this report, we will review the rationale and evidence underlying this interesting therapeutic option, and its implications for both clinical research and the management of patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
