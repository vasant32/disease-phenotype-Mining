<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A large proportion of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> have diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite current therapies including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> progresses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> in most of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new treatments for such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of silymarin, an herbal drug with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-inflammatory properties, in preventing the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: 60 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion &gt;300 mg/24 h) despite treatment with the maximum dose of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor for more than 6 months and estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 equal groups to receive three 140-mg tablets of silymarin or 3 tablets of placebo daily for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was absolute change in urinary albumin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (UACR) from baseline to the end of the treatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: UACR and urinary and serum levels of TNF-α (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α; an inflammatory marker), malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>; an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> marker), and TGFβ (transforming growth factor β; a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>) at baseline and the end of the treatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although UACR decreased in both groups, this decrement was significantly higher in the silymarin compared with the placebo group; mean difference in change in UACR between the 2 groups was -347 (95% CI, -690 to -4) mg/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Urinary levels of TNF-α and urinary and serum levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> also decreased significantly in the silymarin compared with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and short duration of the treatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Silymarin reduces urinary excretion of albumin, TNF-α, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and may be considered as a novel addition to the anti-diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> armamentarium </plain></SENT>
