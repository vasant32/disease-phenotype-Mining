<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Physical co-morbidity including type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is more prevalent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little consistent evidence that co-morbidity with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and/or other diseases leads to excess mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated whether co-morbidity with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other somatic diseases is increased in schizophrenics, and if these are equally or more relevant predictors of mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> than in age- and gender-matched hospitalised controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 2000-2007, 679 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> were admitted to University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Co-morbidities were compared with 88,778 age- and gender group-matched hospital controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictors of mortality were identified using forward Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> compared to hospitalised controls (11.3% versus 6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial prevalence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the 100 later deceased schizophrenic patients (24.0%) than in those 579 surviving over 7 years (9.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictors of mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> were found to be age (relative risk [RR] = 1.1/year), type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (RR = 2.2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (RR = 2.7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (RR = 2.9) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> (RR = 3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on mortality was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> than in hospital controls (RR = 2.2 versus RR = 1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In agreement, deceased schizophrenics had significantly suffered more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> than deceased controls (24.0 versus 10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relative risks of mortality for other disorders and their prevalence in later deceased subjects did not significantly differ between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Schizophrenics have more and additionally suffer more from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: co-morbidity with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> in comparison with hospital controls; type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> causes significant excess mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, monitoring for and prevention of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is of utmost relevance in hospitalised patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
