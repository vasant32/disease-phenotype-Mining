<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using data on 513 Medicare Advantage plan-year observations for 2007 and 2008, the authors estimate multivariate regressions for 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care quality measures: (1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> screening, (2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> screening, and (3) <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> eye exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plan case mix is measured with the percentage of a plan's enrollees who have type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with and without comorbidities and the percentage of a plan's enrollees who have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with and without comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plans with a higher percentage of enrollees with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with comorbidity and plans with a higher percentage of enrollees with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without comorbidity have lower performance, on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finding evidence of a relationship between case mix and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set performance reinforces the argument for developing standardized risk adjustment or stratification methods in public reporting and pay-for-performance efforts </plain></SENT>
