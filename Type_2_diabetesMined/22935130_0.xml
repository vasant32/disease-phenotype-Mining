<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A secondary analysis of data extracted from the AusDiab study was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were classified as known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (KDM), newly detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (NDDM), impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> according to results of a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6.9%; 49.6% of participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (NDDM+KDM) were classified as NDDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although study factors were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence, most were not associated with proportion of diabetic participants classified as NDDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, NDDM was more likely among those who spoke English at home, were in good general health and did not report past history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS; Although a range of personal and socioeconomic factors are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence, these factors are not similarly associated with prior detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the importance of systematic approaches to screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk focussed on the whole population, with selective screening based on multi-factorial assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk using the AUSDRISK Assessment Tool </plain></SENT>
