<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized, non-inferiority (margin of 0.4%), parallel, prospective, multi-country, 48-week, open-label study, patients (n = 426) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications were assigned to either initiating therapy with one daily LM25 injection, progressing up to three daily injections (full analysis set n = 211; per protocol set n = 177) or initiating therapy with one daily glargine injection and progressing up to three daily insulin lispro injections (full analysis set n = 212; per protocol set n = 184) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LM25 therapy was found to be non-inferior to glargine + insulin lispro therapy by study end (upper limit of 95% CI &lt; 0.4), with a least-squares mean difference (95% CI) in HbA(1c) (LM25 minus glargine + insulin lispro) of -0.4 mmol/mol (95% CI -2.7 to 1.9); -0.04% (95% CI -0.25 to 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found in the percentage of patients achieving HbA(1c) targets or postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in insulin dose, number of injections and weight change during the course of the study were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups experienced similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> rates and safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications, glycaemic control when initiating and intensifying with LM25 therapy was found to be non-inferior to treatment with glargine + insulin lispro therapy </plain></SENT>
