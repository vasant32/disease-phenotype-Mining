<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test whether <z:mp ids='MP_0008034'>increased lipolysis</z:mp> and FFA levels induced by insulin withdrawal are accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0009126'>increased adipose tissue</z:hpo> (AT) contents of adipose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> lipase (ATGL) and/or altered intracellular ATGL regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Nine patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined twice in a randomized crossover design after 16 h of 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>/insulin withdrawal and 2) euglycemia/insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn and a sc abdominal AT biopsy was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital research unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (7.2 ± 0.3 vs. 11.2 ± 0.8 mmol/liter) and FFA (0.51 ± 0.05 vs. 0.65 ± 0.04 mmol/liter) were increased and insulin levels decreased after insulin withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AT ATGL protein tended to be increased (P = 0.075) after insulin withdrawal; by contrast, AT protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> content of perilipin A (Plin) and G(0)/G(1) switch gene 2 (G0S2), known negative regulators of ATGL activity, were decreased by 20-30% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measured parameters related to hormone-sensitive lipase remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein content of Plin and G0S2 and borderline increased ATGL protein in sc AT from poorly controlled type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that increased ATGL activity may contribute to the elevated lipolysis and circulating FFA levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin withdrawal and metabolic dysregulation in type 2 diabetic patients and that this mechanism may be modifiable </plain></SENT>
