<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the use of incretin-based therapies, such as GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and DPP-4 inhibitors, has increased dramatically due to their demonstrated efficacy, low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> when used as monotherapy, and reasonable tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given their effects on glycemic parameters and the likelihood of aiding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> provide a unique treatment option for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased clinical experience and study of incretin-based therapies will help answer questions about safety issues that have arisen from post-marketing reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potential benefit of incretin-based therapies in the treatment of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> is currently an active area of inquiry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the potential benefits of incretin-based therapies in the arena of cardiovascular risk reduction are promising, results from ongoing outcomes-based studies will help determine the role of these agents in this setting </plain></SENT>
