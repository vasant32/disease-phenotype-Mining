<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However no study has yet been conducted to determine the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management, fasting blood sugar and quality of life among type 2 diabetic patients with foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management, fasting blood sugar and quality of life (QOL) among type 2 diabetic patients with foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> who received the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of 80 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were given a questionnaire regarding demographic data, fasting blood sugar, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Self-management was assessed by evaluating dietary intake, exercise, medication, self-monitoring, hygienic and foot care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WHOQOL-BREF-THAI, comprising of 26 items, was used to investigate quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A purposive sampling technique was used for selecting patients from two outpatient departments, surgical and rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were collected between September 2009 and October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Simple descriptive statistics were used to provide the basic information and Pearson's product moment was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority (51.3%) of study participants were males and in the age group of &gt; 60 years (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over half (61.5%) of the participants had a severity of foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> at the first level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed that there was a negative significant association between fasting blood sugar and quality of life (r = -0.30, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management had a significant association with quality of life (r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results in the present study suggest that good quality of life is significantly related to good <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management and fasting blood sugar control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these patients should be encouraged to perform self-management for controlling their blood sugar and improving their quality of life </plain></SENT>
