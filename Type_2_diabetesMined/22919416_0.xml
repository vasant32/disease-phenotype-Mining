<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of CAM in the treatment or management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an emerging health issue given the potential side effects and benefits associated with the use of this kind of medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper examined patterns and determinants of CAM practitioner use in Queensland, Australia, using a large population-based sample of people with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study found that within a 12-month period, 7.7% of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> used the services of CAM practitioners alongside or as a complement to conventional health care service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Younger age, female gender, a higher education, having private health insurance, and engagement in preventive health behaviours are significant predictors of individuals who are more likely to visit a CAM practitioner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in CAM practitioner use between people with type 1, type 2 insulin requiring, or type 2 noninsulin requiring <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings highlight the need for further research on the role of CAM in the prevention and management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
