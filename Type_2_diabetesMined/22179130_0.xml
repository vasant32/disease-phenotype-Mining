<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of pinitol on glycemic control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and adipocytokine levels in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 66 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had been taking oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> for at least 3 months were enrolled and randomized to receive pinitol (n = 33) or matching placebo (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects took 1,200 mg pinitol or placebo and maintained their current oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean HbA1c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HOMA-IR were significantly lowered more in patients taking pinitol than in those given a placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had an HbA1c over 8.0% showed a greater reduction (p &lt; 0.01) than those who had an HbA1c below 8.0% (p =0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in the group of patients with a HOMA-IR over 2.5, there was a significant decrease in HbA1c compared to that in the group of patients with a HOMA-IR below 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the changes in adiponectin, FFA and CRP between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pinitol can mediate insulin action to improve glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, especially in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
