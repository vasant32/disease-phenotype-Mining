<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory cytokines are produced by different cell types and secreted into the circulation, where they regulate different tissues through their local, central and peripheral actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on C-reactive protein (CRP), a well-established marker of the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-Î±, an inflammatory marker strongly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and on adiponectin, a cytokine produced by adipose tissue and associated with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While it is clear from the literature that these cytokines play a major role in the development of T2D or, in the case of adiponectin, its prevention, the best strategy for favourably altering the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
