<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used data from the Look AHEAD trial to determine the impact of an intensive lifestyle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> intervention (ILI) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> support and education (DSE) on changes in bone mineral density (BMD) over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to ILI or DSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a substudy of BMD conducted at 5 of 16 clinical centers, hip, spine, and whole body dual X-ray absorptiometry scans were obtained at baseline and 1-year later on 642 of 739 ILI and 632 of 740 DSE participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, mean age was 58.4 years, and average body mass index was 35.2 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total hip BMD T-score was &lt;-2.5 in 1% and &lt;-1.0 in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was greater in ILI than DSE (-8.6% versus -0.7%), and glycemic control and fitness were also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone loss over 1 year was greater in ILI at the total hip (-1.4% versus -0.4%; p &lt; 0.001) and femoral neck (-1.5% versus -0.8%; p = 0.009), but change in BMD for the lumbar spine and whole body did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ILI, bone loss at the total hip was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in men and women and with poorer glycemic control in men, but was not associated with changes in fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One year of an intensive lifestyle intervention in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, was associated with a modest increase in hip bone loss despite improved fitness and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
