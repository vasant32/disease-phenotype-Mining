<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Clinical guidelines for cardiometabolic risk management indicate a simple threshold-based strategy for treatment, but physicians and their patients may be reluctant to modify drug treatment after a single elevated measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined how repeated measurements of blood pressure, cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c affect general practitioners' decisions to start or intensify medication in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated whether medication burden altered these decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in 3029 patients managed by 62 general practitioners (GPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the predictive value of the last risk factor measurement, the number of successive measurements above target level and the percentage change between the last two measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medication burden was assessed as the number of drugs concurrently used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effects on treatment decisions were estimated by multilevel logistic regression analysis, correcting for clustering at GP level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Repeated high levels of diastolic blood pressure increased the likelihood to start <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication (OR=2.08, CI 1.37 to 3.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeated high <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels affected intensification of oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication (OR=1.71, CI 1.44 to 2.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modification of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medication was limited, and only affected by the last total cholesterol level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Starting treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three risk factors, as well as intensifying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment, was more likely in patients already using more drugs for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Waiting for the next measurement before deciding to change medication can explain in part the apparent undertreatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, but not for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Medication burden was not a barrier for treatment modification </plain></SENT>
