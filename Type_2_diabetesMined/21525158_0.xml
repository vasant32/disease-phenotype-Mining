<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs780094 (intron 16) and the missense SNP rs1260326 (P446L) in the GCKR gene are strongly associated with increased circulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and C-reactive protein levels and, paradoxically, reductions in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We sought to replicate these associations and evaluate interactions with lifestyle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> interventions in the multiethnic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We genotyped the two GCKR SNP in 3346 DPP participants and evaluated association with progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and both baseline levels and changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), oral disposition index, and inflammatory markers along with their interactions with DPP interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GCKR variation did not predict development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the 446L allele was associated with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and C-reactive protein levels (both P &lt; 0.0001) and lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lifestyle intervention was associated with a decrease in magnitude of the effect of the 446L allele on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (interaction P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was more effective in reducing HOMA-IR in carriers of the P446 allele (interaction P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive lifestyle intervention appears to partially mitigate the effect of the 446L allele on higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, whereas the P446 allele appears to enhance responsiveness to the HOMA-IR-lowering effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
