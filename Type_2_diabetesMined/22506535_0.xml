<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: Twenty-one studies covering 8,111 subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fixed or random effect model used was based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: A significant association of the intron 4a allele in the NOS3 4b/a polymorphism with reduced risk of DR was found in dominant (OR 0.778, 95% CI 0.654-0.926) and additive (OR 0.809, 95% CI 0.698-0.937) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis revealed that the intron 4a allele additive model (OR 0.807, 95% CI 0.697-0.935) was associated with DR risk in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found a marginally significant association of the C allele in the T-786C polymorphism with reduced risk of proliferative DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no statistically significant association was observed between the G894T polymorphism and DR risk, either in the overall or subgroup analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The intron 4a allele of the 4b/a polymorphism in the eNOS gene has protective effects against DR, especially in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The C allele of the T-786C polymorphism may be a protective factor for proliferative DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the G894T polymorphism does not appear to influence the development of DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This conclusion warrants confirmation by further studies </plain></SENT>
