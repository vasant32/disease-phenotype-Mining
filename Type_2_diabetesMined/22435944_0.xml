<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from 1173 patients aged 65-84 years who were enrolled in the J-EDIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed prospectively for 6 years to determine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> on serum cholesterol levels, and cardiovascular and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the study protocol allowed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> to be prescribed according to the clinical needs of each patient, we regarded the J-EDIT data as if they came from a cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We adjusted for clinical characteristics during the study as time-dependent confounders using two methods, inverse-probability-of-treatment (IPT) weighting and g-estimation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total follow-up period was 5310.8 person-years (5.7 years of median follow up), during which 202 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> was associated with moderate reductions in cholesterol levels: 24.2 mg/dL for total cholesterol, 22.9 mg/dL for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol and 24.3 mg/dL for non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> at the first post-treatment year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, the proportion of patients who achieved targeted levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> clearly increased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients in 476.6 person-years among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-treated and 113 untreated patients in 4721.4 person-years had cardiovascular events (the composite end-point of fatal/non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, coronary intervention, and fatal/non-fatal cerebrovascular disease); hazard ratio (HR) = 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.19-1.16, P = 0.10, and HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.05-1.87, P = 0.21 from IPT weighting and g-estimation method, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, seven in 475.0 person-years among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-treated and 149 untreated patients in 4682.4 person-years had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related events (the composite end-point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> in addition to cardiovascular event); HR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12-0.77, P = 0.01, and HR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.09-0.89, P = 0.03 from IPT weighting and g-estimation method, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When cardiovascular events were further differentiated into coronary vascular and cerebrovascular events, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> especially decreased the cerebrovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> to lower cholesterol levels in elderly Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> appears to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related events </plain></SENT>
