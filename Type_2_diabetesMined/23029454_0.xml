<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of these loci with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have not been examined in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a replication study to investigate the association of these 7 susceptibility loci with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 11,319 Japanese participants (8,318 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 3,001 controls) for each of the 7 SNPs-rs5945326 near DUSP9, rs3923113 near GRB14, rs16861329 in ST6GAL1, rs1802295 in VPS26A, rs7178572 in HMG20A, rs2028299 near AP3S2, and rs4812829 in HNF4A-and examined the association of each of these 7 SNPs with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SNPs had the same direction of effect (odds ratio [OR]&gt;1.0) as in the original reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One SNP, rs5945326 near DUSP9, was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a genome-wide significance level (p = 2.21×10(-8); OR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-1.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 6 SNPs derived from South Asian GWAS were not significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population by themselves (p≥0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a genetic risk score constructed from 6 South Asian GWAS derived SNPs was significantly associated with Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 8.69×10(-4), OR  = 1.06 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>95% CI; 1.03-1.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that the DUSP9 locus is a common susceptibility locus for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across different ethnicities, and 6 loci identified in South Asian GWAS also have significant effect on susceptibility to Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
