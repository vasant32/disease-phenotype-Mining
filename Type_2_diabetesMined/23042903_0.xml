<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms, however, by which <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alters connective tissue metabolism, especially tendon are poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to study the effect of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on mechanical, histological and molecular properties of the intact and healing Achilles tendon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right Achilles tendon was transected in 11 male diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and 10 age- and sex-matched Wistar control rats, while left Achilles tendon was left intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 2 weeks post-injury, intact and injured tendons were assessed by biomechanical testing and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collagen I and III, biglycan, versican, MMP-13 and MMP-3 gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and protein distribution was studied by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intact tendons exhibited only small differences between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In injured tendons, however, a significantly smaller transverse area and lower stiffness was found in diabetic GK compared to Wistar control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This correlated with impaired structural organization of collagen fibres and a reduced expression of collagen I and III in the injured tendons of diabetic GK compared to Wistar control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MMP-3 gene expression was down-regulated in the injured diabetic GK tendons compared to injured Wister controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that in rat model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> tendon healing is impaired mainly due to altered expression of collagen and MMPs reflecting decreased degradation of matrix proteins and impaired tissue remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that therapeutic modulation of collagens or MMPs might be targets for new regenerative approaches in operated, injured or possibly degenerative tendon diseases in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
