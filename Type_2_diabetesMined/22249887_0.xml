<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ileal transposition (IT) as one of the effective treatments for non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> has been widely investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying profound improvements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis are still uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to explore the myocardial insulin signal transduction and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> rats after IT surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats or Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to diabetic IT, diabetic sham-IT, and non-diabetic control SD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Food intake, body weight, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin tolerance, and serum glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the myocardial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and the protein levels of insulin receptor-beta (IR-β), phosphorylated IR-β, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphorylated IRS-1, and IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) from myocardial cell lysates were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the expression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 4 (GLUT4) in both skeletal muscle and myocardial cell lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to sham operations within 6 months, IT surgery for GK rats did (1) result in less food intake and <z:mp ids='MP_0008489'>reduced body weight gain</z:mp> over time, (2) improve plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis with increased serum GLP-1 secretion and myocardial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, (3) increase protein expression of insulin signaling pathway, including IR-β, IRS-1 and their phosphorylation levels, and IRS-1-associated PI3K in the myocardium, and (4) enhance the protein levels of membrane GLUT4 in skeletal muscle and myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IT surgery ameliorates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disorder in GK type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, IT surgery is effective in up-regulating both myocardial insulin signaling and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal within 6 months </plain></SENT>
