<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various potential health effects of coffee have been extensively studied, but data on habitual coffee consumption and the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> have only recently been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We systematically reviewed cohort studies (identified after searching through MEDLINE) from the period of January 2001 to August 2011 to find out the relation of degree of coffee consumption with development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on study design, participant characteristics, measurement of coffee consumption and outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and estimates of associations was reviewed independently by 3 reviewers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The review included 13 cohort studies including 12, 47,387 participants and 9473 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> amongst people with different degrees of coffee consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that habitual coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants who drank 4 to 6 cups and more than 6 to 7 cups of coffee per day had a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those who drank less than 2 cups per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Advantage of filtered coffee over pot boiled, decaffeinated coffee over caffeinated coffee and stronger inverse correlation in &lt; 60 years age group was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, based on this review, increasing coffee consumption as a public health strategy can't be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More detailed studies of coffee consumption, including appropriate measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and insulin sensitivity, are required </plain></SENT>
