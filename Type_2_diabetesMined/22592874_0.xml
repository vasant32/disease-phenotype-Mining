<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are inversely associated with carotid artery intima media thickness in 746 (age 53 ± 7 yrs) men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured common carotid intima media thickness and defined carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as a carotid intima media thickness &gt; 1.0 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiorespiratory fitness was directly measured by peak oxygen uptake using expired gases analysis during a standard treadmill test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness was independently associated with common carotid intima media thickness in multivariable regression (β = -0.15, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for established risk factors, high and moderate cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with lower odds ratios for having carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>--0.49 (95% CI, 0.30-0.81), and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.38-0.92), respectively--as compared with low cardiorespiratory fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each 1 metabolic equivalent increment higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with 27% (OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.87) lower prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high cardiorespiratory fitness is inversely associated with common carotid intima media thickness in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
