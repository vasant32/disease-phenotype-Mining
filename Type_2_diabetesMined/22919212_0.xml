<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were randomly distributed into two groups receiving either SRP and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> fiber or SRP alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated clinically with gingival index, plaque index, probing depth, and relative attachment level, and bio-chemically with HbA1c, C Reactive Protein, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clinical parameters was seen in the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bio-chemical analysis also revealed similar results except for cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High density lipoprotein</z:chebi> who did not show any significant reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Locally delivered <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> as a better treatment modality compared to SRP alone </plain></SENT>
