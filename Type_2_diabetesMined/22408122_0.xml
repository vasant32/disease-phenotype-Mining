<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Both type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> therapy are highly prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be more susceptible to adverse effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, and it is recommended that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> therapy is avoided for fear of worsening glycaemic control, the extent to which this advice is followed and the consequences when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> are prescribed are poorly documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to assess the characteristics of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prescribed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> in a real-world setting and to quantify resulting adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiometabolic variables, body fat distribution, cognitive function and mood were studied in the 1066 participants of the Edinburgh Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, of whom 162 (15%) were taking systemic, topical or inhaled <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">Glucocorticoid</z:chebi> therapy was more common in women and in smokers but was not avoided in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>People taking <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> were more centrally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with slightly higher HbA1c and total serum cholesterol but were no more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">Glucocorticoid</z:chebi> treatment was associated with substantially lower mood and greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women taking <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> therapy were twice as likely to report depressive symptoms compared with those not taking treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">Glucocorticoid</z:chebi> therapy was also associated with poorer cognitive function among those with subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, as indicated by low ankle-brachial pressure index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">Glucocorticoids</z:chebi> are prescribed commonly for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> despite being associated with adverse indices of glycaemic control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, mood and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
