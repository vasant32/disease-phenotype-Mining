<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In children and adolescents, the prevalence of being prescribed antidepressant or antipsychotic medications was examined as well as the association of these medications with developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>.Method: A retrospective cohort design evaluating South Carolina Medicaid medical and pharmacy claims between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2006, was employed to identify 4,070 children and adolescents diagnosed initially with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 39% of whom were later reclassified as type 1 (using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The added risk of developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> posed by the use of antidepressants or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> was investigated in this cohort, controlling for individual risk factors and comorbid cardiometabolic conditions.Results: Use of antidepressants or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> alone, or the 2 in combination, conferred an increased risk (1.3 to 2 times greater) of having diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and several comorbid cardiometabolic conditions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, psychiatric illnesses generally developed and were treated after the initial development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.Conclusions: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was diagnosed and treated in 10% to 20% of this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While antidepressants and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, alone or in combination, are associated with a diagnosis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and its cardiometabolic comorbidities by adolescence, they do not appear to be an explanatory factor in the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in this age group and do not appear to cloud the initial, overlapping clinical picture between type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
