<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pooled OR (odds ratio) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the strength of association between rs10811661 polymorphism and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OR with 95 % CI were performed for allele contrasts, additive genetic model, dominant genetic model and recessive genetic model, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect model was used if there was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Funnel plots were used to predict publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>17 studies with 29,990 cases and 40,977 controls were enrolled in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant association was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the four genetic models: allele contrast (OR = 1.21, 95 % CI 1.18-1.24), additive genetic model (OR = 1.51, 95 % CI 1.40-1.63), dominant genetic model (OR = 1.37, 95 % CI 1.28-1.47) and recessive genetic model (OR = 1.25, 95 % CI 1.21-1.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis indicated that rs10811661 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
