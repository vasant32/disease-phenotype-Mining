<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although most people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receive their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in primary care, only a limited amount is known about the quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the provision and receipt of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care delivered in UK primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Postal surveys with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> healthcare professionals and a random sample of 100 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 99 UK primary care practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 326/361 (90.3%) doctors, 163/186 (87.6%) nurses and 3591 patients (41.8%) returned a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicians reported giving advice about lifestyle behaviours (e.g. 88% would routinely advise about calorie restriction; 99.6% about increasing exercise) more often than patients reported having received it (43% and 42%) and correlations between clinician and patient report were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' reported levels of confidence about managing their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were moderately high; a median (range) of 21% (3% to 39%) of patients reporting being not confident about various areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practices have organisational structures in place and are, as judged by routine quality indicators, delivering high quality care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There remain evidence-practice gaps in the care provided and in the self confidence that patients have for key aspects of self management and further research is needed to address these issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future research should use robust designs and appropriately designed studies to investigate how best to improve this situation </plain></SENT>
