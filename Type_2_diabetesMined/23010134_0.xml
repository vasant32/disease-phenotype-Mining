<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Improving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control is a critical issue world-wide, because mortality rates and costs are increasing dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is positively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the availability of practical screening tools suitable for determining and modifying healthy or unhealthy lifestyle choices is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main aim of this study was to determine the appropriateness of the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and health promotion scale (T2DHPS) for use in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study examined the Cronbach's alpha, content validity, construct and concurrent validity of the Chinese language version of the T2DHPS for assessing lifestyle and disease control among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dimensions of the T2DHPS were generated from the Chinese version of adult health promotion and interviews with experts, and were corroborated by the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 323 patients previously diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional, descriptive design questionnaire was developed and tested at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outpatient departments in three teaching hospitals between August 2010 and June 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Construct validity was established using factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total and subscale scores of the T2DHPS were correlated with biomarkers of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control for concurrent validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's sphericity tests showed that the sample met the criteria required for factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A 28-item Likert-type scale of the T2DHPS was established, and explained 56.7% of the total variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The simplified version of the T2DHPS was made up of six dimensions of behavior: physical activity, risk reduction, stress-management, enjoy life, health responsibility and a healthy diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reliability coefficient for the total scale was 0.89, and alpha coefficients for the subscales ranged from 0.63 to 0.86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Concurrent validity indicated that the T2DHPS is significantly positively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T2DHPS was shown to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and can possibly predict diabetic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This scale appears to be a useful screening tool for type 2 diabetic people in primary health care settings, to promote health status through modification of an unhealthy lifestyle </plain></SENT>
