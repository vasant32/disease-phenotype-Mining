<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of partial replacement of a high-fat diet with menhaden oil on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-fat/low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> diabetic rats were used to examine the influence of replacing 50% of the source of the high-fat diet (lard) with menhaden oil, a natural source of n-3 fatty acids, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included analyses of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease, serum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver fatty</z:e> acid composition, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and adiponectin levels, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity and innervation of the hindpaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic rats were insulin resistant and menhaden oil did not improve whole animal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Menhaden oil did not improve elevated HbA(1)C levels or serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels but serum levels of adiponectin were significantly increased and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> was significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic rats were thermal hypoalgesic, had reduced motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities and intraepidermal nerve fiber profiles were decreased in the hindpaw and these endpoints were significantly improved with menhaden oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found that enrichment of a high-fat diet with menhaden oil improved a number of endpoints associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
