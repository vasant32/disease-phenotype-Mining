<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patient characteristics, HbA(1c) values, hypoglycaemic treatment and physician characteristics were collected from the electronic records of a panel of French general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with the time until intensification of treatment were studied with the Cox model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 17 493 orally treated patients with at least two available HbA(1c) values, 3118 patients (18%) required treatment intensification; 65% were on monotherapy, 31% on bitherapy and 4% on tritherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were followed for a maximum of 14 months or until treatment was intensified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was intensified after the second high HbA(1c) value for 1212 patients (39%); this was immediate for 13% of these patients, within 6 months for 39% and within one year for 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment intensification was less likely the older the patient, and more likely the higher the first HbA(1c) value, up to an HbA(1c) threshold of 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic inertia in caring for type 2 diabetic patients in France is frequent, at least for patients treated in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This inadequate glycaemic control would be expected to have significant patient and public health consequences, with higher rates of associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
