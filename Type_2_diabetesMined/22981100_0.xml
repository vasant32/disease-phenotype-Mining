<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on a cohort of 243 patients living with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in two Maltese Health Centre catchment areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A convenience sampling was adopted to recruit subjects from a local pilot <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> foot screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical assessments used during this screening program were based on validated and previously published tools such as: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> disability score, vibration perception threshold, Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, vascular status and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001760'>foot deformities</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results from this study demonstrate that risk factors for foot deterioration and ulceration are common in Maltese population living with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whilst, metabolic outcomes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> were present in most subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>peripheral sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001760'>foot deformities</z:hpo> were also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six per cent of the sample had to be referred for further vascular assessment following this screening program due to their critical vascular status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A significant proportion of Maltese participants living with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> presented with vascular insufficiency, abnormal neural function and deformities in the feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metabolic outcomes such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> and high levels of cholesterol were also highly prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strengthening of existing screening structures is imperative in order to reduce the burden of this disease in Malta </plain></SENT>
