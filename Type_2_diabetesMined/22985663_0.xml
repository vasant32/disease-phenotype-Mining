<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this insulin treatment, continuous patient education, co-operation between the medical team (diabetologist, dietician and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-nurses) and the patient as well as the availability of modern insulins, pens and glucometers are of great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clearly, the basal-bolus treatment with human insulin has advantages over the conservative (conventional) treatment with twice daily premix insulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the basal-bolus treatment with insulin-analogues proved to be superior in some aspects as compared to human insulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intensive insulin treatment (basal-bolus regime with insulin-analogues) approaches the optimal insulin substitution and, with its use the adequate correction of each element of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> triad (fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c) should be considered feasible even in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
