<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Although soybeans have the ability to attenuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, it is insufficient to alleviate type 2 diabetic symptoms and different types of fermented soybeans may have even better anti-diabetic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meju, unsalted fermented soybeans exhibited better insulin sensitizing and insulinotropic actions than unfermented cooked soybeans (CSB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether meju fermented in the traditional (TMS) manner for 60 days and meju fermented in the standardized (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) method inoculating Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus oryzae for 6 days modulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, insulin secretion, and pancreatic beta-cell growth and survival in 90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats, a moderate and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diabetic rats were divided into 3 groups: 1) TMS (n = 20), 2) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> (n = 20) or 3) casein (control; n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were provided with a high fat diet (40 energy % fat) containing assigned 10% meju for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of experiment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin secretion capacity were measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and by hyperglycemic clamp, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, beta-cell mass and islet morphohometry were determined by immunohistochemistry and insulin signaling in the liver was measured by western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TMS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50753">isoflavonoid</z:chebi> aglycones much more than CSB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSB and TMS/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in diabetic rats but the mechanism was different between treatments (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSB enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity including hepatic insulin sensitivity better than the control but TMS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> enhanced only hepatic insulin sensitivity through activating insulin signaling in diabetic rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, TMS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>, but not CSB, potentiated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion and beta-cell mass (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> had better insulinotropic actions than the control (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The anti-diabetic action of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>, especially when fermented with Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus oryzae, was superior to CSB by increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50753">isoflavonoid</z:chebi> aglycones and small <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with regard to type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
