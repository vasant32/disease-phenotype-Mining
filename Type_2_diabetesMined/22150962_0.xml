<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of 101 insulin-naive patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed self-administered questionnaires including demographic and clinical characteristics, the Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale and the Center for Epidemiological Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Psychological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was denoted by negative appraisal of insulin (Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine per cent of the sample were unwilling to accept insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unwilling participants perceived taking insulin more often as a failure to control their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with tablets or lifestyle compared with willing participants (59 vs. 33%), unwilling participants were more reluctant to accept the responsibilities of everyday management of insulin therapy (49 vs. 24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and objection to lifelong insulin therapy were independently associated with psychological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study in primary care, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and objection to lifelong insulin therapy are associated with psychological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the objection to the indefiniteness of insulin therapy showed a sense of limitation of daily life and loss of independence that should not be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin should be offered as a means to improve health as this might facilitate the acceptance of insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
