<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Background: Lack of self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) records in actual practice settings continues to create therapeutic challenges for clinicians, especially in adjusting insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to overcome this clinical obstacle, a "Symptom-based Insulin adjustment for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> Normalization" (SIGN) algorithm was developed to guide clinicians in caring for patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who have few to no SMBG records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the clinical outcome and safety of the SIGN algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects and Methods: Glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), insulin usage, and insulin-related adverse effects of a total of 114 patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who refused to use SMBG or performed SMBG once a day for less than three times per week were studied 3 months prior to the implementation of the algorithm and prospectively at every 3-month interval for a total of 6 months after the algorithm implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, nonadherence to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications, or who were not on insulin therapy at any time during the study period were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Mean HbA1c improved by 0.29% at 3 months (P=0.015) and 0.41% at 6 months (P=0.006) after algorithm implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A slight increase in HbA1c was observed when the algorithm was not implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> was minimal with the majority of the cases due to irregular meal habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The SIGN algorithm appeared to offer a viable and safe approach when managing uncontrolled patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who have few to no SMBG records </plain></SENT>
