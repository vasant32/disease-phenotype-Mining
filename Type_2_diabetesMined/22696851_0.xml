<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed on 261 type 2 diabetic patients at Chandrubeksa Hospital on January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent fundus examination by ophthalmologists using indirect ophthalmoscope to check for any signs of DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was presented in 67 (25.70%) patients who were categorized into non-proliferative and proliferative types, 23.4% and 2.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients who received insulin treatment were more likely to have DR than those who had not (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.86, 8.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those who had had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for more than 5 years were more likely to have diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> than those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for a lesser amount of time (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.28, 4.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Insulin treatment and the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are the significant associated factors for developing diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors emphasize the necessity of regular eye check-ups which can provide the patients with early detection so that treatment can begin before much damage occurs </plain></SENT>
