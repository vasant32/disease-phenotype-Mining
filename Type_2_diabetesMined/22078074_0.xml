<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study we have evaluated the induction of micronuclei due to increased glycosylation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-nine subjects divided into two groups of normoglycemic controls and type 2 diabetic cases were recruited in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole blood was cultured and micronuclei were scored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was correlated with age, sex, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age and sex matched diabetic patients had an increased micronuclei frequency in response to elevated glycosylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (R(2)=0.229, p=0.037) compared to normoglycemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increased glycosylation seems to induce oxidative damage in the DNA of the diabetic patients, which manifests as an increased micronuclei frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has a potential to be used as a biomarker for subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
