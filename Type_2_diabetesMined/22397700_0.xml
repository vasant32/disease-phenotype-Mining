<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified during the index period of 2003-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were ≥ 30 years old at the date of the first observed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis (referred to as index date) and had at least 2 years of follow-up medical history (N = 9,158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initiation of antihyperglycaemic medication (i.e., treatment) was assessed in the 2-year period following the index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusted Cox regression models were used to examine the association between time to medication initiation and patient age and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (SD) HbA1c at diagnosis was 8.1% (2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 51% of patients initiated antihyperglycaemic medication within 2 years (65%, 55%, 46% and 40% for patients in the 30- &lt; 45, 45- &lt; 65, 65- &lt; 75, 75+ age groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the treated patients, median (25th, 75th percentile) time to treatment initiation was 63 (8, 257) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% at diagnosis, 87% initiated treatment within 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients with a higher HbA1c also had shorter time to treatment initiation (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.44 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.61, 3.70]; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing age (in years) was negatively associated with time to treatment initiation (HR = 0.98 [95% CI: 0.97, 0.99]; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly associated with shorter time to treatment initiation included female gender and use of cardiovascular medications at baseline or initiated during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this UK cohort of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, only 51% had antihyperglycaemic medication initiated over a 2-year period following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Older patients were significantly less likely to have been prescribed antihyperglycaemic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Elevated HbA1c was the strongest factor associated with initiating antihyperglycaemic medication in these patients </plain></SENT>
