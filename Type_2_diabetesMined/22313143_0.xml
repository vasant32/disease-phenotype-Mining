<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with serious complications and shortens life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its prevalence is increasing rapidly worldwide and no cure is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One logical response is to diagnose the condition as early as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical opportunistic screening is one mechanism for making the diagnosis before symptoms are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper reports the cost of using this technique in UK general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In one UK general practice, the electronic medical records were searched to determine the number of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests undertaken for non-pregnant adults without known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over three consecutive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The laboratory, staff and administrative costs associated with these screening tests were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients newly diagnosed with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the same period were reviewed to identify diagnoses made by clinical opportunistic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total costs were divided by the number of diagnoses to determine a cost per diagnosis detected by opportunistic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 5720 screening tests were conducted for 2763 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the 3 years, 86 patients were diagnosed with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 54 (63%) via screening (yield 2.0%; number needed to screen 51.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The screening costs totalled £ 20,372 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average cost per new screen-detected diagnosis was £ 377 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Almost two-thirds of new cases of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be detected before symptoms are reported, at reasonable cost by opportunistic screening in general practice, without the use of extra resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As an affordable alternative to population screening, clinical opportunistic screening merits further consideration </plain></SENT>
