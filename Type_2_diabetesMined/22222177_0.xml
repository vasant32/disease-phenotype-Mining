<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of exercise on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis include a marked stimulation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization during and after its performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a program of 3 physical therapy modalities on blood circulation in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHOD:: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with Leriche-Fontaine stage I or IIa <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to an exercise or placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 20 weeks, the exercise group underwent treatment comprising 3 exercises at proximal, medium, and distal segments of the lower limbs, and the placebo group received sham treatment with disconnected ultrasound equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>Peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> was determined by evaluating the ankle/brachial index (ABI), Doppler flow velocity, blood parameters, cardiovascular risk score, and heart rate during exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: After 20 weeks of treatment, significant differences between groups were found in the following: right (P &lt; .039) and left (P &lt; .023) ABI; Doppler flow velocity (cm/s) in the right (P &lt; .010) and left (P &lt; .026) posterior tibial artery and in the right (P &lt; .012) and left (P &lt; .022) dorsalis pedis artery; and fibrinogen (P &lt; .045), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (P &lt; .021), cholesterol (P &lt; .012), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (P &lt; .031), and HbA1c (P &lt; .034) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> values (P &lt; .110) between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: A program of these physical therapy modalities improves ABI, Doppler flow velocity, and blood parameters in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
