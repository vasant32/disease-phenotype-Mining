<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have identified nearly 40 different type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility loci, mainly in European populations, but few of them have been evaluated in the Mexican population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which 24 common genetic variants previously associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated in Mexican Mestizos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near genes (KCNJ11, PPARG, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A/2B, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, ARHGEF11, JAZF1, CDC123/CAMK1D, FTO, TSPAN8/LGR5, KCNQ1, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2, NXPH1, RORA, UBQLNL, and RALGPS2) were genotyped in Mexican Mestizos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case-control association study comprising 1,027 type 2 diabetic individuals and 990 control individuals was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To account for population stratification, a panel of 104 ancestry-informative markers was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found for rs13266634 (SLC30A8), rs7923837 (HHEX), rs10811661 (CDKN2A/2B), rs4402960 (IGF2BP2), rs12779790 (CDC123/CAMK1D), and rs2237892 (KCNQ1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, rs7754840 (CDKAL1) was associated in the nonobese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subgroup, and for rs7903146 (TCF7L2), association was observed for early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lack of association for the rest of the variants may have resulted from insufficient power to detect smaller allele effects </plain></SENT>
