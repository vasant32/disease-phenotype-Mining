<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In thus study, the correlations between HbA1c levels and metabolic control (average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, AG), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability (SD, CONGA, MAGE, MODD, BG ROC), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (HBGI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (LBGI) and postprandial (AUC PP) indices were investigated in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study involved 68 patients divided into 3 groups as follows: 35 patients had type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (group 1); 17 had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and were taking multiple daily injections (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>) of insulin (group 2); and 16 patients had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with OHA and/or basal insulin (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The indicators were obtained over at least 48 h using a continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels were measured at the baseline and after CGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA1c correlated significantly with AG (r = 0.74), AUC PP (r = 0.69) and HBGI (r = 0.74), but only in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with longstanding disease and type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a greater <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability, irrespective of their HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> correlated strongly with HbA1c, but not with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels identify states of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and seem to be unaffected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> or short-lived <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> spikes, consequently revealing shortcomings as a "gold standard" indicator of metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> variability indicators describe the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile of type 1 diabetic patients and identify any worsening glycemic control (typical of longstanding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) more accurately than HbA1c tests </plain></SENT>
