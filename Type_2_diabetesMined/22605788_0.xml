<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The OPTIMISE (OPtimal Type 2 dIabetes Management Including benchmarking and Standard trEatment) trial comparing physicians' individual performances with a peer group evaluates the hypothesis that benchmarking, using assessments of change in three critical quality indicators of vascular risk: glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) and systolic blood pressure (SBP), may improve quality of care in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the primary care setting.Design: This was a randomised, controlled study of 3980 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.Methods: Six European countries participated in the OPTIMISE study (NCT00681850) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quality of care was assessed by the percentage of patients achieving pre-set targets for the three critical quality indicators over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians were randomly assigned to receive either benchmarked or non-benchmarked feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> physicians received feedback on six of their patients' modifiable outcome indicators (HbA(1c), fasting glycaemia, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physicians in the benchmarking group additionally received information on levels of control achieved for the three critical quality indicators compared with colleagues.Results: At baseline, the percentage of evaluable patients (N = 3980) achieving pre-set targets was 51.2% (HbA(1c); n = 2028/3964); 34.9% (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>; n = 1350/3865); 27.3% (systolic blood pressure; n = 911/3337).Conclusions: OPTIMISE confirms that target achievement in the primary care setting is suboptimal for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three critical quality indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This represents an unmet but modifiable need to revisit the mechanisms and management of improving care in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OPTIMISE will help to assess whether benchmarking is a useful clinical tool for improving outcomes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
