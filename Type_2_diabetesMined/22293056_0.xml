<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty years ago type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was very rare in Greenland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent epidemiological studies have found a high prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Greenlanders comparable to levels among Inuit populations in Canada and Alaska </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2008 a national <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> programme was implemented aiming to improve the care for patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Greenland based on a donation from Novo Nordisk A/S to the national health care service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> concept based on national guidelines, systematized recording in an electronically medical record and feedback to the clinics were used to improve the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate if implementation of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> programme in Greenland would have a measurable effect on the quality in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care including diagnostic activity and screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two observational and cross sectional studies were performed in Greenland 2008 and 2010 before and after implementation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The medical records of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was estimated using the whole adult population in Greenland as background population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The quality of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care was monitored by 12 health care indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of diagnosed cases with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> among Greenlanders has increased over a period of two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the same period a significant increase in the quality of care in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Greenland has been documented concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> process-of-care indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significantly regional variation in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care was demonstrated in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The quality in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care was best in clinics with a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 2010 a more homogenate quality among the clinics in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These effects could be a result of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> programme implanted in between the two observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, improved quality in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care along with an increasing prevalence of diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> has been documented after implementation of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is strongly recommended to maintain focus on the quality on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in order to benefit from the programme in a long-term perspective </plain></SENT>
