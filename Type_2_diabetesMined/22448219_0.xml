<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wished to examine to which extent treatments considered relevant by caregivers in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are covered by Cochrane systematic reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 130 different interventions in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified based on a review of clinical practice guidelines and expert opinion (Table S1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>459 members of the German <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Society (diabetologists, general practitioners, diabetic nurses, nutritionists, podologists, others) were surveyed via e-mail-list to rank a) the perceived clinical relevance and b) the perceived need for evidence of interventions, based on an internet survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Cochrane Library, there were, at the time of this evaluation, 56 reviews on interventions in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Generally, coverage of topics by Cochrane reviews reflected the perceived clinical relevance and perceived need for evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As an example, highly ranked treatments such as lifestyle changes or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetics</z:chebi> were well covered, while low rank treatments such as complementary approaches were not covered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies occurred with new treatments such as amylin-analogues (low relevance, high need for evidence, review not yet completed) and interventions with immediate and dramatic effects such as treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (high relevance, low need for evidence, no review) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, there was a relative scarcity of reviews concerning specific problems, in particular, treatment of late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: For most interventions, perceived relevance and perceived need for evidence are reflected by the evidence already available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prioritizing should aim at improving immediacy and consideration of the treatment of complications </plain></SENT>
