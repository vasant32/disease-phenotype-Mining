<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Micro <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> may function in networks, forming a complex relationship with diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alterations of specific miRNA levels have significant correlation with diseases of divergent origin, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) has an increasing worldwide epidemic with serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, T2DM is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> process, and from early metabolic alterations to manifest complications decades may pass, during which our diagnostic arsenal is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Micro <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> may thus serve as novel diagnostic tools as well as therapeutic targets in pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent Fundings: Micro <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (miRNAs) involved in inflammatory processes contributing to the development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) published mostly in the past 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs are involved in such early diabetic processes as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400966" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-alcoholic steatohepatitis</z:e> (NASH) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the visceral adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence is emerging regarding the continuous spectrum between type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1DM) and T2DM being just 2 endpoints of the same disease with different genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, miRNA regulation of autoimmune components in T2DM may shed new light on pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the involvement of miRNAs in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as a key driving force of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> is also summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> is emerging as a central pathophysiological process in the development of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visceral adipose tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400966" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-alcoholic steatohepatitis</z:e> together with <z:mp ids='MP_0004031'>insulitis</z:mp> are probably the first events leading to a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These early events may be diagnosed or even influenced through our increasing knowledge about the involvement of post-transcriptional gene regulation by miRNAs </plain></SENT>
