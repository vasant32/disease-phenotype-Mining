<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Podocyte specific proteins are dysregulated in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, though the extent of their expression loss is not identical and may be subject to different regulatory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantifying the degree of loss may help identify the most useful protein to use as an early biomarker of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Protein expression of synaptopodin, podocin and nephrin were quantified in 15 Type 2 diabetic renal biopsies and 12 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found statistically significant downregulation of synaptopodin (P&lt;0.0001), podocin (P = 0.0002), and nephrin (P&lt;0.0001) in kidney biopsies of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urinary nephrin levels (nephrinuria) were then measured in 66 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 10 healthy controls by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Exocell, Philadelphia, PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When divided into groups according to normo-, micro-, and macroalbuminuria, nephrinuria was found to be present in 100% of diabetic patients with micro- and macroalbuminuria, as well as 54% of patients with normoalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nephrinuria also correlated significantly with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (rho = 0.89, p&lt;0.001), systolic blood pressure (rho = 0.32, p = 0.007), and correlated negatively with serum albumin (rho = -0.48, p&lt;0.0001) and eGFR (rho = -0.33, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that key podocyte-specific protein expressions are significantly and differentially downregulated in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The finding that nephrinuria is observed in a majority of these normoalbuminuric patients demonstrates that it may precede <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If further research confirms nephrinuria to be a biomarker of pre-clinical diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, it would shed light on podocyte metabolism in disease, and raise the possibility of new and earlier therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
