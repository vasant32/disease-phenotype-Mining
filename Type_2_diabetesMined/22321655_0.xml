<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetics on BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was determined using the homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen type 2 diabetic patients with a HOMA-IR &lt;2.7 (mean age, 51.5±9.6yr; body mass index [BMI], 27.3±5.1kg/m(2); duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 10.5±7.3yr) were included in Group A, and 30 BMI- and age-matched type 2 diabetic patients with a HOMA-IR ≥2.7 were included in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BMD was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent t-test was used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Group A values for mean fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels were 160.1±77.0mg/dL and 4.79±2.89μU/L, respectively, whereas the Group B values were 195.1±58.9mg/dL (p&gt;0.05) and 19.30±16.89μU/L (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher total lumbar vertebra T-score (p=0.02) and total lumbar vertebra BMD in Group A were determined than Group B (p=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lumbar vertebra total Z-score was significantly lower in Group B (p=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may have a negative effect on BMD in type 2 diabetics, while the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> may be associated with the low BMD </plain></SENT>
