<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Japanese-Brazilian population has one of the highest prevalence rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess whether two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2, rs7903146 and rs12255372, could predict the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in Japanese-Brazilians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a population-based 7-year prospective study, we genotyped 222 individuals (72 males and 150 females, aged 56.2 Â± 10.5 years) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the study population, we found that the minor allele frequency was 0.05 for SNP rs7903146 and 0.03 for SNP rs12255372 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant allele or genotype association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> incidence was found for either SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes were constructed with these two SNPs and three haplotypes were defined: CG (frequency: 0.94), TT (frequency = 0.027) and TG (frequency = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the haplotypes provided evidence for association with the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite no associations between incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and SNPs of the TCF7L2 gene in Japanese-Brazilians, we found that carriers of the CT genotype for rs7903146 had significantly lower insulin levels 2 h after a 75-g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load than carriers of the CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in Japanese-Brazilians, a population with a high prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, common TCF7L2 variants did not make major contributions to the incidence of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance abnormalities </plain></SENT>
