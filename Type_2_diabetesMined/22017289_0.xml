<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, the relationship of the -786T/C, the VNTR intron 4 a/b and the 894G/T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms in the eNOS gene with the presence or severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was analyzed in 630 Caucasian-Brazilians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (434 with and 196 without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of eNOS polymorphisms was carried out using the PCR or PCR-RFLP method, and haplotype frequencies were estimated using a Bayesian method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotype and allele frequencies in patients with any degree of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were not significantly different from those of patients without this complication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eNOS polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, there were no differences in haplotype frequencies among diabetic patients with or without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (p values &gt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the -786T/C, the VNTR intron 4 a/b and the 894G/T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms in the eNOS gene play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
