<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we analyze the biological relevance of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> in diabetogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As has recently been demonstrated, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> decreases insulin secretion via specific <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptor isoforms (MT1 and MT2) in the pancreatic β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, type 2 diabetic rats, as well as patients, exhibit decreased <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> levels, whereas the levels in type 1 diabetic rats are increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter effects were normalized by insulin substitution, which signifies that a specific receptor-mediated insulin-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> antagonism exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are in agreement with several recent genome-wide association studies, which have identified a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the MTNR1B gene, encoding the MT2 receptor, that were closely associated with a higher prognostic risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, which decrease insulin levels and stimulate <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> synthesis, control insulin-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results support this assertion as we show that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> are increased in type 1 but are diminished in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another important line of inquiry involves the fact that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> protects the β-cells against functional overcharge and, consequently, hinders the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this context, it is striking that at advanced ages, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> levels are reduced and the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> appears to have a protective biological role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here, we strongly repudiate misconceptions, resulting from observations that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> reduces the plasma insulin level, that the blockage of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptors would be of benefit in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
