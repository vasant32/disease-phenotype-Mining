<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of PC on WT1 expression in glomerular podocytes and the mechanism of PC on early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic rats have been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic rats were generated by high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ), then fed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (0.4 mg/kg), low-dose (60 mg/kg) or high-dose (120 mg/kg) of PC once a day for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) was examined regularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin (INS) was measured by a radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> (mALB) was measured by an ELISA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (UCr), blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN) and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-Î²-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) were measured by colorimetric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Renal morphological changes were observed by optical microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> 1 (WT1EI) in glomeruli was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed that PC led to a decrease in FBG (p &lt; 0.01), NAG (p &lt; 0.05) and mALB (p &lt; 0.05) and an increase in INS (p &lt; 0.01) and WT1EI (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PC could improve renal damage and greatly reduce the renal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> score (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that PC had the protective effect on early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic rats, which was closely related to the regulation of podocytes </plain></SENT>
