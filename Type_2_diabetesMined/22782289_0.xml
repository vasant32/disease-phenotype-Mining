<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that a genotype score predicts incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from young adulthood and improves <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prediction models based on clinical risk factors alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study followed young adults (aged 18-30 years, mean age 25) serially into middle adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used Cox regression to build nested prediction models for incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on clinical risk factors assessed in young adulthood (age, sex, race, parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BMI, mean arterial pressure, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and triacylglyercol), without and with a 38-variant genotype score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Models were compared with C statistics and continuous net reclassification improvement indices (NRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2,439 participants, 830 (34%) were black and 249 (10%) had a BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a mean 23.9 years of follow-up, 215 (8.8%) participants developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genotype score significantly predicted incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> models, with an HR of 1.08 per risk allele (95% CI 1.04, 1.13) in the full model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of the score to the full model modestly improved reclassification (continuous NRI 0.285; 95% CI 0.126, 0.433) but not discrimination (C statistics 0.824 and 0.829 in full models with and without score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Race-stratified analyses were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Knowledge of genotype predicts type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 25 years in white and black young adults but may not improve prediction over routine clinical measurements </plain></SENT>
