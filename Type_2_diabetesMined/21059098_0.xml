<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>POU2F1 is located on chromosome 1q24, a region with linkage for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese and other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of POU2F1 genetic variants with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Hong Kong Chinese using two independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped five haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms at POU2F1 in 1378 clinic-based patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 601 control subjects, as well as 707 members from 179 families with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found significant associations of rs4657652, rs7532692, rs10918682 and rs3767434 (OR = 1.26-1.59, 0.0003 &lt; P(unadjusted) &lt; 0.035) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the clinic-based case-control cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rs3767434 was also associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 1.55, P(unadjusted) = 0.013) in the family-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis revealed similar associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the risk G allele of rs10918682 showed increased usage of insulin treatment during a mean follow-up period of 7 years [hazard ratio = 1.50 (1.05-2.14), P = 0.025] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using separate cohorts, we observed consistent results showing the contribution of multiple variants at POU2F1 to the risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
