<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a few studies have reported the association between proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) and the serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1 (apoA1), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (apoB) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So we investigated the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in type 2 diabetic patients of long duration with very mild nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NPDR) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 25 type 2 diabetic patients with very mild NPDR and 25 type 2 diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>, and the two groups were matched by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, apoA1, apoB, and apoE were measured by enzymatic colorimetric, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi>, and immunotubidimetric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> subjects, very mild NPDR subjects were characterized by increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.0433) and apoA1 (P = 0.0290) levels, higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.0377) and apoA1/apoB (P = 0.0061) ratio in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant associations between the decreased apoA1 and low apoA1/apoB ratio in serum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even after adjustment for age, decreased apoA1 level (P = 0.0304) and low apoA1/apoB ratio (P = 0.0218) in serum were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients of over 15 years' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B ratio in serum was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients of long duration </plain></SENT>
