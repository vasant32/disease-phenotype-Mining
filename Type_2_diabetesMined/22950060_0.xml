<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred eleven patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were measured, and the visceral fat area was assessed using computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAN was diagnosed using a cardiovascular reflex test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the correlation between the visceral fat area and each parameter in this test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age, body mass index (BMI), and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of the study population were 60±14 years (mean±standard deviation), 25.1±4.2 kg/m(2), and 12.3±8.9 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The visceral fat area showed positive correlations with age, BMI, waist circumference, and subcutaneous fat area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the cardiovascular reflex test outcome between genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate linear regression analysis showed that an increased visceral fat area diminished good heart rate response to a Valsalva maneuver (R(2)=4.9%, P=0.013 in an unadjusted model), but only in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This statistical association was preserved after adjusting for age and BMI (R(2)=9.8%, P=0.0072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> contributes to an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> to some degree, as demonstrated by the impaired cardiovascular reflex test among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
