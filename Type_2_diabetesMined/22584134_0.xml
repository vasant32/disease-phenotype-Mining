<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that intensive (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;120 mmHg) rather than standard (SBP 130-139 mmHg) blood pressure (BP) control improves health-related quality of life (HRQL) in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were 1,028 ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) BP trial HRQL substudy participants who completed baseline and one or more 12-, 36-, or 48-month HRQL evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariable linear regression assessed impact of BP treatment assignment on change in HRQL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 4.0 years of follow-up, no significant differences occurred in five of six HRQL measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those assigned to intensive (vs. standard) BP control had statistically significant worsening of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey (SF36) physical component scores (-0.8 vs. -0.2; P = 0.02), but magnitude of change was not clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings persisted across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prespecified subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive BP control in the ACCORD trial did not have a clinically significant impact, either positive or negative, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or patient-reported HRQL </plain></SENT>
