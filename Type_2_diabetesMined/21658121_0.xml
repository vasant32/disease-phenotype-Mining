<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate whether a reduced incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be achieved in a newly recruited cohort following the recently advanced concept of multifactorial treatment and followed in primary care settings as compared with earlier cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study was performed in primary care settings at multiple clinics nationwide in the Japan <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Clinical Data Management (JDDM) study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 2984 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was the first event of non-fatal or fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or peripheral artery disease, and the incidence was compared with other representative cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 90 cardiovascular events over 10,827 person-years of follow-up with a dropout rate of 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidences (per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval) of composite, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and peripheral artery disease in the JDDM study were 8.3 (6.6-10.0), 4.4 (3.2-5.6), 3.1 (2.1-4.2), and 0.7 (0.2-1.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each incidence was lowest in the JDDM study compared with other cohorts (P &lt; 0.01 vs. each cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the JDDM study, significant variables predictive of the occurrence of a cardiovascular event were age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and urinary albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The novel finding of low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> occurrence in this study may be conferred by the feasibility at primary care settings for providing patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with favourable control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, coupled with unique ethnicity/country factors </plain></SENT>
