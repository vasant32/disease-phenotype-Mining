<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We analysed the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study data in order to evaluate how the new HbA(1c) -based criterion compares with the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in diagnosing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among high-risk individuals during a prospective average follow-up of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study, 172 men and 350 women who were overweight and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> at baseline were randomized into an intensive lifestyle intervention or a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and HbA(1c) measurements were performed annually until the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the World Health Organization 1985 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity of the HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol) as a diagnostic criterion for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 35% (95% CI 24%, 47%) in women and 47% (95% CI 31%, 64%) in men compared with diagnosis based on two consecutive oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding sensitivities for HbA(1c) ≥ 6.0% (≥ 42 mmol/mol) were 67% (95% CI 55%, 77%) and 68% (95% CI 51%, 82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The participants with HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations than those who had a diabetic oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test but HbA(1c) &lt; 6.5% (&lt; 48 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the predictive performance of baseline fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and HbA(1c)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis based on two oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests during the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study follow-up, 60% would have remained undiagnosed if diagnosis had been based on HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol) criterion </plain></SENT>
