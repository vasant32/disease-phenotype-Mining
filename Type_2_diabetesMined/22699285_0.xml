<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of aortic valve <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (AVS) and mitral annulus calcification (MAC) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 902 type 2 diabetic outpatients, who had undergone a transthoracic echocardiography for clinical reasons during the years 1992-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AVS and MAC were diagnosed by echocardiography, and a heart valve calcium (HVC) score was calculated by summing up the AVS and MAC variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 477 (52.9%) patients had no heart valves affected (HVC-0), 304 (33.7%) had one valve affected (HVC-1), and 121 (13.4%) had both valves affected (HVC-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 9 years, 137 (15.2%) patients died, 78 of them from cardiovascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with HVC-0, those with HVC-2 had the highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality, whereas those with HVC-1 had an intermediate risk (P &lt; 0.0001 by the log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for sex, age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, A1C, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, estimated glomerular filtration rate, smoking, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs, the hazard ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was 2.3 (95% CI 1.1-4.9; P &lt; 0.01) for patients with HVC-1 and 9.3 (3.9-17.4; P &lt; 0.001) for those with HVC-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found for cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that AVS and MAC, singly or in combination, are independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
