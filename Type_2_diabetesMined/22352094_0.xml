<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A descriptive - correlation study was performed for a period of four months in 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study population was type 2 diabetic patients referred to Omolbanin, Diabetic Center in Isfahan, cultural capital of Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hundred and sixty diabetic patients met the inclusion criteria and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient's empowerment was measured by DES (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Empowerment Scale) self-report scale with subscales reflecting three areas including Managing the psychosocial aspect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (9 items), Assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to change (9 items) and Setting and achieving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> goal (10 items) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collected data was analyzed by using SPSS software version 11.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants were between the ages of 38 and 78 with a mean of 48.67 +/- 7.99 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 49.4% males, 87.5% were married, and 44.9% had education of diploma and higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 5.62 +/- 3.81 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 46.9% participants had borderline metabolic control according to World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Empowerment Scale, three conceptual domains of 'Managing the psychosocial aspect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>', 'Assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to change' and 'Setting and achieving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> goal' were measured and scored for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average score of each domain was 27.15 +/- 8.20), (29.03 +/- 10.40), (31.95 +/- 11.70) respectively. 'Setting and achieving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> goal' was considered as the most important domain in measuring <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> empowerment level showed a significant relationship between variables such as educational level (p&lt;0.001), gender (0.007), age (p&lt;0.001), and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlation coefficient also revealed that empowerment of type 2 diabetic patients has a reverse relationship with HbA1c (r = - 0.75, p 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ordinal regression test revealed that having diploma and higher education (p=0.005), and optimal and borderline HbA1c (p&lt;0.001) were effective factors in empowering diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Empowerment is psychosocial self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Healthcare professionals and researches have introduced 'self-empowerment' as a key element in managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When it comes to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, empowerment implies an approach that attempts to enhance the ability of patients to actively understand and influence their own lives and health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It seems that patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be empowered to manage their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease if they are actively informed and educated </plain></SENT>
