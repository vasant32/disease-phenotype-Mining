<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To review clinical and experimental data for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> as a possible systemic treatment for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of clinical studies focused on 2 major randomized controlled trials: the FIELD (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> Intervention and Event Lowering in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>)-Eye studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression was defined in FIELD as laser treatment for proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> or increase by ≥ 2 steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study (ETDRS) scale, and in ACCORD-Eye as ≥ 3 steps (ETDRS scale) or proliferative disease requiring laser or vitrectomy treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies investigating the mode of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 trials included 11 388 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, of whom 5701 were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> (± <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>) for up to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> reduced first laser treatment by 31% (P = .0002), and progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> with absolute reductions of 5.0% over 5 years (P = .022, FIELD) and 3.7% over 4 years (P = .006, ACCORD-Eye) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was greater benefit in patients with than without preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The putative mechanisms implicated in the mode of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> involve <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and nonlipid pathways, including beneficial effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, blood-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> barrier breakdown, and neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are now robust and consistent clinical data to recommend <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> as an adjunctive treatment for early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, taking into account the risks vs benefits of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further elucidating its mode of action will help to refine how best to use <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> in the management of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
