<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five physicians enrolled 103 patients ≥ 40 years old with uncontrolled Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [HbA(1c) ≥ 64 mmol/mol (8.0%)] to randomly receive either a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> scorecard or not during four clinical visits over a 9-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The population was predominantly urban with a disproportionately higher percentage of black people than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our scorecard assigned points to six clinical variables, with a perfect total score of 100 points corresponding to meeting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes were total scores and HbA(1c) in the scorecard and control groups at 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the control and scorecard groups at visits 1 and 4 in total score, HbA(1c) , blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, aspirin usage, exercise or knowledge about diabetic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By visit 4 both the control and scorecard groups had statistically significant improvements with their mean total score (9 and 7 points, respectively), HbA(1c) [-9 mmol/mol (-0.8%) and -15 mmol/mol (-1.4%), respectively] and aspirin usage (33% increase and 16% increase, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rates of clinical inertia were low throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> scorecard did not improve glycaemic control, blood pressure control, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, aspirin usage, exercise or diabetic knowledge in an urban population with uncontrolled Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
