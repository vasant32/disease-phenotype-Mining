<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, adherence to prescribed medications has been reported to be as low as 60%, meaning that many patients may not be following the treatment plan that has been prescribed for them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of treatment adherence is intuitive: better adherence would promote better outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data show this to be the case: for every 25% increase in medication adherence, a patient's glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1C) is reduced by 0.34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, only a little more than half of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> achieve an A1C target below 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poor therapeutic adherence affects <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who are nonadherent are far more likely to require hospitalization and to incur significantly higher healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesser costs of lower medication utilization in nonadherent patients are more than compensated for by the increased costs arising from poorer glycemic control, as multiple studies employing large managed care databases have demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvements in outcomes and reductions in costs related to the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> require focused efforts toward facilitating treatment adherence, efforts that should be undertaken by third-party payers in addition to physicians and patients </plain></SENT>
