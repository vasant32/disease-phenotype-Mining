<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate a potential association between SNP rs10494366 in the neural nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase adaptor protein (NOS1AP) and efficacy of repaglinide (an insulin secretagogue) in newly diagnosed Shanghai Chinese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 104 newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (69 men, 35 women) were recruited and treated with repaglinide for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements, clinical laboratory tests were obtained at baseline and after 24-week treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The baseline value of BMI, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, and fasting insulin level were significantly different between GG, GT, and TT genotypes (P=0.024, 0.030, 0.005, and 0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carriers of TT genotype were in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24-week repaglinide monotherapy, the Delta value of fasting insulin (P=0.019) and HOMA-IR (P=0.011) were significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TT carriers had the least <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mixed model analysis showed that the variation had an interaction effect with repaglinide treatment only on HOMA-IR (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A common variant in rs10494366 is associated with repaglinide monotherapy efficacy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in newly diagnosed Shanghai Chinese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
