<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no studies to date that investigate whether cinnamon supplements are able to aid in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized cinnamon should be effective in improving blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this hypothesis, we performed a randomized, double-blinded clinical study to analyze the effect of cinnamon extract on glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 66 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups: placebo and low-dose and high-dose supplementation with cinnamon extract at 120 and 360 mg/d, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> during the entire 3 months of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly reduced in patients in the low- and high-dose groups, whereas they were not changed in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were also significantly reduced in the low-dose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The blood levels of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and liver transaminase remained unchanged in the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study indicates that cinnamon supplementation is able to significantly improve blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
