<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At this time, there is no objective test for diagnosing PDN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we measured the peptidergic intraepidermal nerve fiber densities (IENFD) from hind paws of the db/db mouse, an animal model for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, during the period of mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> from 6 to 12 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of the hind footpads were identified by protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peptidergic IENF were determined by double immunofluorescence using anti-PGP9.5 and antibodies against tropomyosin-receptor-kinase (Trk) A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant increase in PGP9.5-positive IENFD at 8 and 10 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Trk A-positive peptidergic IENF, which also express substance P and calcitonin gene related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in db/db mice, were observed to be elevated from 1.5 to 2 fold over controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This upregulation ended at 16 weeks of age, in accordance with the reduction of mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-NGF treatment significantly inhibited the upregulation of peptidergic IENFD during the period of mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp>, suggesting that increased neurotrophism may mediate this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38, blocked the increase in peptidergic IENFD in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current results suggest that peptidergic IENFD could be a potential diagnostic indicator for PDN in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the inhibition of NGF-p38 signaling could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating this painful condition </plain></SENT>
