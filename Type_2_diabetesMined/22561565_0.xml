<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 248 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 10 communities of Changsha were randomized into intervention or control groups in February 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention group received systematic self-management education, while the other received routine community education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after intervention, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2 h postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> were measured, and evaluated between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2 h postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the two groups were generally comparable at baseline (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the intervention, these three indicators were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> statistically significant between the 2 groups (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After intervention, blood sugar levels in the intervention group were obviously improved (P&lt;0.01), while in the control group, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was not statistically improved (P&gt;0.05), 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were improved (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Systematic self-management education effectively encourages patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to control their blood sugar levels, and deserves further promotion </plain></SENT>
