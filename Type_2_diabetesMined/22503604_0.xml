<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is evidence that diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (PNP) is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004349'>reduced bone mineral density</z:hpo> (BMD) in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but little is known about the impact of diabetic PNP on bone metabolism in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in bone metabolism by measuring markers of bone turnover and BMD in men and postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic PNP compared with those without PNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gender differences were analyzed for both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 68 without PNP (43 men, 25 women, mean age 62 [8] years) and 52 with PNP (28 men, 24 women, mean age 64 [8] years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters with bone turnover biomarkers such as osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide, and carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to evaluate BMD was performed in a subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for age, body mass index, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, homeostasis model assessment index for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, serum C-reactive protein, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, calcium, gamma-glutamyltransferase, parathyroid and sex hormones levels, presence of micro/macrovascular complications, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>- as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related therapies, levels of carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide were significantly higher among patients with PNP when compared with patients without PNP (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in bone biomarkers were more pronounced among men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMD did not differ significantly between patients with and without PNP, independent of gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Male patients with PNP exhibit a higher rate of bone turnover than men without PNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High rate of bone turnover increases the susceptibility for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevention of diabetic PNP might also reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and fractures in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
