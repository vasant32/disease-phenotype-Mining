<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are reports of early evidence that suggest the involvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, substances that have effects in reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> could be potential drugs for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leonurine (4-guanidino-n-butyl syringate; SCM-198) is an <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloid</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (Herba leonuri), which was reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that SCM-198 may have beneficial effects on Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we attempted to test this hypothesis by evaluating the anti-diabetic effect of SCM-198 and the possible underlying mechanisms of its effects in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SCM-198 (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg of body weight, as a positive control) or 1% CMC-Na (<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> carboxymethylcellulose) were administered to the db/db or db/m mice once daily for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3 weeks, SCM-198 (200 mg/kg of body weight) treatment significantly reduced the fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and increased the plasma insulin concentration in the db/db mice, meanwhile it significantly lowered the plasma TAG (triacylglycerol) concentration and increased the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>)-cholesterol concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the dysregulated transcription of the hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic enzymes, including GK (glucokinase), G6Pase (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase) and PEPCK (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase), was recovered by an Akt-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> {such as TNFα (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α), IL (interleukin)-6, IL-1β, degradation of IκB [inhibitor of NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB)] α and thereafter activation of NF-κB} were reversed by SCM-198 treatment in the db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study provides first evidence that SCM-198 exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and has an ameliorating effect on diabetic symptoms via inhibiting of NF-κB/IKK (IκB kinase) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we suggest that SCM-198 may be a prospective agent for prevention and/or moderation of the progress of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
