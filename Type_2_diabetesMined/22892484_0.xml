<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several studies have assessed the efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on peripheral insulin sensitivity using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique in hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these subjects were mostly non-diabetic, and some studies showed that ARB treatment did not improve insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is still uncertain whether ARBs could improve insulin sensitivity in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> on peripheral insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> using M/I value during the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 10 Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who had never taken <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their blood pressure, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, HbA1c and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization rate during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (M/I value) were examined before and after 6 months of treatment with 10-20 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> (mean: 13.0 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood pressure decreased significantly from 156/88 mmHg before starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> to 135/76 mmHg after 6 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean M/I value increased significantly from 6.33 ± 3.19 (mg/kg/min/mU/L) × 100 to 8.11 ± 4.20 (mg/kg/min/mU/L) × 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peripheral insulin sensitivity improved in eight out of ten subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and HbA1c levels also decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism by improving the peripheral insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
