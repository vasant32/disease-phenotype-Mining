<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the U.K., people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are typically screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> sometimes has a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a simulation model to predict the likely impact of screening patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who have not been diagnosed with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, every 2 years rather than annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess whether or not such a policy would increase the proportion of patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> compared with the current policy, along with the potential cost savings that could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a model that simulates the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients, and the screening of these patients, to predict rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We populated the model with data obtained from a National Health Service Foundation Trust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We generated comparative 15-year forecasts to assess the differences between the current and proposed screening policies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The simulation model predicts that implementing a 2-year screening interval for type 2 diabetic patients without evidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> does not increase their risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we predict that this policy could reduce screening costs by ~25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who have not yet developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, every 2 years, rather than annually, is a safe and cost-effective strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings support those of other studies, and we therefore recommend a review of the current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> screening implemented in the U.K </plain></SENT>
