<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study objective was to compare trabecular bone microarchitecture of postmenopausal women with type 2 DM and women without type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An extremity 1T magnetic resonance imaging system was used to acquire axial images (195 × 195 × 1,000 μm(3) voxel size) of the distal radius of women recruited from outpatient clinics or by community advertisement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Image segmentation yielded geometric, topologic, and stereologic outcomes, i.e., number and size of trabecular bone network holes (marrow spaces), endosteal area, trabecular bone volume fraction, nodal and branch density, and apparent trabecular thickness, separation, and number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lumbar spine (LS) and proximal femur BMD were measured with dual x-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microarchitectural differences were assessed using linear regression and adjusted for percent body fat, ethnicity, timed up-and-go test, Charlson Index, and calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake; aBMD differences were adjusted for body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with type 2 DM (n = 30, mean ± SD age 71.0 ± 4.8 years) had larger holes (+13.3%; P = 0.001) within the trabecular bone network than women without type 2 DM (n = 30, mean ± SD age 70.7 ± 4.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LS aBMD was greater in women with type 2 DM; however, after adjustment for BMI, LS aBMD did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In women with type 2 DM, the average hole size within the trabecular bone network at the distal radius is greater compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may explain the elevated fracture risk in this population </plain></SENT>
