<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>29, 1260-1267 (2012) ABSTRACT: Aims  Evaluate dose-dependent effects of once-weekly dulaglutide, a glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 analogue, on glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with lifestyle measures with or without previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods  This 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response trial randomized 167 patients who were anti-hyperglycaemic medication-naïve or had discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy [mean baseline HbA(1c) 59 ± 8 to 61 ± 8 mmol/mol (7.6 ± 0.7 to 7.8 ± 0.8%)] to once-weekly injections of placebo or dulaglutide (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results  A significant dose-dependent reduction in HbA(1c) (least squares mean ± se) was observed across doses (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) reductions in the 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg dulaglutide groups were greater than in the placebo group [-10 ± 1, -11 ± 1 and -11 ± 1 vs. 0 ± 1 mmol/mol (-0.9 ± 0.1, -1.0 ± 0.1 and -1.0 ± 0.1 vs. 0.0 ± 0.1%), respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dose-dependent reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were also observed [least squares mean difference (95% CI) ranging from -0.43 (-1.06 to 0.19) mmol/l for dulaglutide 0.1 mg to -1.87 (-2.56 to -1.19) mmol/l for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dose-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was demonstrated across doses (P = 0.009), but none of the groups were different from placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions  The observed dulaglutide dose-dependent reduction in HbA(1c) and its acceptable safety profile support further clinical development for treatment of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
