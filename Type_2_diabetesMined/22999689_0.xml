<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Little research has been conducted on the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined prevalence, incidence and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the NHS (Nurses' Health Study) and NHS II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> information at study baseline (2000 in NHS and 2001 in NHS II) and 2 followup periods (2002 and 2004 in the NHS, and 2003 and 2005 in the NHS II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> we calculated the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> for 9,994 women with baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> information, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> incidence rates for 4,331 women with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> at baseline and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> information during followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable adjusted odds ratios and relative risks were estimated for associations between possible risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of at least monthly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> was 48% and at least weekly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> was 29% among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the corresponding incidence rates were 9.1 and 3.4 per 100 person-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>White race, higher body mass index, higher parity, lower physical activity, current postmenopausal hormone use and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> use were risk factors for prevalent and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> in this study, and hysterectomy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with increased odds of prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and microvascular complications were associated with a greater risk of frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>Urinary incontinence</z:hpo> was common in this study of women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We identified multiple risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> in these women, several of which suggest ways to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
