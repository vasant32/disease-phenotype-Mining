<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Phosphate homeostasis is connected to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and is influenced by insulin, but the role of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is unknown in this relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the levels of FGF23 and phosphate were investigated during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in healthy and type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of ten type 2 diabetic patients, ten weight-matched <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, and ten healthy lean subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent a 4-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp using physiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> (40 mU/min per m(2)) to determine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for measurement of serum FGF23 and insulin, plasma phosphate and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HbA(1c) were drawn before and after insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The three groups did not differ in baseline levels of serum FGF23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin infusion increased serum FGF23 in the diabetic group (p = 0.009), but not in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in serum FGF23 correlated strongly with increase in insulin levels in the diabetic group (r = 0.83; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the overall group insulin infusion suppressed plasma phosphate concentrations (p = 0.006), but with no differences between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> is under euglycemic conditions followed by a significant increase in serum FGF23 concentrations in diabetic individuals, which correlated with change in insulin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interplay between insulin effects and FGF23 may be important for the understanding of phosphate metabolism in relation to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its vascular complications </plain></SENT>
