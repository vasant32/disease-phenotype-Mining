<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 318 patients (including 128 immigrants) with CHC and advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> attending a tertiary referral clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' medical records were reviewed to collect data describing immigrant status, baseline characteristics, and liver-related clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier (KM) analyses and Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were performed to explore the differences between the two groups with respect to clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to native-born patients, immigrant patients were older, more likely to be female, and more likely to be Asian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immigrants were less likely to be heavy drinkers, heavy smokers, injection drug users, and more likely to have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KM analyses indicated that immigrant patients had a significantly higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) than Canadian-born patients (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate Cox proportional-hazards analyses indicated that immigrant status (hazard ratio (HR) 2.22; P = 0.006), age (HR 1.07; P &lt; 0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy drinking</z:e> (HR 2.69; P = 0.001), heavy smoking (HR 2.03; P = 0.019), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 2.06; P = 0.011) were significantly associated with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analyses showed that immigrant status was not an independent risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> (HR 1.37; P = 0.318) after adjusting for age and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older age and higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> accounted for the increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> among immigrant patients with CHC and advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
