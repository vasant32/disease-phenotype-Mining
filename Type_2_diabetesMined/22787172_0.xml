<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This randomized, crossover clinical trial was conducted on 25 type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study had two trial phases, each for 4 weeks and one washout period for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to consume a diet containing soy milk or a diet containing cow's milk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Soy milk consumption resulted in a significant reduction in d-dimer level (percent change: -3.77 vs. 16.13%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This significant effect remained even after adjusting for confounding factor (carbohydrate intake) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, soy milk consumption had no significant effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î±, interleukin-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and malondialdehyde levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result was near to significance regarding the effect of soy milk consumption on hs-CRP (percent change: -35.45 vs. 36.76%; P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this effect was not significant after adjusting for the confounding variable (carbohydrate intake) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Soy milk consumption could decrease serum d-dimer level among type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> did not change following soy milk intake among these patients </plain></SENT>
