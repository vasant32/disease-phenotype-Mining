<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is among the most nutritious subtropical and tropical vegetables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also used in traditional medicine practices for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Research in animal and human models suggests a possible role of sweet potato in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of sweet potato for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SEARCH METHODS: We searched several electronic databases, among these The Cochrane Library (issue 7, 2011),Â MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SIGLE and LILACS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> up to July 2011), combined with handsearches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No language restriction was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that compared sweet potato with a placebo or a control intervention with or without pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected the trials and extracted the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We evaluated risk of bias using the items randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other potential sources of bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met our inclusion criteria: these investigated a total of 140 participants and ranged from six weeks to five months duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The studies were contributed by the same author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the risk of bias of these trials was unclear or high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> RCTs compared the effect of sweet potato preparations with placebo on the glycaemic control in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant improvement in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) at three to five months with 4 g/day sweet potato preparations compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) -0.3% (95% CI -0.6 to -0.04), P = 0.02; 122 participants, two trials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse effects were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diabetic complications</z:e> and morbidity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause, health-related quality of life, well-being, functional outcomes and costs were not investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend sweet potato for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Improvement in trial methodology as well as addressing the issues of standardization and the quality control of preparations of other varieties of sweet potato are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For medical nutritional therapy, further observational trials and RCTs evaluating the effects of sweet potato are needed to guide any recommendations in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
