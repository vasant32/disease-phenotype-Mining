<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tractography was performed to reconstruct several white matter tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion tensor imaging measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were compared between groups and related to cognitive performance.RESULTSMD was significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tracts in both hemispheres in patients compared with control subjects (P &lt; 0.05), reflecting microstructural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased MD was associated with slowing of information-processing speed and worse memory performance in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but not in the control group after adjustment for age, sex, and estimated IQ (group × MD interaction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of total white matter hyperintensity load and presence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>.CONCLUSIONSIndividuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed microstructural abnormalities in various white matter pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were related to worse cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
