<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous exenatide extended-release (ER; Bydureonâ„¢; also known as exenatide once weekly), a glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, provides a convenient, simple, once-weekly regimen that is approved in adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as adjunctive monotherapy to diet plus exercise (in the US; not as first-line therapy) and/or as combination therapy with specific oral antihyperglycaemic drugs (OADs) in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> despite treatment with these OADs (US and Europe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of exenatide ER in the treatment of adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and gives a brief overview of its pharmacological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In several short-term (24-30 weeks) well designed trials, adjunctive subcutaneously injectable exenatide ER once weekly, as monotherapy or in combination with OADs, significantly improved glycaemic control, bodyweight and some surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk in adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> despite diet and exercise and/or treatment with OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the beneficial effects of adjunctive exenatide ER therapy were sustained in extension studies of up to 3 years of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the intensity of glycaemic control with exenatide ER was generally better than that observed with the exenatide immediate-release formulation (twice daily), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exenatide ER was shown to be noninferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in terms of glycaemic efficacy, but did not meet the criteria for noninferiority versus liraglutide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In treatment-naive patients, exenatide ER treatment did not meet noninferiority criteria versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, whereas in treatment-experienced patients, exenatide ER provided better glycaemic control than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvements in glycaemic control with exenatide ER and, in general, with other antihyperglycaemic agents were reflected in significant improvements from baseline in treatment satisfaction and health-related quality-of-life measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exenatide ER was generally well tolerated in patients participating in these trials, with most treatment-emergent adverse events being of a gastrointestinal nature, of mild to moderate severity, transient and of a similar nature and incidence to those occurring with the exenatide immediate-release formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, exenatide ER is a useful option for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in patients where bodyweight loss is an essential aspect of the individual patient's management </plain></SENT>
