<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of CVE was significantly higher in the subjects with low Calibrated-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> values (&lt;-17.1 dB; n = 42) as compared with those with high values (â‰¥-17.1 dB; n = 43) (P = 0.004, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that both Calibrated-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> value (hazard ratio [HR] 0.802 [95% CI 0.710-0.906]; P &lt; 0.0001) and plaque thickness (1.938 [1.170-3.213]; P = 0.010) were independently associated with CVE, even after adjustment for the 10-year risk for a general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> estimated by Framingham risk scoring (FRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for CVE at 10 years after the baseline examinations revealed that area under the curve for Calibrated-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> was 0.76 (0.60-0.90) and substantially higher than those for plaque thickness (0.60 [0.45-0.79]) and FRS (0.60 [0.40-0.78]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These analyses also revealed that the addition of both plaque thickness and Calibrated-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> value to conventional risk factors significantly improved the event prediction.CONCLUSIONSCalibrated-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> value could improve the risk prediction of CVE in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
