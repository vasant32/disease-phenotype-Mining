<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from 211 Malaysian type 2 diabetic patients (100 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> [DNR], 111 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>) and 165 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high resolution melting assay developed in this study was used to detect SLC2A1 26177A/G polymorphism followed by statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in 26177G minor allele frequency between healthy controls (19.7 %) and total patient group (26.1 %) (p&lt;0.05, Odd ratio=1.437, 95% Confidence interval=1.015-2.035) as well as between healthy controls (19.7 %) and DNR patients (27.5%) (p&lt;0.05, Odd ratio=1.546, 95% Confidence interval=1.024-2.336) was shown in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when compared between DR and DNR patients, there was no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study which shows that SLC2A1 26177G allele is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Malaysian population but not with DR </plain></SENT>
