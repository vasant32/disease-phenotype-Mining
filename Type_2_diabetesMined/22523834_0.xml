<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to assess D-dimer level (as a marker of coagulation cascade/fibrinolysis activation) in type 1 and type 2 diabetics and its correlation with microvascular complications and serum total cholesterol (TC) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety patients were included divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1; comprised 50 type 1 diabetics with a mean age of 13.56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their disease duration ranged between 0.4-16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 2; comprised 40 type 2 diabetics with a mean age of 13.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their disease duration ranged between 0.4-8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were compared to 60 healthy age and sex matched subjects served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations included; fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, quantitative urinary albumin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR), serum TC and measurement of plasma D-dimer levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 diabetics had significantly higher weight and body mass index (BMI) Standard deviation score (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) (p&lt;0.0001) compared to type 1 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetics had higher TC (p&lt;0.04) and D-dimer levels (p&lt;0.05) compared to type 1 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>D-dimer level was highly significantly elevated among type 1 diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> compared to non-complicated patients (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>D-dimer was significantly correlated with ACR (p&lt;0.001) in both studied groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetics, TC level was positively correlated with BMI <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.05), D-dimer level was significantly correlated with disease duration (p&lt;0.05), blood pressure (p&lt;0.01), and TC (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In type 1 diabetics, D-dimer levels were positively correlated with blood pressure (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In both types, D-dimer is positively correlated with ACR (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a tendency to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> in both types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may play a role in the development of diabetic microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
