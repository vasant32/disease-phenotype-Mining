<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most of the investigations were based on Han people, who account for the majority of people in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications in the She people, who have their own traditional lifestyle and hereditable background, different from other Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and associated risk factors in the adult population of She nationals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 5,385 participants entered into the analysis eventually, including 2,308 men and 3,077 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed in subjects without diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liver function, cardiovascular risk (brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and abnormal Minnesota codes findings), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> were tested to assess the profiles of associated risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In general, the self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> rate was 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After age and sex standardization, the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6.1% (6.7% for men and 5.7% for women) in She Chinese people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression models, age, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, alcohol use, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this cross-sectional study (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 47.4% had cardiovascular risks, 19.4% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, and 6.2% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For women, compared with the first quartile, log-transformed homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of the fourth quartile was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05), and log-transformed homeostasis model assessment for Î² cells was also higher in the second, third, and fourth quartiles (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> in impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), IFG/IGT, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) were 16.1%, 13.1%, 18.6%, and 28.4% separately, which was higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> in IFG/IGT and DM were higher than that in IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that a total of 6.1% She people suffered from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which was lower than the average level of China, but the standardized prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> was higher, 20.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> screening should be performed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Toronto Clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> Scoring System is convenient to assess diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> in clinical practice and should be tested regularly for people in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
