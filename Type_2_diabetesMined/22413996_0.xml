<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>29, 1253-1259 (2012) ABSTRACT: Aims  <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> levels are inversely related to blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given that low sun exposure can create a greater reliance on dietary sources of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, we aimed to determine whether dietary <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and blood pressure associations differ between periods of low and high sun exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods  Dietary intake, vitamin supplementation, blood pressure, and anthropometric parameters were assessed each season for 1 year (174 adults with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separate linear regression models were constructed for high and low sun exposure periods to examine associations of systolic blood pressure with dietary <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake and vitamin supplement use (adjusted for age, gender, BMI, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication and nutrient intake) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Robustness of findings was confirmed with within-subject repeated measures analysis, including an interaction term for sun exposure period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results  <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> intake from food sources was low year-round and no conclusive association with blood pressure was identified during either period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was 5.1 mmHg lower during the low sun exposure period (95% CI 0.5-9.7) in daily supplement users compared with non-users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interaction term between supplement use and sun exposure period was significant (low sun exposure* no supplement, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was relatively stable in users (low and high sun exposure periods, respectively, mean ± SE: 135.2 ± 2.6 mmHg and 134.2 ± 2.5 mmHg), but not in non-users (140.2 ± 2.7 mmHg and 130.5 ± 2.5 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions  Vitamin supplementation may stabilize systolic blood pressure in adults with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across seasons </plain></SENT>
