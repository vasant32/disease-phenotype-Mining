<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have identified common variants in forkhead box O3 gene (FOXO3) to be strongly associated with longevity in different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But studies have not been carried out to analyse the role of common variants in FOXO3 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an age related disorder and FOXO proteins play an important role in the regulation of metabolism, we studied the role of common variants in FOXO3 for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in 994 type 2 diabetic samples and 984 normoglycemic control samples from a South Indian Dravidian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our analysis, we found that there was no association between any of the selected SNPs in FOXO3 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these SNPs with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> related biochemical and clinical parameters also did not reveal any significant association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype association of SNPs in FOXO3 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed, but the frequency of the haplotypes was considerably lower and they do not remain significant after correction for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we did not observe any association of SNPs in FOXO3 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related parameters suggesting an entirely different mechanism by which these SNPs influence longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However additional studies in other populations are required to completely rule out the association of common variants in FOXO3 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
