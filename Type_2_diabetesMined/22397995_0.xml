<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The seeds of fenugreek, Trigonella foenum graecum, commonly used as a spice in Middle Eastern countries and widely used in south Asia and Europe, are known to have anti-diabetic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They contain an unusual amino acid (2S, 3R, 4S) 4-hydroxyisoleucine (4HO<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>), so far found only in fenugreek, which has anti-diabetic properties of enhancing insulin secretion under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851834" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemic conditions</z:e>, and increasing insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe for the first time the anti-diabetic activity of 4HO<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi> in a model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>type I diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-treated rats, where levels of insulin are much reduced, by 65%, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of diabetic rats with daily doses of 4HO<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi> at 50 mg/kg/day for four weeks could reduce plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover the high levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> in the diabetic rats, could be restored to levels found in non-diabetic controls by the treatment with 4HO<z:chebi fb="2" ids="30009">-Ile </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that 4HO<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi> has significant anti-diabetic activities that are independent of insulin and suggest the potential of 4HO<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi> as an adjunct to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment and for type 1 as well as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
