<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We modeled the genetic architecture underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and developed a new method using polygenic risk-score analyses to infer the total liability-scale variance explained by associated GWAS SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this method, we estimated that, together, thousands of SNPs from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> GWAS explain an additional 20% of disease risk (excluding known associated loci) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further tested this method on datasets for three additional diseases and obtained comparable estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> (43% excluding the major histocompatibility complex), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (48%) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with simulated genetic models in which hundreds of associated loci harbor common causal variants and a smaller number of loci harbor multiple rare causal variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These analyses suggest that GWAS will continue to be highly productive for the discovery of additional susceptibility loci for common diseases </plain></SENT>
