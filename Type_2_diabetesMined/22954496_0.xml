<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Folk medicine from Rayalaseema (Andhra Pradesh, India) reported wide spread usage in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the hypoglycemic properties and mechanism of the methanolic fraction of C. anthelminticum seeds (CAMFs) on mouse β-TC6 pancreatic cell line and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced diabetic rat models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the crude methanolic fraction of C. anthelminticum seeds (CAMFs) on β-TC6 cell line and confirmed its effects on type 1 and type 2 diabetic rats to understand its mechanism in managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAMFs were initially tested on β-TC6 cells for cytotoxicity, 2-NBDG <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter (GLUT-1, 2 and 4) protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic and STZ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi>-induced type 2 diabetic rats were intraperitoneally (i.p) injected or administered orally with CAMFs daily for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of CAMFs on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels was subsequently evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In cell line studies, CAMFs showed non-cytotoxic effect on β-TC6 cell proliferation compared to untreated control cells at 50μg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CAMFs increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and insulin secretion dose-dependently by up-regulating GLUT-2 and GLUT-4 expression in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further in vivo studies on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> induced diabetic rat models revealed that CAMFs significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> by augmenting insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, CAMFs displayed less significant effects on type 1 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAMFs demonstrated anti-diabetic potential on β-TC6 cells and type 2 diabetic rat model, plausibly through enhancing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
