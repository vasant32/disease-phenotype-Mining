<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prior type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have generated a list of well-replicated susceptibility loci in populations of European and Asian ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To validate the trans-ethnic contribution of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in these GWASs, we performed a family-based association analysis of 32 selected GWAS SNPs in a cohort of 1496 African-American (AA) subjects from the Genetics of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> (GENNID) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional roles of these SNPs were evaluated by screening cis-eQTLs in transformed lymphoblast cell lines available for a sub-group of Genetics of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> (GENNID) families from Arkansas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only three of the 32 GWAS-derived SNPs showed nominally significant association with T2D in our AA cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the replicated SNPs rs864745 in JAZF1 and rs10490072 in BCL11A gene (P=0.006 and 0.03, respectively, after adjustment for body mass index) were within the 1-lod drop support interval of T2D linkage peaks reported in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of 19 tag SNPs in these two loci revealed no further common SNPs or haplotypes that may be a stronger predictor of T2D susceptibility than the index SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six T2D GWAS SNPs (rs6698181, rs9472138, rs730497, rs10811661, rs11037909 and rs1153188) were associated with nearby transcript expression in transformed lymphoblast cell lines of GENNID AA subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study indicates a nominal role for JAZF1 and BCL11A variants in T2D susceptibility in AAs and suggested little overlap in known susceptibility to T2D between European- and African-derived populations when considering GWAS SNPs alone </plain></SENT>
