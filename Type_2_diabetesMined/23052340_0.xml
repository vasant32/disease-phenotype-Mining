<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three diabetic mutant mouse lines derived from the Munich <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">ENU</z:chebi>) mouse mutagenesis project and one transgenic mouse line were analyzed with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-relevant clinical, pathomorphological and therapeutic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An Ins2 mutation and two Gck mutations were identified as the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in the mutant lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous Ins2 and homozygous Gck mutants serve as model for permanent neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (PNDM) and heterozygous Gck mutants develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> typeÂ 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dominant-negative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> receptor (GIPR(dn)) transgenic mice exhibit defective postnatal islet growth, develop PNDM and progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated kidney lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutant and transgenic diabetic mouse models analyzed in the study were shown to represent valuable models to study the pathogenesis of monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to establish novel treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
