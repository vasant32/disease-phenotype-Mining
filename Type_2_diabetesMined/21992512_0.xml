<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were collected from 2572 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for gender, age and education, Tobit and logistic regression models were used to examine associations between social network and patient activation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740697" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychosocial problems</z:e>, self-management behaviours and HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequent contact with friends was associated with more positive scores for activation, fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740697" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychosocial problems</z:e>, more positive assessment of care and health-promoting self-management behaviours such as frequent exercising and frequent foot examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequent contact with family was associated with more positive assessments of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Living with a partner was associated with lower prevalence of smoking, a higher frequency of foot examinations and higher HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A poor functional social network, measured as perceived lack of help in the event of severe illness, was associated with low patient activation, greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e>, negative assessment of care, less health-promoting eating habits and less frequent foot examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Good social support is significantly associated with health-promoting behaviours and well-being among patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, HbA(1c) levels are higher for cohabitant persons, indicating barriers for social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intervention research is needed to investigate the causal relationship between social networks and health-promoting behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This knowledge should be used in clinical practice when targeting and designing education, support and care for patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
