<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Anonymized data of 120,183 people with T2DM from the German/Austrian multicenter <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Patienten Verlaufsdokumentation database were analyzed based on chronological age or age at diagnosis (0-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, and ≥80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, and BMI comparisons with clinical phenotype were made using χ(2) and Kruskal-Wallis tests (SAS V9.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, 51.3% were male, average age was 67.112.7 years, and average disease duration was 9.99.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More girls than boys were diagnosed during adolescence and more men than women during adulthood (2060 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No gender differences existed when age at diagnosis was 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> on average (BMI: 30.5±6.1 kg/m(2)) and had significantly higher BMI values than German population peers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BMI gap was widest in the younger age categories and closed with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adult women were significantly more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> patients more often had elevated HbA1c (≥7.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (irrespective of age), <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (adults), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (elderly) than nonobese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More men than women (20-60 years) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> while more women than men (≥60 years) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During puberty, more girls than boys were diagnosed with T2DM while during adulthood males predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>T2DM manifested at comparatively lower BMI in males, and younger patients were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, and BMI were also associated with poor metabolic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> comorbidities/complications </plain></SENT>
