<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods:  Nine hundred and forty patients [with a glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) concentration greater than 7% and a body mass index greater than 25 kg/m(2) ] from 57 general practices participated in a cross-sectional survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Misperception of lifestyles (fruit, vegetable, and fat consumption and physical activity) and readiness to change were determined with validated questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis calculated the association of misperception with readiness to change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results:  The response rate was 55.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Misperception existed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, 41.5%; and consumption of fruit, 40.1%; vegetables, 69.2%; and fat, 21.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Misperception significantly affected the readiness to change the relevant lifestyles [odd ratios from 2.67 (1.68-4.23) to 1.80 (1.16-2.79)] except for fruit consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of misperception varied greatly between the different lifestyle behaviors and was somewhat larger (1% to 10%) than that in the Dutch general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> misperceive their lifestyle behaviors, which hinders lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The variations in misperception and readiness to change show that diversity should be considered in lifestyle counseling for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
