<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, no patient-reported medication adherence measure has been validated in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to validate a modified 4-item Morisky-Green-Levine Medication Adherence Scale in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a sample of outpatients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Singapore from September to December in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Respondents completed either an English or Chinese version of the modified 4-item Morisky-Green-Levine Medication Adherence Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The scale scores ranged from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating better medication adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Content validity was assessed by expert review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Construct validity was examined using factor analysis and hypothesis testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 294 respondents who completed the modified Morisky-Green-Levine Medication Adherence Scale, 13.3, 21.4, 35.7 and 29.6% had a score of 0-1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The internal consistency of the scale was moderate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis showed that the four items loaded onto one factor (eigenvalue = 1.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Respondents with higher scores were older (P &lt; 0.001), had lower HbA(1c) levels (P &lt; 0.001) and had better adherence to physician-recommended diet (P &lt; 0.001) and physical exercise (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of the modified Morisky-Green-Levine Medication Adherence Scale were less than satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A ceiling effect was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The scale may not be an adequate measure to assess medication adherence in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Future research could target refining the scale and investigating its use in other patient populations </plain></SENT>
