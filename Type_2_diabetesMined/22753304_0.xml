<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With globalization, this way of eating is becoming more common in developing and recently developed populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the association of Western-style fast food intake with risk of incident type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> mortality in Chinese Singaporeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This analysis included men and women 45 to 74 years of age who enrolled in the Singapore Chinese Health Study from 1993 to 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For CHD mortality, 52 584 participants were included and 1397 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were identified through December 31, 2009, via registry linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 43 176 participants were included and 2252 cases were identified during the follow-up interview (1999-2004) and validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios for incident type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> mortality were estimated with thorough adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chinese Singaporeans with relatively frequent intake of Western-style fast food items (â‰¥2 times per week) had an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.54) and dying of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.06) relative to their peers with little or no reported intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were not materially altered by adjustments for overall dietary pattern, energy intake, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Western-style fast food intake is associated with increased risk of developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> mortality in an Eastern population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the need for further attention to global dietary acculturation in the context of ongoing epidemiological and nutrition transitions </plain></SENT>
