<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic diseases</z:e> is a condition seldom thought of in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, a high percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001738'>exocrine pancreatic insufficiency</z:hpo> has been reported for the general population and especially for diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we investigated 1868 patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who had been admitted to our hospital during the last 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient data were diligently studied, and patients were reclassified according to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> classification as proposed by the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1868 subjects, 172 patients could be classified as type 3c <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (9.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these were 135 diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> (78.5%), 12 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary haemochromatosis</z:e>, 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> and 7 with cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> occurred in this collective in 7.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Misclassification of these patients was very common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 51.2% (88/172) were initially classified correctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most type 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were initially misclassified as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (69/84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic diseases</z:e> (especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo>) seems more common than generally believed with a prevalence of 9.2% among the subjects studied here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because the awareness of this <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type is poor, misclassification is quite frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A common problem seems to be the differentiation between type 2 and type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Yet, the right classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is important, because there are special therapeutic options and problems in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
