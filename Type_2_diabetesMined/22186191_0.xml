<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of this increased oxidative status a cellular adaptive response occurs requiring functional chaperones, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> production and protein degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and cellular stress response in patients suffering from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in age-matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> has been evaluated by measuring plasma reduced and oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, as well as pentosidine, protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyls</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation products <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxy-2-nonenal</z:chebi> and F2-isoprostanes in plasma, and lymphocytes, whereas the lymphocyte levels of the heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) HO-1, Hsp72, Sirtuin-1, Sirtuin-2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> reductase-1 (TrxR-1) have been measured to evaluate the systemic cellular stress response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma GSH/GSSG showed a significant decrease in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as compared to control group, associated with increased pentosidine, F2-isoprostanes, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyls</z:chebi> and HNE levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, lymphocyte levels of HO-1, Hsp70, Trx and TrxR-1 (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01) in diabetic patients were higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, while sirtuin-1 and sirtuin-2 protein was significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients affected by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are under condition of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and, although the relevance of downregulation in sirtuin signal has to be fully understood, however induction of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> protein system represent a maintained response in counteracting systemic pro-oxidant status </plain></SENT>
