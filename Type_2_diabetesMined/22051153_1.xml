<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endogenous incretins have been shown to be important regulators of bone turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess whether a dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor affects markers of bone resorption and calcium homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study was a single-center, double blind, randomized clinical trail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine drug-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) were randomized to either 1 year treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin (100 mg, once daily; n = 29) or placebo (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received a standardized breakfast after measurement of serum concentrations of cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide (s-CTx), a bone resorption marker influenced by food intake, before and after 50 weeks treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vildagliptin did not change postprandial s-CTx concentrations compared with pretreatment levels (between-group ratio 1.15 ± 0.17; P = 0.320) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphate were also unaffected y 1 year treatment with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with vildagliptin for 1 year was not associated with changes in markers of bone resorption and calcium homeostasis in drug-naïve patients with T2D and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
