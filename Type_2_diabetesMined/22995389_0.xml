<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Milk contains two primary sources of protein, casein (80%) and whey (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the beneficial physiological effects of whey protein on the control of food intake and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown an insulinotropic and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering properties of whey protein in healthy and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whey protein seems to induce these effects via bioactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and amino acids generated during its gastrointestinal digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These amino acids and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> stimulate the release of several gut hormones, such as cholecystokinin, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY and the incretins gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 that potentiate insulin secretion from Î²-cells and are associated with regulation of food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bioactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> generated from whey protein may also serve as endogenous inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) in the proximal gut, preventing incretin degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, recently, DPP-4 inhibitors were identified in whey protein hydrolysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on the emerging properties of whey protein and its potential clinical application for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
