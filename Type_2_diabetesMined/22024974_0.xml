<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, impairment of glycemic control occurs despite substantial insulin secretion early in the course of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dysfunction of several organs (including pancreatic islets, liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, gut, hypothalamus and the immune system) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-promoting lifestyle factors do not inevitably cause disease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, defense mechanisms must exist that can keep the detrimental influence of these risk factors at bay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hormesis describes the phenomenon that exposure to a mild stressor confers resistance to subsequent, otherwise harmful, conditions of increased stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This Review discusses the emerging concept that the effectiveness of an adaptive (hormetic) response to detrimental lifestyle factors determines the extent of protection from progression to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of these protective hormetic responses at the molecular level should help to identify novel targets for preventive or therapeutic intervention in patients at risk of developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or those with overt disease </plain></SENT>
