<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few instruments have been developed to measure health promotion self-care behavior of patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Developing and psychometric testing of the Chinese version of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Health Promotion Self-Care Scale (DHPSC) for patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred and eighty-nine patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited from <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> clinics in four hospitals in Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess the construct validity of the scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the DHPSC and the satisfaction subscale of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Quality of Life, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Empowerment Scale, and HbA1c were calculated to evaluate concurrent validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were used to assess the reliability of the scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted in 2007 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A proposed second-order factor model with seven subscales and 26 items fit the data well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The seven subscales were interpersonal relationships, diet, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring, personal health responsibility, exercise, adherence to the recommended regimens, and foot care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The DHPSC statistically significantly correlated with the satisfaction subscale of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Quality of Life and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Empowerment Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HbA1c only statistically significantly correlated with the subscale of health responsibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reliability was supported by acceptable Cronbach's alpha (range, .78-.94) and test-retest reliability (range, .76-.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The DHPSC has satisfactory reliability and validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Healthcare providers can use the DHPSC to comprehensively assess the health promotion self-care behaviors of patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
