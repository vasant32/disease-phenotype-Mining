<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> can be effectively controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> that interrupt the renin-angiotensin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the efficiency of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> cysteine (NAC) in preventing diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renoprotective effects of angiotensin receptor blockers and NAC in preventing or reducing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 70 patients with type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomly divided into two groups and were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, 25 mg, twice per day, with and without NAC, 600 mg twice daily (study and control groups, respectively; 35 patients in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urine protein was checked before treatment and after 2 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two groups were comparable regarding gender, age, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and urine protein excretion levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>Proteinuria</z:hpo> improved in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> level decreased more in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> and NAC; however, comparison of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> between the two groups showed no significant difference after 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin receptor blockers reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> due to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and this study failed to detect additional effect when NAC was combined with these medications </plain></SENT>
