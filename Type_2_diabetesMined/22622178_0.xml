<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increasing prevalence worldwide is generating a great health and social concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical intervention studies such as the UKPDS have shown that although the metabolic control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> may improve with intensive intervention programs, these are highly expensive and do not lead to an optimal metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this reason, one of the main challenges in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> at present is its prevention </plain></SENT>
