<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to replicate in a Lebanese Arab population identified associations of IGF2BP2 variants rs4402960 and rs1470579 with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This case-control study involved 544 T2DM patients and 606 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was done by the allelic exclusion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T allele of rs440960 (P=6.5 × 10(-6)) and C allele of rs1470579 (P=5.3 × 10(-4)) were significantly associated with T2DM; both SNPs were in strong LD (D'=0.83, r(2)=0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While both IGF2BP2 SNPs were significantly associated with T2DM under additive and recessive models, only rs4402960 remained significantly associated with T2DM under the dominant model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taking the common rs4402960/rs1470579 GA haplotype as reference, multivariate analysis confirmed the positive association of TC (P=0.009; OR, 1.43; 95%CI, 1.09-1.87), and TA (P&lt;0.001; OR=5.49; 95%CI=2.09-14.39) haplotypes with increased T2DM risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences remained significant after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We validate that IGF2BP2 susceptibility variants rs4402960 and rs1470579 associate with T2DM in Lebanese Arabs </plain></SENT>
