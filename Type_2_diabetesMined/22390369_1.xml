<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and DPP-4 inhibitors act on the incretin system to regulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, there are important clinical differences among the five agents currently available in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, the GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> require subcutaneous administration, produce pharmacological levels of GLP-1 activity, promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, have a more robust <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect, and have a higher incidence of adverse gastrointestinal effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the DPP-4 inhibitors are taken orally, increase the half-life of endogenous GLP-1, are weight neutral, and are more commonly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nasopharyngitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in efficacy, safety, tolerability, and cost among the incretin-based therapies are important to consider in the primary care management of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
