<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we hypothesized that treatment with pravastatin (an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="11814">3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA</z:chebi> reductase) would normalize the ET-1-induced contraction in aortas isolated from type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contractile responses were examined by measuring isometric force in endothelium-denuded aortic helical strips from four groups: Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO; genetic control), OLETF (type 2 diabetic), pravastatin-treated LETO, and pravastatin-treated OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation assays were used to examine Src, protein phosphatase (PP)2A, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR)1, and ERK signaling pathway protein levels and activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In endothelium-denuded aortas isolated from OLETF rats at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (56-60 wk) (vs. those from age-matched LETO rats), we found the following: 1) ET-1-induced contraction was enhanced, 2) ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased, 3) phosphorylations of KSR1 and PP2A were reduced (i.e., enhancement of the kinase active state), 4) ERK1/2-KSR1 complexes were increased, and 5) Src tyrosine kinase activity was diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-denuded aortas isolated from OLETF rats treated with pravastatin (10 mg/kg po, daily for 4 wk) exhibited normalized ET-1-induced contractions and suppressed ET-1-stimulated ERK phosphorylation, with the associated phosphorylated KSR1 and phosphorylated PP2A levels being increased toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in type 2 diabetic rats, pravastatin normalizes ET-1-induced contraction in aortic smooth muscle via a suppression of PP2A/KSR1/ERK activities after an enhancement of Src kinase activity </plain></SENT>
