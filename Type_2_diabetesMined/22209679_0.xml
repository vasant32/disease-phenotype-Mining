<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although dietary fat contributes substantially to the accumulation of liver fat, the role of individual fatty acids in this accumulation is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study, we set out to determine whether liver fat content (LFC), was associated with red blood cell fatty acid (RBC-FA) composition in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixty-two type 2 diabetic patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LFC was measured using (1)H-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> Spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RBC-FA composition was measured by gas chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and nine (67.2%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> had a higher BMI (p = 0.0005), and higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (p = 0.009) than did patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report a significant association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> (16:0), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28716">palmitoleic acid</z:chebi> (16:1n-7) concentrations and ratio of monounsaturated to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28716">palmitoleic acid</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi>) and higher liver fat content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> (PUFA), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53486">homo-gamma-linolenic acid</z:chebi> (20:3n-6), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (22:6n-3), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (20:4 n-6) were associated with lower LFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that an increased erythrocytes long-chain n-3 and n-6 fatty acids was associated with a lower prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that n-3 and n-6 fatty acids supplementation could be a promising treatment for NAFLD in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
