<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Anonymized computer data from the Quality Improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kidney Disease</z:e> (QICKD) trial (n = 942,031) were analysed using a binary method to assess the accuracy of data on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic codes were processed and stratified into: definite, probable and possible diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy was improved by using prescription compatibility and temporally sequenced anthropomorphic and biochemical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bayesian false detection rate analysis was used to compare findings with those of an entirely independent and more complex manual sort of the first round QICKD study data (n = 760,588) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of definite diagnosis of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 0.32% and 3.27% respectively when using the binary search method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Up to 35% of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 0.1% of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were miscoded or misclassified on the basis of age/BMI and coding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>False detection rate analysis demonstrated a close correlation between the new method and the published hand-crafted sort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both methods had the highest false detection rate values when coding, therapeutic, anthropomorphic and biochemical filters were used (up to 90% for the new and 75% for the hand-crafted search method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple computerized algorithm achieves very similar results to more complex search strategies to identify miscoded and misclassified cases of both Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has the potential to be used as an automated audit instrument to improve quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
