<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Two-condition 2-period randomized crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University General Clinical Research Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen healthy patients with parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (9 females and 9 males, age 27 yr [standard deviation 3], body mass index 23.7 [2.3] kg/mÂ²) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Two week-long inpatient sessions with 8.5 or 5.5-hr nighttime sleep opportunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants who exercised regularly (39%) could follow their usual exercise routines during both sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep and total body movement were measured by wrist actigraphy and waist accelerometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjective mood and vigor was assessed using visual analog scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was the comparison of total activity counts between sleep conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ancillary endpoints included changes in sedentary, light, and moderate plus vigorous activity, and their association with changes in mood and vigor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Daily sleep was reduced by 2.3 hr (P &lt; 0.001) and total activity counts were 31% lower (P = 0.020) during the 5.5-hr time-in-bed condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a 24% reduction in moderate-plus-vigorous activity time (P = 0.005) and more sedentary behavior (+21 min/day; P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The decrease in daily activity during the 5.5-hr time-in-bed condition was seen mostly in participants who exercised regularly (-39 versus -4% in exercisers versus nonexercisers; P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sleep loss-related declines in physical activity correlated strongly with declines in subjective vigor (R = 0.90; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Experimental sleep restriction results in decreased amount and intensity of physical activity in adults at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
