<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life studies among adults with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, using the EQ-5D, have been short term and have not assessed change over years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the change in health status and health-related quality of life over 5 years among individuals with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Respondents to the US Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (SHIELD) completed the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) at baseline (2004) and 5 years later (2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual analog scale (VAS) score and health index score were computed at baseline and year 5, and the change over 5 years was measured for individuals with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and T2DM adults with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear regression models were used to determine change in EQ-5D score, controlling for age, gender, race, education, household income, and body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was significantly greater decline in the EQ-5D index score in the T2DM group (-0.031 [SD 0.158]), compared with those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (-0.016 [0.141], p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with respondents without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, those with T2DM had a larger reduction in EQ-5D index score, after controlling for demographics (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EQ-5D VAS score declined over 5 years for both groups: -1.42 (18.1) for the T2DM group, and -0.63 (15.8) for the group without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the between-group difference was not significant either before (p = 0.09) or after (p = 0.12), controlling for demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T2DM respondents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> had a greater decline in EQ-5D scores than T2DM respondents without complications (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Over a 5-year period, health status of respondents with T2DM declined significantly compared with those with no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, indicating that the burden of the disease has a long-term detrimental impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This decline in health status is likely to impact utility scores (fewer quality-adjusted life years) for economic evaluations </plain></SENT>
