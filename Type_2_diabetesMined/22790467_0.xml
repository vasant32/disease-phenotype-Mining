<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 150 patients with type 2 DM for pain and shoulder dysfunction with the UCLA-m (modified University of California at Los Angeles Shoulder Rating Scale); for epidemiological and treatment data, values of Hb A(1C) and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pain was present in 63.4%, and dysfunction in 53.4% of the studied sample; 26.6% of the patients rated shoulder performance as bad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No association was found between Hb A(1C) or plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and joint function, except for active flexion of the shoulder and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women had worse shoulder performance (p = 0.0043), as did elderly patients (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder pain and dysfunction is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; these disorders affect more women and the elderly </plain></SENT>
