<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with increased cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The comparative effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> plus fibrate combination therapy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy in reducing risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in real-world settings is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was performed using a large managed care claims database of patients identified with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on diagnosis codes from January 2002 through December 2003 and continuously enrolled for the entire study period, 5.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> plus fibrate combination therapy group (patients who used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> less than 6 months and augmented with fibrates for more than 6 months) and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy group (patients who used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> persistently) among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were followed for 3 years to examine the relationship between the intervention and cardiovascular events using a multivariable logistic regression model, propensity score method, and instrumental variable approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> plus fibrate combination therapy group of 318 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy group of 9928 were identified from 75,515 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for factors that can impact cardiovascular outcomes, the combination therapy group did not significantly experience a reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, as compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy group (OR = 0.77; p = 0.083) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> plus fibrate combination therapy group was significantly associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events after propensity matching (OR = 0.53; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the physician prescribing preference instrument to adjust for unmeasured confounding, we did not find evidence that subjects in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> plus fibrate combination therapy group versus stain monotherapy group experienced a significant reduction in cardiovascular events (p = 0.124) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We did not find a difference in effectiveness regarding cardiovascular outcomes between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> plus fibrate combination therapy and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy after controlling for hidden bias </plain></SENT>
