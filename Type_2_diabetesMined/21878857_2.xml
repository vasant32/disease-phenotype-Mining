<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This cross-sectional study examines the existence and frequency of functional and structural abnormalities in the adolescent Type 1 diabetic retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also compare the results with those of adolescents with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two adolescents with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (5.7 ± 3.6 years; mean duration ± SD), 15 with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (2.1 ± 1.3 years), and 26 age-matched control subjects were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multifocal electroretinogram responses from 103 retinal regions were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optical coherence tomography was used to measure <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular diameter around the optic nerve was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of the 32 (28%) adolescents with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 6 of the 15 (40%) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significant multifocal electroretinogram implicit time delays compared with 2 of the 26 controls (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> thicknesses in both patient groups were significantly (P ≤ 0.01) thinner than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Type 2 group also showed significant (P ≤ 0.03) <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venular dilation (235.8 ± 5.9 μm) compared with controls (219.6 ± 4.0 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study illustrates that subtle but significant functional and structural changes occur very early in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adolescents with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appear to be more affected than those with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further longitudinal examination of the etiology and progression of these abnormalities is warranted </plain></SENT>
