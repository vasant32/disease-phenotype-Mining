<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In a randomized, multi-centre trial, the effect of an education programme (MEDIAS 2 ICT) involving intensive insulin treatment for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was compared with an established education programme as an active comparator condition (ACC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated whether MEDIAS 2 ICT was non-inferior to ACC in overall glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge, quality of life, self-care behavior, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 186 subjects were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a six month follow-up the mean HbA1c decrease was 0.37% (from 8.2±1.1% to 7.8±1.5%) in the ACC and 0.63% (from 8.5±1.5% to 7.9±1.2%) in MEDIAS 2 ICT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean difference between both groups was -0.26% (95% CI -0.63 to -0.14) in favor of MEDIAS 2 ICT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result was within the predefined limit for non-inferiority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related distress was significantly more reduced in MEDIAS 2 ICT (-3.4±7.1) than in ACC (0.4±9.0; p=0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MEDIAS 2 ICT is as effective in lowering HbA1c as previously established education programmes, but showed superiority in reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: MEDIAS 2 ICT provides an alternative for education of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated by multiple injection therapy </plain></SENT>
