<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are strongly linked, and patients with any of these disorders are usually advised to be physically active based on existing evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, different psychosocial constructs are found in separate settings to influence the physical activity levels of these different groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, there is a need to establish the most important of the constructs to influence low physical activity in these groups of patients from Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 509 participants aged 35-80 years from randomly selected health facilities in South-western Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical activity level, self-efficacy, social support and perceived barriers of the participants were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale, Medical Outcomes Social Support Scale and Exercise Benefits and Barrier Scale, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The odds of having low physical activity was highest in those with low social support for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (OR=3.95, 95% CI=3.13-5.24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR=2.72, 95% CI=1.98-3.91) and mixed disorders (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.19-3.15) while high perceived barriers was associated with the highest odds (OR=1.79, 95% CI=1.23-2.87) for low physical activity in hypertensive participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low social support had the highest influence in establishing low physical activity in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and those with mixed disorders and the amount of influence was highest in those with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Psychosocial constructs should be considered by giving priority to social support when prescribing physical activity especially for patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and those with mixed disorders </plain></SENT>
