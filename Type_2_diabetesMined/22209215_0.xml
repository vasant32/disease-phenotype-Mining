<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether participation in a motivational interview for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> would improve their self-management, psychological and glycemic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of the motivational interviewing intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: Participants were drawn from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outpatient clinic of a large teaching hospital in South Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 250 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> people were randomly allocated into either the motivational interview group or the usual care group from baseline to 3 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intervention was based on motivational interviewing which encompassed a variety of interviewing techniques, and reflected each person's readiness stage to change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group was provided with usual care by nursing staff </plain></SENT>
