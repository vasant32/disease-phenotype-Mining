<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in Î²-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology </plain></SENT>
