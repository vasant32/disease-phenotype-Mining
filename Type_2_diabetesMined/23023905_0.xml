<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acid</z:chebi> supplementation on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-α) in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 84 subjects aged 45-85 years with at least a two-year history of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each subject in the treatment group received three omega-3 capsules per day (eicosapentaenoic acid 1,548 mg; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> 828 mg; other <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi> 338 mg), while each subject in the control group received three placebo capsules (sunflower oil 2,100 mg) for a period of eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of the study and post intervention, fasting blood samples were taken and serum concentrations of IL-2, TNF-α and CRP were assessed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Serum IL-2 and TNF-α levels were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared to the controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in serum CRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acid</z:chebi> supplementation (3 g/day for eight weeks) can decrease the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-2 in diabetic patients, with no change in CRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consumption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acid</z:chebi> supplements is highly recommended to alleviate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> caused by type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
