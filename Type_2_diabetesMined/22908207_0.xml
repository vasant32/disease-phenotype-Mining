<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the gene-disease association in relevant studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electronic literature search was performed on June 18, 2011, from databases of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and HuGE Navigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Articles were inspected by 2 authors independently, and data were extracted by identical extraction form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 5,528 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 6,920 controls in relation to HFE polymorphisms (a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at amino acid position 282 (C282Y) and a histidine to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> substitution at amino acid position 63 (H63D)) were included in the meta-analysis (1997-2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fixed- or random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratios based on the results from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased odds ratio for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was observed in persons carrying a D allele at the H63D polymorphism compared with those with an H allele (odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.41; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, carriers of a D allele had a modestly increased risk compared with persons with the wild genotype (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.25; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The C282Y variant was not significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, persons with a D allele may have a moderately increased risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
