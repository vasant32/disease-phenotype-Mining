<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A historical cohort study based on representative German real life data (IMS(®) Disease Analyzer) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who started an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug (OAD) treatment between 01/1995 and 12/2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with consecutive treatment data for at least 12 months before the initiation of an OAD treatment were eligible for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time-dependent rate of patients starting an insulin therapy with a long-acting insulin was calculated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to identify associated factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 194,967 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> being on OAD therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>24,964 patients were switched to BOT during the observational period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of switching to insulin therapy was associated with three main predictors such as (1) poor metabolic control, (2) midlife age and (3) number and type of the OAD before insulinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The variation of the HbA1c threshold to HbA1c≥7.5 leads to comparable outcomes with significant HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The highest probability of initiating a basal supported oral therapy (BOT) under real life conditions was found for patients with poor metabolic control, midlife age and pre-treatment with specific OADs such as SU, GLI or AGI before initiation of insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
