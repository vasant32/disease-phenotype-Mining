<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the population-based prospective Hoorn Study, 394 individuals with preserved LV systolic and diastolic function participated, of whom 87 had impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and 128 had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements including arterial ultrasound and echocardiography were performed according to standardized protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with more severe LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction 8 years later: LV ejection fraction was 2.98% (95% CI 0.46-5.51) lower, and left atrial (LA) volume index, LV mass index, and tissue Doppler-derived E/e' were 3.71 mL/m(2) (1.20-6.22), 5.86 g/m(2.7) (2.94-8.78), and 1.64 units (0.95-2.33) higher, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, presence of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with 8-year increases in LV mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More arterial stiffness (measured as a lower distensibility) was associated with LV diastolic dysfunction 8 years later: LA volume index, LV mass index, and E/e' at follow-up were higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent adjustments for baseline mean arterial pressure and/or LV diastolic dysfunction did not eliminate these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and arterial stiffness with markers of LV diastolic dysfunction were largely independent of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> status and arterial distensibility are independently associated with more severe LV diastolic dysfunction 8 years later and with deterioration of LV diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and arterial stiffness may relate to LV diastolic dysfunction through different pathways </plain></SENT>
