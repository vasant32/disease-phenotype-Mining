<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the association between spirituality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 201 adult participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from an indigent clinic of an academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants completed validated surveys on spirituality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Daily Spiritual Experience (DSE) Scale measured a person's perception of the transcendent (God, the divine) in daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses examined the association of spirituality as the predictor with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> as the outcome, adjusted for confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Greater spirituality was reported among females, non-Hispanic blacks, those with lower educational levels, and those with lower income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted regression model showed greater spirituality was associated with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was mildly diminished but still significant in the final adjusted model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scores also increased (greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> risk) with females and those who were unemployed but decreased with older age and non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms may be facilitated by incorporating the spiritual values and beliefs of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, faith-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education is likely to improve self-care behaviors and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
