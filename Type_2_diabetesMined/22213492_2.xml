<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have an important role in guiding choices among the numerous medications available to treat type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, but little is known about their quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess whether guidelines on oral medications for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are consistent with a systematic review of the current evidence and whether the consistency of the guidelines depends on the quality of guideline development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, and guideline-specific databases were searched between July 2007 and August 2011, after the 2007 publication of a peer-reviewed systematic review on oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently screened citations to identify English-language guidelines on oral medications to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that were applied in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers assessed whether the guidelines addressed and agreed with 7 evidence-based conclusions from the 2007 systematic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers independently rated guideline quality by using 2 domains from the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 1000 screened citations, 11 guidelines met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven guidelines agreed with the conclusion that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is favored as the first-line agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten guidelines agreed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> are associated with higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> compared with other oral medications to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One guideline addressed no evidence-based conclusions, and 5 guidelines agreed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The summary scores of the rigor of development (median, 28.6% [range, 16.7% to 100.0%]) and editorial independence (median, 75.0% [range, 8.3% to 100.0%]) domains varied greatly across guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Guidelines that received higher quality scores contained more recommendations that were consistent with the evidence-based conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Only English-language guidelines targeting users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada that contained recommendations on oral medications were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> practice guidelines on oral treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were consistent with available evidence from a systematic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Guidelines judged to be of higher quality contained more recommendations consistent with evidence-based conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The quality of guideline development processes varied substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality </plain></SENT>
