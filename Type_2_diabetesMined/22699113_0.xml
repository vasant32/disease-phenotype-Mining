<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> among type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs with or without use of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used mail surveys, administrative claims data, and enrollment information from a sample of adult commercial health plan enrollees (n=813) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' experience of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, its impact on patient perspectives and healthcare utilization were the outcomes evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A greater percentage of patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> with insulin cohort reported experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> compared with patients from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (SU) without insulin and non-SU without insulin cohorts (50% vs. 21% and 12%, respectively; p&lt;0.01 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While 71% of the sample reported experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms with 28% confirmed by low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, only 10% of the patients had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> event in the claims database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> had the highest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> Fear Survey behavior score (8) and worry subscale score (14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were noted between the confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> cohorts for the 12-item Short Form Health Survey's Mental Component Score (p&lt;0.001) and Physical Component Score (p=0.002), and for the EQ-5D index (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related annualized mean total healthcare costs were significantly higher for confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> vs. no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> cohorts (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is a more significant burden among type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs than is estimated by administrative claims data and needs to be considered when choosing therapy </plain></SENT>
