<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitor became available in 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous clinical trials have documented the benefits of continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) in patients with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the data supporting the use of CGM in type 2 DM patients are less substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review article examines the clinical evidence for using CGM in patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An extensive literature search was performed to identify relevant studies for this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Articles published in English from 2000 to May 2010 were identified through searches of PubMed and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases using the search terms type 2 DM and continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relevant references were examined for additional articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The literature search revealed 27 original articles and reviews, 12 of which were included in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five out of the 12 studies reviewed showed a decrease in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> using CGM in patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of CGM in patients with type 2 DM can improve glycemic control, but other benefits include modification of diet and exercise, detection of unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, and identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> excursions </plain></SENT>
