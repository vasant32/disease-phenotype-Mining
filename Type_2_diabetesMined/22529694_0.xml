<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Observational studies assessing the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were identified via electronic and hand searches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies published between 1988 to March 2011 were screened, according to the inclusion criteria set for the present analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Authors performed separate analyses for the comparisons between <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) infected and not infected, and HCV infected and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The included studies were further subgrouped according to the study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heterogenity was assessed using I(2) statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The summary odds ratios with their corresponding 95% CIs were calculated based on a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The included studies were subgrouped according to the study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To assess any factor that could potentially affect the outcome, results were further stratified by age group (proportion of ≥ 40 years), gender (proportion of male gender), body mass index (BMI) (proportion of BMI ≥ 27), and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (i.e., self reported) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For stability of results, a sensitivity analysis was conducted including only prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combining the electronic database and hand searches, a total of 35 observational studies (in 31 articles) were identified for the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on random-effects model, 17 studies (n = 286,084) compared <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C-infected patients with those who were uninfected [summary odds ratio (OR): 1.68, 95% CI: 1.15-2.45] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these 17 studies, 7 were both a cross-sectional design (41.2%) and cohort design (41.2%), while 3 were case-control studies (17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nineteen studies (n = 51,156) compared <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C-infected participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B-infected (summary OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.41-2.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of these 19 studies, 4 (21.1%), 6 (31.6%) and 9 (47.4%) were cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity analysis with 3 prospective studies indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C-infected patients had a higher risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with uninfected controls (summary odds ratio: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.17-1.7; I(2) = 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C-infected patients, male patients (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.03-1.54) with age over 40 years (summary OR: 7.39, 95% CI: 3.82-9.38) had an increased frequency of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Some caution must be taken in the interpretation of these results because there may be unmeasured confounding factors which may introduce bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings support the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The direction of association remains to be determined, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies with adequate sample sizes are recommended </plain></SENT>
