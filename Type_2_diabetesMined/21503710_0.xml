<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional observational analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1,398 persons with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 60 years or older, who responded to the 2003 Health and Retirement Study <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted logistic regressions on the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> on respondents' self-management ability after controlling for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> comorbidities, demographics, and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants with greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were less likely to adhere to exercise (Adjusted Odds ratio [AOR] = 0.725 and 0.712 for moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, both P &lt; 0.05), and to diet (AOR =��0.906 and 0.618 for moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is associated with worse self-care and may pose challenges to diabetic older persons, notably in diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
