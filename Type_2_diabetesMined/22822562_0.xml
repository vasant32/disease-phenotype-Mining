<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary care centers treating type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to give standard care (control group) or standard care with feedback benchmarked against other centers in each country (benchmarking group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was percentage of patients in the benchmarking group achieving pre-set targets of the critical quality indicators: glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbAlc), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol after 12 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Luxembourg, in the benchmarking group, more patients achieved target for SBP (40.2% vs. 20%) and for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (50.4% vs. 44.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>12.9% of patients in the benchmarking group met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three targets compared with patients in the control group (8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this randomized, controlled study, benchmarking was shown to be an effective tool for improving critical quality indicator targets, which are the principal modifiable vascular risk factors in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type 2 </plain></SENT>
