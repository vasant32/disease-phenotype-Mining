<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives were to assess the effect of sugar intake (sugar-sweetened beverages, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>) on association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and related metabolic risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, insulin sensitivity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers), and on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, through a systematic review of prospective cohort studies and randomised controlled intervention studies published between January 2000 and search dates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methods adopted were as follows: the first search was run in PubMed in October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second search with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> as risk marker was run in April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total search strategy was rerun in April 2011 in SveMed+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An update was run in PubMed in January 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion from the 2,743 abstracts according to predefined eligibility criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcome was that out of the 17 studies extracted, 15 were prospective cohort studies and two were randomised controlled crossover trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the studies included only adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (nine studies), four of six prospective cohort studies found a significant positive association for sugar-sweetened beverage intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In general, larger cohort studies with longer follow-up more often reported positive associations, and BMI seemed to mediate part of the increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For other metabolic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> or outcomes, too few studies have been published to draw conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, data from prospective cohort studies published in the years 2000-2011 suggest that sugar-sweetened beverages probably increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For related metabolic risk factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and other types of <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi>, too few studies were available to draw conclusions </plain></SENT>
