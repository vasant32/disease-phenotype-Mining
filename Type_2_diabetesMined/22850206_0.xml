<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recruited twenty-two consecutive Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who had blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuation under the combination therapy of insulin glargine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> initiated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> tapared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels and mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles of seven points in self-monitoring blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) were 7.4 ± 0.6% and 8.6 ± 2.0 mmol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> was initiated with the dose of 50 mg per day and titrated up to 100 mg per day when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> was withdrawn if possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuation was evaluated with SMBG by calculating M-value, its range (the difference of maximum and minimum blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels), and its coefficient of variation (CV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two months after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> add-on, M-value was decreased from 19 ± 13 to 13 ± 8 (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> range and CV were also improved from 9.6 ± 2.9 mmol/L to 7.9 ± 2.6 mmol/L (p = 0.01), and from 33 ± 8% to 29 ± 8% (p &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuation was significantly improved two months after adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and tapering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic Japanese patients who were treated by BOT with insulin glargine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
