<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A urinary metabolomics method based on rapid-resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (RRLC/MS) was developed to investigate the effect of water-soluble ginseng <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> (WGP) on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) was carried out for pattern recognition and a clear separation between type 2 diabetic rats and those treated with WGP was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight potential biomarkers were found and identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, phenylpropionylglycine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4676">dodecanedioic acid</z:chebi> showed the effect of WGP on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18083">1-Methyladenine</z:chebi>, 4-deoxyerythronic acid, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28320">tetrahydrocortisol</z:chebi> were significantly decreased which indicated that WGP can regulate DNA metabolism, organic acids metabolism and steroid hormone metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work is helpful in the effect mechanism study of ginseng <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
