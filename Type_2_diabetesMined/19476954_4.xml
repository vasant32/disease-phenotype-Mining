<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, population-based incidence study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> &lt; or = 15 years of age were registered by the Austrian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Incidence Study Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> type was classified on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings according to <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time trends were estimated by linear regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the observation period, 1881 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 34 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were female, 56% had a positive family history for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 74% presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Austria increased from 12.0 to 18.4/100,000 (P &lt; .001) and the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remained stable below 0.6/100 000 (P = .706) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Austrian children is 10-fold lower than reported in other regions and did not increase over the last 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the same time period, a significant rise in the incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
