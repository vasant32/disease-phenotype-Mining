<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent animal studies suggest a role for myostatin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the possible metabolic role of myostatin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 76 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 92 control subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were matched for age, gender and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples and biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained to assess plasma myostatin and expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (8.9 versus 5.1 mmol/L, P&lt;0.001), plasma insulin (68.2 versus 47.2 pmol/L, P&lt;0.002) and HOMA2-IR (1.6 versus 0.9, P&lt;0.0001) when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had 1.4 (P&lt;0.01) higher levels of muscle myostatin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> content than the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma myostatin concentrations did not differ between patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In healthy controls, muscle myostatin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> correlated with HOMA2-IR (r = 0.30, P&lt;0.01), plasma IL-6 (r = 0.34, P&lt;0.05) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> max (r = -0.26, P&lt;0.05), however, no correlations were observed in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the idea that myostatin may have a negative effect on metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the metabolic effect of myostatin appears to be overruled by other factors in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
