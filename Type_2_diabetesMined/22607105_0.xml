<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was done to determine the significant determinants of uncontrolled blood pressure in T2D patients in Malaysia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2009, data from 70 889 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was obtained from the Adult <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Management Registry for analysis; 303 centers participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their demographic characteristics, the nature of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, their state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, treatment modalities, risk factors, and complications are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on their most recent BP values, subjects were divided into controlled BP and uncontrolled BP and their clinical determinants compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent determinants were identified using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 52.3 ± 11.1 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most were women (59.0 %) and of Malay ethnicity (61.9 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 5.9 ± 5.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 57.4 % were hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 56 503 blood pressure (BP) measured, 13 280 (23.5 %) patients had BP &lt;130/80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighteen percent was on &gt; two anti-hypertensive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Health clinics without doctor, older age (≥ 50 years old), shorter duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&lt; 5 years), Malay, overweight were determinants for uncontrolled blood pressure (BP ≥130/80 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients who were on anti-hypertensive agent/s were 2.7 times more likely to have BP ≥130/80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were about 20 % and 15 % more likely to have their blood pressure treated to target respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Major independent determinants of uncontrolled BP in our group of T2D patients were Malay ethnicity, older age, recent diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, overweight and follow-up at health clinics without a doctor and possibly the improper use of anti hypertensive agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>More effort, education and resources, especially in the primary health care centres are needed to improve hypertensive care among our patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
