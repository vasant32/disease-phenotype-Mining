<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">proanthocyanidin</z:chebi> and its oligomeric form in STZ-induced diabetic model rats and db/db type 2 diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">Proanthocyanidin</z:chebi> ameliorated the diabetic condition by significant decreases of serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycosylated protein, and serum <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen as well as decreases of urinary protein and renal-AGE in STZ-induced diabetic rats and decrease of serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as well as significant decrease of glycosylated protein in db/db type 2 diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The suppression of ROS generation and elevation of the GSH/GSSG ratio were also observed in the groups administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">proanthocyanidin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">proanthocyanidin</z:chebi>, especially its oligomeric form, affected the inflammatory process with the regulation of related protein expression, iNOS, COX-2 and upstream regulators, NF-κB, and the IκB-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, it had a marked effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> through lowering significant levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, and NEFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, expressions in the liver of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were downregulated by the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">proanthocyanidins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in type 1 and 2 diabetic models was significantly strong in the groups administered the oligomeric rather than polymeric form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that oligomers act as a regulator in inflammatory reactions caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
