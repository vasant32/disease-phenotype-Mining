<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>)-induced relaxation and NO production were each attenuated in diabetic aortas (compared with those from age-matched control rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-stimulated Ser(1177)-eNOS (endothelial NO synthase) phosphorylation was significantly decreased in diabetic aortas (compared with their controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> markedly increased the CaMKII phosphorylation level within endothelial cells only in control aortas (as assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-stimulated Thr(286)-CaMKII phosphorylation within endothelial cells was significantly decreased in diabetic aortas (compared with their controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced relaxations, NO production, eNOS phosphorylation, and CaMKII phosphorylation were inhibited by KN93 and/or by lavendustin C (inhibitors of CaMKII) in control aortas, but not in diabetic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-incubation of aortic strips with a PP (protein phosphatase)-1 inhibitor, PPI2 (protein phosphatase inhibitor 2), or with a PP2A inhibitor, CA (cantharidic acid), corrected the above abnormalities in diabetic aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of PP2A type A subunit was increased in diabetic aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-stimulated Thr(320)-phosphorylation level of PP1α was lower in diabetic aortas than in their controls, but the total PP1α protein level was not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the aortic relaxation responses, NO production, and eNOS activity mediated by CaMKII phosphorylation are decreased in this Type 2 diabetic model, and that these impairments of CaMKII signalling may be, at least in part, due to enhancements of PP1α activity and PP2A expression </plain></SENT>
