<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:   The growing incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is emerging as a major health issue throughout the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the rate of complementary and alternative medicine use in this population is high, it is not clear what predicts its use, in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   A cross-sectional survey, using a structured interview, was undertaken among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attending diabetic clinics in three census regions in Taiwan, between July 2006 and February 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survey instrument, derived from a review of Taiwanese and international literature, was developed using the Health Belief Model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   A total of 326 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were interviewed (87·4% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, complementary and alternative medicine use was associated with a history of its use, a positive attitude towards it, stronger health beliefs about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine in treating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a higher degree of self-care activities by the individual and a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:   The results of this study indicate that complementary and alternative medicine use in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is influenced by people's experience, beliefs, attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine, and their behaviour towards disease management rather than their demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nurses and healthcare professionals should consider the patient's background, health history, health beliefs and cultural background when planning specific strategies designed to modify lifestyle </plain></SENT>
