<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the fermented ginseng extract (FGE) in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> murine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FGE was provided to male C57BL/ksJ-db/db mice for 8 weeks at 0.1% (w/w) dose in contrast to water for the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential anti-diabetic mechanisms were investigated with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, serum adiponectin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin secretion assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, the FGE group had lower levels of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after 6 and 9 h fasting, HbA1c, and the area under the curve in an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and higher levels of adiponectin and serum insulin (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FGE group had higher levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter protein 2 mRNAs, a lower level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) (p &lt; 0.05), and less lymphocytes in pancreas than the control group had </plain></SENT>
