<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We screened the renal transcriptome of db/db and db/m mice for differentially expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts that encode secreted proteins with human orthologs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether elevated urine levels of the orthologous proteins correlated with diminished glomerular filtration rate was tested in a cross-sectional study of n = 56 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 36 putative biomarker genes in db/db kidneys: 31 upregulated and 5 downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urinary protein levels of six selected candidates (endothelin-1, lipocalin-2, transforming growth factor-β, growth and differentiation factor-15, interleukin-6, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1) were elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with subnormal glomerular filtration rate (i.e., &lt;90 ml·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)), independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, age, sex, race, and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> and angiotensin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, urinary levels of fibroblast growth factor were not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A composite variable of urine albumin and any of the six candidate markers was associated with subnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate more closely than albumin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, urinary endothelin-1, growth and differentiation factor-15, and interleukin-6 were associated with a marker of proximal tubule damage, N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-β-d-glucosaminidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that gene expression profiling in diabetic mouse kidney can complement existing proteomic-based approaches for renal biomarker discovery in humans </plain></SENT>
