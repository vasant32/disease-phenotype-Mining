<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the relationships between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management self-efficacy and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management behaviors and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A convenience sample of 223 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ≥25 years old, who sought care at the National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Center in Amman, Jordan, was enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A structured interview and medical records provided the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The instruments included a sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management self-efficacy scale, and a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management behaviors scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was used as an index for glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analyses are presented as proportions, means (±S.D.), odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals obtained from logistic regressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diet self-efficacy and diet self-management behaviors predicted better glycemic control, whereas insulin use was a statistically significant predictor for poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, subjects with higher self-efficacy reported better self-management behaviors in diet, exercise, blood sugar testing, and taking medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings showed that more than half of the subjects did not have their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under control and that only 42% had attended <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of subjects did not have their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> controlled; their self-efficacy was low, and they had suboptimal self-management behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, strategies to enhance and promote self-efficacy and self-management behaviors for patients are essential components of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, behavioral counseling and skill-building interventions are critical for the patients to become confident and be able to manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
