<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Legume consumption has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the type of legume is a modifier of its effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two Spanish dry bean varieties-white ('Almonga') and cream ('Curruquilla')-were analyzed and used in a postprandial study in type 2 diabetics to assess <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and triacylglycerol in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 'Curruquilla' variety had higher total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17164">stachyose</z:chebi>, mainly), trypsin inhibitors and lectin content than 'Almonga' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The canning liquid was discarded prior to the analysis and the bean consumption by the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The canning process reduced the total α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi> content (&gt;50%), practically eliminated trypsin inhibitors, and no lectin content was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After bean consumption, maximum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was obtained at 60 min and was three times lower than that in bread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After bean intake, maximum insulin was produced 60 min with 'Almonga' and occurred later (90 min) with 'Curruquilla' and bread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 'Almonga' intake, the area under the curve response of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> was 14% lower compared to bread (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 'Almonga' and 'Curruquilla' are similar in the content of the nutritional but not in that of the antinutritional components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both beans showed similar effects on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin in type 2 diabetics and marked differences compared to those of bread in terms of magnitude and time course, but only 'Almonga' rendered a significant reduction in the triglyceridemic response </plain></SENT>
