<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population of 2018 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CKD stage was classified according to the eGFR and the urinary albumin excretion levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was found in 1420 (70%) of the patients, and the proportion of subjects showing a blood pressure &lt; 130/80 mmHg was 31% at the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the mean blood pressure was approximately 130/75 mmHg, the rate of patients with a blood pressure of &lt; 130/80 mmHg became limited to 41-50% during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> required for treatment was significantly higher at the endpoint (2.0 ± 1.3) than at the baseline (1.6 ± 1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it increased with the progression of the CKD stage at both the baseline and the endpoint of the observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of subjects who did not achieve the blood pressure target was found to increase in the group demonstrating the later stage of CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> was common in the patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and increased with the progression of CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although powerful combination therapy using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> is considered necessary for the strict control of blood pressure, this became difficult in individuals who were in advanced stages as graded based on the eGFR and the urinary albumin excretion levels </plain></SENT>
