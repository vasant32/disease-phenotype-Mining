<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies in Japanese populations recently identified common variants in the KCNQ1 gene to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of these variants within KCNQ1 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Dutch population, investigated their effects on insulin secretion and metabolic traits and on the risk of developing complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The KCNQ1 variants rs151290, rs2237892, and rs2237895 were genotyped in a total of 4620 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and 5285 healthy controls from the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on macrovascular complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were available in a subset of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association between genotype and insulin secretion/action was assessed in the additional sample of 335 individuals who underwent a hyperglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the genotyped KCNQ1 variants were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our Dutch population, and the association of rs151290 was the strongest (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.35, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk C-allele of rs151290 was nominally associated with reduced first-phase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, while the non-risk T-allele of rs2237892 was significantly correlated with increased second-phase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (p = 0.025 and 0.0016, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the risk C-allele of rs2237892 was associated with higher <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and total cholesterol levels (p = 0.015 and 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence for an association of KCNQ1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Common variants in the KCNQ1 gene are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Dutch population, which can be explained at least in part by an effect on insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data suggest that KCNQ1 is also associated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
