<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current recommendation for glycemic control based on HbA1c values has been widely accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, HbA1c values depend on the lifespan of erythrocytes and the assay methods used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the case of a patient with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with unusual falling of HbA1c due to interference from dapsone treatment for leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was a 52-year-old man, who was diagnosed with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> 5 years previously and who had been treated in our hospital in the past 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycemia was controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the 3-years follow-up period, HbA1c dropped significantly during the addition of dapsone treatment, although plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels were raised after discontinuation of dapsone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With rechallenge of dapsone usage, HbA1c decreased again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that dapsone may be the cause of artificially low HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other measurements to monitor glycemic control should be considered when dapsone is used for the treatment of concurrent disorders, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and pneumocystis jiroveci <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
