<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As yet, no method is available for this purpose, which could be applied to in situ human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal and in vitro studies have documented that <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> infusion could improve the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we have tested whether a similar approach could discriminate diabetic and non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, human isolated islets readily incorporated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, 243 manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) examinations were reviewed, including 41 examinations which were run on 24 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 202 examinations which were run on 119 normoglycemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that MEMRI discriminates type 2 diabetics from non-diabetic patients, based on the signal enhancement of pancreas </plain></SENT>
