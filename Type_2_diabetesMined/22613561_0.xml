<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 844 type 2 diabetic patients with 4-year prospective study were examined using a case-control methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And 404 cases with ischemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 440 cases without ischemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The -866G&gt;A polymorphism in UCP2 was genotyped by TaqMan MGB probe method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The -866G&gt;A SNP in UCP2 was significantly associated with diabetic ischemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR]= 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.68 to1.31; P &lt; 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed for baseline cases of IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratification by sex confirmed an allelic association with IS in women, whereas no association was observed in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The A allele of the -866G&gt;A variant of UCP2 was associated with increased risk of IS in Chinese diabetic women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a 4-year prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of other common IS risk factors </plain></SENT>
