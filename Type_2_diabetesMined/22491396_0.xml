<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lay members of the public with existing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> volunteered as peer supporters (termed type 2 trainers) for participants at high risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of type 2 trainer recruitment, training, and retention was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January and September 2009, 1500 potential type 2 trainers with existing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were contacted and 168 (11%) expressed an interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this group, 26 type 2 trainers were appointed to begin training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> completed 7 training seminars, covering <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention, nutrition, physical activity, listening skills, motivation, and goal planning </plain></SENT>
