<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to summarize data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to examine risk of overall and site-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with TZD use in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched 12 key biomedical databases and seven grey literature sources up to June 2011, without language restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed separate meta-analyses according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site and study design, comparing ever-use to never-use of TZDs, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search yielded 1338 unique citations; we included four RCT, seven cohort and nine nested case-control studies, contributing data from 2.5 million people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimates from observational studies suggested any TZD use was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal (pooled RR: 0.93, 95%CI 0.87-1.00, P=0.04, I(2)=30%), lung (pooled RR: 0.91, 95%CI 0.84-0.98, P=0.02, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (I(2))=35%) and breast (pooled RR: 0.89, 95%CI 0.81-0.98, P=0.02, I(2)=44%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk of overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with TZD use was not significantly modified in RCTs (pooled RR: 0.92, 95%CI 0.79-1.07, P=0.26, I(2)=0%) or observational studies (pooled OR: 0.95, 95%CI 0.78-1.16, P=0.63, I(2)=70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> use was, however, associated with a decreased risk of overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (colorectal, lung, breast, prostate and renal sub-sites combined) in observational studies (pooled RR: 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99, P=0.009, I(2)=0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that use of TZDs is associated with a modest but significantly decreased risk of lung, colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were limited by the paucity of studies designed to answer our research question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of TZD use, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk factors and potential confounders is required </plain></SENT>
