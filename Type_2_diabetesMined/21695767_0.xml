<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) has been shown to result in medical complications on several organ systems including the kidneys, eyes, cardiovascular system, and most recently described the brain, including the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence that females are disproportionately affected by these medical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain volume reductions have also been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the relationships among T2DM, gender, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, and hippocampal volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participant groups consisted of 40 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adults with T2DM and 47 lean adults, group-matched on age, gender, race, and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each participant underwent medical examination including a standard panel of blood tests, a magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show that there is a gender difference in the association of T2DM and hippocampal volumes: diabetic women are most affected despite having better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control than their male counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although females with T2DM had disproportionately lower <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> as well as better <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, neither of these results explained why females with T2DM had the smallest hippocampal volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These important findings indicate that in addition to the higher rate of traditional medical complication, females with T2DM are likely to suffer more brain complications than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations, if supported by larger studies, suggest that in the future gender could be considered when customizing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
