<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a population-based study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), osteoprotegerin, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, osteocalcin, CrossLaps, alkaline phosphatase, and bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and the proximal femur were measured in 382 Iranian postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In multiple logistic regression analysis, lower osteocalcin and CrossLaps levels were associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) of having type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> when adjustments were made for age, hs-CRP, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, BMD, and markers of bone metabolism [OR 5.17, CI (2.66-10.04), p &lt; 0.0001 and OR 2.51, CI (1.37-4.61), p = 0.003, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, lower alkaline phosphatase levels were associated with a lower OR of having type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> [OR 0.28, CI (0.15-0.52), p &lt; 0.0001] in regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between serum osteocalcin levels of those with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> components, low osteocalcin levels had significant associations with elevated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [OR 1.89, CI (1.16-3.07), p = 0.010] and elevated waist circumference [OR 2.53, CI (1.13-5.67), p = 0.024] in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, serum osteocalcin was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> as the components of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since CrossLaps and alkaline phosphatase levels were independently associated with the presence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, the unique contribution of osteocalcin in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism could not be concluded </plain></SENT>
