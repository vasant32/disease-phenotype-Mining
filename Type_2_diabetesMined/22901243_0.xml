<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, YKL-40 may play a role in pathogenesis of CHD in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether plasma YKL-40 concentration can predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a prospective, observational study PATIENTS: 628 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited between July 1996 and June 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma YKL-40 concentrations were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cohort was followed-up until 31 December 2008, when vital status and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis and concordance statistics were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 153 (24.36%) mortalities, including 48 participants (7.64%) who died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants with higher plasma YKL-40 (defied with a level above the median of 87.5 μg/l) had an increased risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for confounding variables, the hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in participants with higher plasma YKL-40 were 1.97 (95% CI: 1.31-2.95, P &lt; 0.01) and 2.45 (95% CI: 1.11-5.37, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results remained similar after adjustment for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Concordance statistics revealed that plasma YKL-40 concentration significantly increases the predictive power for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in different models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma YKL-40 concentration is an independent predictor of 10-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further investigations on the role of YKL-40 in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </plain></SENT>
