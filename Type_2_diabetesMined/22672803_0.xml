<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the analogs exhibited excellent inhibitory activities (IC50&lt;44 nM) against <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The structure-activity relationship (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e>) of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46908">imidazopyridine</z:chebi> analogs and the binding mode of analog 23 in the catalytic domain of GSK3β, based on our X-ray crystallography study, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, analog 28, which was selected as a potential drug candidate for treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, exhibited excellent GSK3β inhibition, pharmacokinetic profiles and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering effect in mouse </plain></SENT>
