<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies done so far have given conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined the role of PON1 genetic variants and PON1 activity in the development of CAD in North-West Indian Punjabis, a distinct ethnic group, having high incidence of both CAD and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>300 angiographically proven CAD with type 2 diabetics and 250 type 2 diabetics with no clinically evident CAD were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum PON1 activity and genotyping of coding (Q192R, L55M) and promoter (-909G/C, -162A/G, -108C/T) region polymorphisms were carried out and haplotypes were determined using PHASE software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum PON1 activity was significantly lower in CAD with type 2 diabetics as compared to diabetics alone (51.0 vs. 114.2nmol/min/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression model after adjusting for confounding variables, lower PON1 activity was found to be significantly associated with CAD risk in type 2 diabetics with OR being 16.8 (95% CI: 10.2-27.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lower serum PON1 activity, irrespective of genotypes and haplotypes is a risk factor for development of CAD in North-West Indian Punjabis with type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
