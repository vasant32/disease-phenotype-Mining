<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test whether there is an association between fasting ApoB48 level, a marker of the residual presence of intestinally derived TRLs <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, thought to be highly atherogenic, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in type 2 diabetic patients independent of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 87 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 34 with asymptomatic PAD (ankle/brachial index &lt; 0.9) and 53 without PAD matched on age (±2 years), gender and BMI (±2 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma fasting ApoB48 was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with PAD had significantly higher ApoB48 levels (1.529 ± 1.253 vs 1.095 ± 0.667 μg/ml p =��0.04) than those without PAD independent of major confounders, such as duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking status, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fasting ApoB48 was independently associated with asymptomatic PAD in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
