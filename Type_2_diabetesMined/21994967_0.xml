<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that exercise and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> have an additive effect on insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to examine the effects of three different hypoxic/exercise (Hy Ex) trials on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: Eight male type 2 diabetics completed 60 min of hypoxic [mean (sem) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> = ∼14.7 (0.2)%] exercise at 90% of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> threshold [Hy Ex(60); 49 (1) W] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients completed an additional two hypoxic trials of equal work, lasting 40 min [Hy Ex(40); 70 (1) W] and 20 min [Hy Ex(20); 140 (12) W] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> rate of appearance and rate of disappearance were determined using the one-compartment minimal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA(IR)), fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index and β-cell function (HOMA(β-cell)) were calculated at 24 and 48 h after trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peak <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> rate of appearance was highest during Hy Ex(20) [8.89 (0.56) mg/kg · min, P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HOMA(IR) and fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index were improved in the 24 and 48 h after Hy Ex(60) and Hy Ex(40) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HOMA(IR) decreased 24 h after Hy Ex(20) (P &lt; 0.05) and returned to baseline values at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-intensity exercise in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (Hy Ex(60) and Hy Ex(40)) stimulates <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>- and moderate-term improvements in insulin sensitivity that were less apparent in Hy Ex(20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that exercise duration and not total work completed has a greater influence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and moderate-term <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
