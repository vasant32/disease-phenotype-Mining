<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed DiAlert as a targeted group-based intervention aimed to promote intrinsic motivation and action planning for lifestyle changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in first degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>.The main objective of the pilot of the DiAlert intervention was to assess fidelity, feasibility and acceptability prior to starting the randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals with a family history of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were self-identified and screened for eligibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DiAlert consists of two group sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Feasibility, fidelity, acceptability and self-reported perceptions and behavioral determinants were evaluated in a pre-post study using questionnaires and observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Determinants of behavior change were analyzed using paired-samples t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DiAlert was delivered to two groups of first degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (N = 9 and N = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Feasibility and fidelity were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the DiAlert group sessions were positively evaluated (8.0 on a scale of 1 to 10) by participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intervention did not impact perceived susceptibility or worry about personal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Action planning with regard to changing diet and physical activity increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DiAlert proved feasible and was well-accepted by participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Positive trends in action planning indicate increased likelihood of actual behavior change following DiAlert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Testing the effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial is imperative.Trial registrationNetherlands National Trial Register (NTR): NTR2036 </plain></SENT>
