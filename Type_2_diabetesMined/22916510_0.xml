<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-one men with type, 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopulmonary disease</z:e> were recruited and divided into 28 non-current smokers and 13 current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received lung function tests and cardiopulmonary exercise testing using tracings of the flow-volume loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exercise capacity was compared using the percentage of predicted oxygen uptake at maximal workload (%VO2max) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Respiratory variables and inspiratory capacity (IC) were compared between the two groups at rest and at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of maximum workload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference in lung function tests between the two groups, venous carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) levels were significantly higher in current smokers. %VO2max was inversely correlated with CO-Hb levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changing patterns in respiratory rate, respiratory equivalent and IC were significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current smokers had rapid breathing, a greater respiratory equivalent and a limited increase in IC during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking diminishes the increase in dynamic IC in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As this effect of smoking on dynamic changes in lung volume will exacerbate dynamic hyperinflation in cases complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, physicians should consider smoking habits and lung function when evaluating exercise capacity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
