<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, longitudinal studies of these variables are rare, and their results are somewhat conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study objective was to compare DS and DRD as longitudinal predictors of medication adherence, self-care behavior, and glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSPrimary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reported DS, DRD, and other variables at baseline were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medication adherence, self-care behaviors (diet, physical activity, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing), and glycemic control (HbA(1c)) were assessed 6 months later (n = 253) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analyses were used to model behavioral and medical outcomes as a function of baseline confounders, DS, and DD.RESULTSAdjusted cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses yielded very similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the latter, only DS were significantly associated with future diet behavior (P = 0.049), physical activity (P = 0.001), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only DRD predicted future glycemic control (P &lt; 0.001) and medication adherence (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONSDistress-outcome associations seem to vary by type of distress under consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only DS predicts future lifestyle-oriented self-management behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only DRD predicts glycemic control, perhaps by decreasing medication adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical assessment and intervention should encompass both types of distress, unless the goal is to narrowly target a highly specific outcome </plain></SENT>
