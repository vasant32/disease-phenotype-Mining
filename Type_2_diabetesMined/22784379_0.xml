<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim This paper aims to explore and analyse mental healthcare staff's (MHCS) knowledge and experiences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care for persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are a range of studies concerning the increased risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> among persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>, and the need for healthy lifestyle interventions to prevent the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MHCS are often trusted and have regular follow-ups with the patients, and their attitudes and actions often play an important role for the person's care behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is still little documentation of their experiences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A qualitative, explorative design was used, collecting data through semi-structured interviews with 12 MHCS working in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> outpatient care in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed with qualitative content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings Three categories emerged and provide a deeper understanding of how staff were aware of the risks of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among their patients and therefore performed lifestyle interventions to promote these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, they lacked knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care and simultaneously felt a lack of training among <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nurses to adapt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care to suit persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who were overconfident in their ability to manage <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care reported to have experienced most difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cooperation among those involved in these persons' health was considered necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Implications <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> care for persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> could improve if knowledge of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was increased among MHCS and training in how to adapt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care to persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> was enlarged among <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A challenge for nurses is to see how the care of different illnesses and support given by the family and others affect the persons total life situation and health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Healthcare plans and cooperation among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those involved in these persons' health is necessary for this </plain></SENT>
