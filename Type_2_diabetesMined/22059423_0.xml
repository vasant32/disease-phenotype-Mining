<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spectrum is that of tempo--the rate at which beta cell function is lost over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combination of beta cell up-regulation (insulin demand, largely determined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>) and the genetically-determined immune response to it ('<z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>') determines tempo, ranging from slow to fast with every variant in between </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is good evidence that people who go on to develop type 1 (fast) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are, like those who develop type 2 (slow <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), insulin resistant, and overwhelming evidence that body mass plays a key role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevention of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may lie in weight restriction from an early age </plain></SENT>
