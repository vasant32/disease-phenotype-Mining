<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is rapidly increasing in industrialized countries and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> accounts for 90% of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is a major pathophysiological factor in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, occurring mainly in muscle, adipose tissues, and liver leading to reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and utilization and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and rising incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> emphasized the need to explore new molecular targets and strategies to develop novel antihyperglycemic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> 1B) has recently emerged as a promising molecular level legitimate therapeutic target in the effective management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> 1B, a cytosolic nonreceptor PTPase, has been implicated as a negative regulator of insulin signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> 1B inhibitors would increase insulin sensitivity by blocking the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> 1B-mediated negative insulin signaling pathway and might be an attractive target for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With X-ray crystallography and NMR-based fragment screening, the binding interactions of several classes of inhibitors have been elucidated, which could help the design of future <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> 1B inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The drug discovery research in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> 1B is a challenging area to work with and many pharmaceutical organizations and academic research laboratories are focusing their research toward the development of potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> 1B inhibitors which would prove to be a milestone for the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
