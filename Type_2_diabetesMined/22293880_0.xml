<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adequate persistence of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment is highly important to achieve proper glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the persistence of initial treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or sulphonylureas in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: The study was performed among diabetic patients (n=256,384) who were with newly prescribed oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or sulphonylureas) between 2007 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For making comparison, patients with newly prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> therapy (with and without percutaneous coronary intervention) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The database of the Hungarian National Health Insurance Fund Administration was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 1-year persistence of initial treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, sulphonylureas or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>/sulphonylurea combination was 47.7%, 45.4% and 55.8%, respectively, which was significantly better than the persistence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy (26.3%) but worse than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention (73.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the sulphonylurea group there was a tendency of better persistence of treatment with the "modified-release" tablets at 12 months compared to the conventional sulphonylureas (47.8 vs. 42.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The persistence of therapy using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1000 mg - 60 tablets was significantly better (60.4%) at 12 months than that of other forms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy with lower doses and smaller boxes (with fewer tablets) analyzed together (47.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of initial treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or sulphonylureas is far from optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Better diabetic care and continuous patient education should be encouraged to achieve higher persistence of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
