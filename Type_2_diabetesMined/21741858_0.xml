<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MetS is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate possible associations of the scarcely investigated rs7204609 (C/T) polymorphism, as well as the rs9939609 (A/T) polymorphism, with MetS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients from Southern Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 236 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age: 60.0 ± 10.3 years; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration: 12.7 ± 8.2 years; 53.4% women) were genotyped for the FTO rs7204609 and rs9939609 polymorphisms (ABI PRISM 7000 Real-Time PCR System) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, and nutritional evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MetS was defined according to the 2009-Joint Interim Statement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carriers of C allele of the rs7204609 polymorphism (CT/CC genotypes, n = 35) were at increased risk for the presence of MetS (odds ratio [OR] = 4.56; 95% CI: 1.04 to 19.9), elevated waist circumference (OR = 8.66; 95% CI: 1.12 to 66.7), BMI: ≥ 30 kg/m(2) (OR = 3.71; 95% CI: 1.71 to 8.02), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (OR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.88), adjusted for gender and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (P &lt; .05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> models) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rs9939609 polymorphism was not associated with MetS, elevated waist circumference or BMI, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Daily energy and nutrient intakes did not differ according to the presence of the polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The C allele of the rs7204609 polymorphism in the FTO gene increased the chance for the presence of MetS, especially central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, independently of energy and nutrient intakes in this sample of type 2 diabetic patients from Southern Brazil </plain></SENT>
