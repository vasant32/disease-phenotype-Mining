<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Jordan, prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (17.1%) is twice that of the United States (7.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the contribution of the promoter variant rs266729 (-11377C&gt;G) of ADIPOQ gene as a risk factor for diabetic patients in Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from blood samples for patients and controls .Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to genotype this variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 420 type 2 diabetic patients and 230 controls were successfully genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed a significant genotypic (p=0.00001) and allelic (p=0.01) association with variant in the diabetic patients as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that ADIPOQ gene plays a major role in increasing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, at least in the Jordanian Arab population </plain></SENT>
