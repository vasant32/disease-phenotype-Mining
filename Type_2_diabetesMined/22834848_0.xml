<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe cardiometabolic risk among a sample of American Indian women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> and describe the women's knowledge, risk perception for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and self-efficacy beliefs related to preventing these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Mixed methods, cross-sectional, exploratory, descriptive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Four campuses within one American Indian tribal health care system in a southwestern state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A purposeful sample of 22 self-identified American Indian women with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Qualitative interview data were subjected to content analysis, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative questionnaire data and biophysiologic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of participants (13 of 21) were classified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and 13 of 18 women were found to be insulin resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, the women had high levels of knowledge related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and high risk perception, but low self-efficacy related to preventing cardiometabolic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overarching theme from the in-depth interviews, struggling to change lifestyle behaviors while doubting prevention is possible, encompassed four categories that provided further illumination into participants' risk perceptions and self-efficacy beliefs: concerns, control, beliefs/attitudes, and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High levels of knowledge and risk perception do not necessarily promote increased self-efficacy to prevent cardiometabolic disease among American Indian women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings indicate the need to further explore women's self-efficacy beliefs in the context of American Indian culture prior to developing interventions aimed at increasing self-efficacy to prevent or delay type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> are at increased risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, independent of a diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
