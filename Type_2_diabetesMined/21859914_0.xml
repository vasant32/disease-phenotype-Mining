<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe demographic and clinical characteristics associated with self-reported receipt of tests and measurements recommended by the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) for children and youths with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 1514 SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth study participants who completed a survey about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quality-of-care measures were based on <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> guidelines for eye examinations and glycohemoglobin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c [HbA1c]), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, and blood pressure measurements, and a composite variable of these 5 indicators was created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association of selected demographic and clinical characteristics with the reported receipt of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recommended tests and measurements according to age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 95% of the participants reported having their blood pressure checked at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or most visits, 88% had <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels measured, 83% had kidney function tested, 68% underwent HbA1c testing, and 66% underwent an eye examination, in accordance with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants aged 18 years or older, particularly those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, tended to have fewer tests of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age and family income emerged as important correlates of overall quality of care in multivariate models; older age and lower income were associated with not meeting guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although there was relatively good adherence to <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>-recommended guidelines for most indicators, efforts are needed to improve rates of HbA1c testing and eye examinations, particularly among older youths </plain></SENT>
