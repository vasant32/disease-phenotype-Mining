<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A pilot study was conducted among 222 individuals with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (79% non-Hispanic white, 21% other) and 43 with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (28% non-Hispanic white, 72% other), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of &gt; 5 years duration (mean duration 6.8 years) who participated in the SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was assessed using non-mydriatic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography of both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 17% for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 42% for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.50, 95% CI 0.58-3.88; P = 0.40 adjusted for age, duration, gender, race/ethnicity, parental education and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was significantly higher among those with any diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (adjusted mean 79 mmol/mol, 9.4%) vs. no diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (adjusted mean 70 mmol/mol, 8.6%) (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was also significantly higher among those with any diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (adjusted mean 107.2 mg/dl) compared with those without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (adjusted mean 97.9 mg/dl) (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in contemporary young individuals was substantial, particularly among minority youth and those with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
