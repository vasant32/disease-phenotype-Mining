<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined this association in three cohorts of US adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We followed 29,776 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, 1990-2006), 61,791 women in the Nurses' Health Study I (NHS I, 1996-2008) and 76,868 women in NHS II (1993-2005), who were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean baseline ages for participants from the HPFS and NHS I and II were 56.4, 61.3 and 38.1 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ADM use and other covariates were assessed at baseline and updated every 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model was used, and HRs were pooled together across the three cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 1,644,679 person-years of follow-up, we documented 6,641 new cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ADM use was associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cohorts in age-adjusted models (pooled HR 1.68 [95% CI 1.27, 2.23]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association was attenuated after adjustment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors and histories of high cholesterol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (1.30 [1.14, 1.49]), and further attenuated by controlling for updated BMI (1.17 [1.09, 1.25]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants (mainly <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi>) were both associated with an elevated risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with pooled multivariate-adjusted HRs of 1.10 (1.00, 1.22) and 1.26 (1.11, 1.42), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that ADM users had a moderately elevated risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> compared with non-users, even after adjustment for BMI </plain></SENT>
