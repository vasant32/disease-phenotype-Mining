<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and vitamin B₁₂ levels in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of medical records of patients treated between 2003 and 2009 at Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, in both ambulatory primary care and endocrinology clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study cohort consisted of 706 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who were 20 to 93 years old (mean age, 63 ± 13) and had a mean body mass index of 33.1 kg/m² </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 42% were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and 34% had been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> had statistically significant lower vitamin B₁₂ levels than those not receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (P&lt;.0001; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -220 to -84 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found between users and nonusers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in regard to 25(OH)D levels when adjusted for variables (P = .297; 95% CI for mean difference = -0.7 to 2.2 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> use did not adversely affect successful treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> in this patient population as a whole, nor did it affect the subgroup with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> (P = .956) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> had statistically significant lower baseline 25(OH)D levels in comparison with those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, when adjustments were made for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables (P = .003; 95% CI = 0.7 to 3.5 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms the higher prevalence of vitamin B₁₂ deficiency in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study also suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> is not a clinical concern among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> does not negatively affect treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
