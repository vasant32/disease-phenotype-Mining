<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of low-dose aspirin therapy on primary prevention of atherosclerotic events in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Japanese Primary Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> With Aspirin for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (JPAD) trial was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial conducted throughout Japan that enrolled 2,539 type 2 diabetic patients without a history of atherosclerotic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to the aspirin group (81 mg/day or 100 mg/day) or the nonaspirin group and followed for a median of 4.37 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were atherosclerotic events of fatal and nonfatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis included 2,523 patients who had serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1,373 patients with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m(2), the incidence of primary end points was significantly lower in the aspirin group than in the nonaspirin group (aspirin, 30/661; nonaspirin, 55/712; hazard ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.36-0.88]; P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-dose aspirin therapy did not reduce primary end points in patients with eGFR â‰¥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (aspirin, 9/248; nonaspirin, 11/270; 0.94 [0.38-2.3]) or those with eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (aspirin, 29/342; nonaspirin, 19/290; 1.3 [0.76-2.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated a significant interaction between mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and aspirin (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a differential effect of low-dose aspirin therapy in diabetic patients with eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
