<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVETo describe the prevalence and associated risk factors for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) within a multiethnic population at presentation to a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic in South Africa.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSRetinal photography was conducted using a nonmydriatic digital camera without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011499'>mydriasis</z:hpo> and graded by one of three senior graders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between any DR, referable DR, and clinical risk factors.RESULTSA total of 1,537 persons with type 1 and 3,978 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of any DR in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 35.2% (background DR 26% and referable DR 9.2%) and in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 20.5% (14.1 and 6.4%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there was an increased risk of any DR in Asian Indians, whereas the risk of referable DR was increased for indigenous Africans compared with Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the risk was increased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-Caucasians compared with Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and elevated HbA(1c) were independently associated with any and referable DR in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with the addition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when adjusted for age at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sex, and ethnicity.CONCLUSIONSThe prevalence of DR in this population from South Africa was similar to that reported globally; however, ethnic differences were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and poor glycemic control were the strongest risk factors associated with any and referable DR in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
