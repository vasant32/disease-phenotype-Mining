<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The evidence of the relationship between fiber intake and control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is mixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if an increase in dietary fiber affects glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomized studies published from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 2010, that involved an increase in dietary fiber intake as an intervention, evaluated HbA1c and/or fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as an outcome, and used human participants with known type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were selected for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall mean difference of fiber versus placebo was a reduction of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 0.85 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.46-1.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dietary fiber as an intervention also had an effect on HbA1c over placebo, with an overall mean difference of a decrease in HbA1c of 0.26% (95% CI, 0.02-0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, an intervention involving fiber supplementation for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> can reduce fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that increasing dietary fiber in the diet of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is beneficial and should be encouraged as a disease management strategy </plain></SENT>
