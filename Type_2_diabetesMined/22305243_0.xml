<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the effect of tactile massage versus relaxation exercises on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, at primary-health-care centres in Stockholm county </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The study was carried out as a parallel-arm clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and HbA1c of 6-8%, aged 35-75, with oral anti-diabetic treatment were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 26 and 27 attendants in the TM and relaxation group, respectively, entered the study and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The attendants were offered one weekly session of TM or the use of relaxation exercises at least once weekly for a total of 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HRQoL was measured using the SF-36 questionnaire at baseline, after 10 weeks of therapy and 3 months after the completion of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Owing to multiple comparisons the level of statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.01, and values of p&gt;0.01 and &lt;0.05 were regarded as borderline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One difference over time between the groups was reaching a borderline value in favour of the relaxation group, i.e. the scale of "Role functioning, physical" (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings in this study, we conclude that stress-relieving techniques with TM or relaxation CD have limited, if any, beneficial effects on health-related quality of life in Swedish-born patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We cannot, however, rule out that specific patient groups with higher levels of perceived stress could show benefits with this kind of treatment </plain></SENT>
