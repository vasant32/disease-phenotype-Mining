<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is ongoing discussion on how best to screen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggest that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004924'>abnormal oral glucose tolerance</z:hpo> test (OGTT) is better than fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in predicting cardiovascular mortality, which is largely determined by macrovascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between screening methods for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and indices of vascular damage in young individuals at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals (n = 76, average age 38 ± 6 years) were screened for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by measuring fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, HbA1c and by performing the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indices of early vascular damage, including the central augmentation index (cAIx) and pulse pressure amplification (PPA), were assessed by pulse wave analysis (Sphygmocor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of vascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Central SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (BPs) were best predicted by age and by peripheral BP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>cAIx was independently predicted by age (r = +0.324, P = 0.008), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (r = +0.294, P = 0.011) and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values of the OGTT (r = +0.390, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PPA was independently predicted by age (r = -0.445, P &lt; 0.001) and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value of the OGTT (r = -0.353, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 2-h value of the OGTT was superior to fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and HbA1c in predicting cAIx and PPA in young individuals at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular mortality is largely determined by macrovascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and these data suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening by OGTT may help to identify those individuals with the greatest risk of future vascular complications </plain></SENT>
