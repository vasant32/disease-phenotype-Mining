<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods  Cross-sectional data from 3305 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were obtained from a baseline assessment of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry at a general hospital in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Centre for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale and Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> scale were used to measure depressive symptoms and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modified Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risks for poor glycaemic control across the quartiles of Centre for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale and Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> scale scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results  The average age of the participants was 64.9 years and the average HbA(1c) level was 58.1 mmol/mol (7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale scores ≥ 16) were reported by 27.8% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These scores significantly correlated with Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> scale scores (r = 0.4354, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> distress, but not depressive symptoms, was significantly associated with higher HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risks for poor glycaemic control (HbA(1c) ≥ 64 mmol/mol; 8.0%), when adjusted for age, sex, BMI, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was 67% higher among patients with Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> scale scores in the highest quartile (≥ 26.25) compared with those in the lowest quartile (0-3.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  A significant association between glycaemic control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress, but not depressive symptoms, was observed in Japanese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
