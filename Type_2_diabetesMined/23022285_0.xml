<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thiazolidinedione (TZD) therapy has been associated with an increased risk of bone fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in rodents have led to a model in which decreased bone quality in response to TZDs is due to a competition of lineage commitment between osteoblasts (OBs) and adipocytes (ADs) for a common precursor cell, resulting in decreased OB numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to investigate the effects of TZD exposure on OB-AD lineage determination from primary human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) both in vitro and in vivo from nondiabetic subjects and patients with type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our experimental design included 2 phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phase 1 was an in vitro study of TZD effects on the differentiation of hBMSCs into OBs and ADs in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase 2 was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effects of 6-month <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment in vivo on hBMSC differentiation using AD/OB colony forming unit assays in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, TZDs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>) enhanced the adipogenesis of hBMSCs, whereas neither altered OB differentiation or function as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity, gene expression, and mineralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability of TZDs to enhance adipogenesis occurred at a specific time/stage of the differentiation process, and pretreating with TZDs did not further enhance adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, 6-month TZD treatment decreased OB precursors, increased AD precursors, and increased total colony number in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that TZD exposure in vitro potently stimulates adipogenesis but does not directly alter OB differentiation/mineralization or lineage commitment from hBMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, TZD treatment in type 2 diabetic patients results in decreased osteoblastogenesis from hBMSCs compared with placebo, indicating an indirect negative effect on OBs and suggesting an alternative model by which TZDs might negatively regulate bone quality </plain></SENT>
