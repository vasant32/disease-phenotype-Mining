<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Weight management is considered a key therapeutic strategy in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> or body mass index (BMI) reduction on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the economic impact of change in BMI among patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> from the Spanish healthcare system perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: The ECOBIM study is an observational, non-interventional study in which data on BMI change and costs incurred by patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were collected cross-sectionally and retrospectively for a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Generalized linear mixed models were applied to estimate the effects of (i) BMI change in general (one-slope model); (ii) BMI gain and no BMI gain (two-slope model); and (iii) BMI gain and no BMI gain among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (four-slope model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: We studied 738 patients with a mean (SD) age of 66 (11) years and BMI of 30.6 (5.2) kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the 12-month study period, 41.2% of patients gained BMI (BMI gainers) and 58.8% experienced either loss (52.2%) or no change (6.6%) in BMI (non-BMI gainers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-unit gain (or loss) in BMI was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) associated with a 2.4% cost increase (or decrease) [one-slope model] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Every unit gain in BMI was associated with a 20.0% increase in costs among BMI gainers while losing one unit was associated with an 8.0% decrease in costs among non-BMI gainers (two-slope model, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The economic benefit associated with reducing one BMI unit was 9.4% cost decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 2.7% in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (4-slope model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: An increase in BMI among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with increased 1-year direct healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A reduction in BMI was associated with appreciable short-term economic benefits, especially in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
