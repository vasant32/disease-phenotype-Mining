<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although no significant difference was observed in the genotypic frequencies (P = 0.657), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients carried a significantly higher number of A alleles at the -592 position, 25.6% (P &lt; 0.001, odds ratio 0.887, 95% CI 0.670-1.184) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were detected in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of CC-genotype patients and controls (P = 0.025), age and waist-hip ratio of CA patients and controls (P â‰¤ 0.001), and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.045) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (P = 0.049) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum IL-10 level was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism was significantly associated with disease incidence and its biochemical manifestations </plain></SENT>
