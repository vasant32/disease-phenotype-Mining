<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Unlike visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the association between subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related morbidity is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we assessed whether this variability can be explained by a putative favorable, distinct association between abdominal superficial SAT (SSAT) (absolute amount or its proportion) and cardiometabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 73 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 58 years, 83% were men) and cross-sectionally analyzed fat distribution at S1-L5, L5-L4, and L3-L2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients completed food frequency questionnaires, and subgroups had 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 24-h ambulatory electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women had higher %SSAT (37 vs. 23% in men; P &lt; 0.001) despite a similar mean waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.046) and HbA(1c) (P = 0.006) were both lower with increased tertile of absolute SSAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In regression models adjusted for age, waist circumference, and classes of medical treatments used in this patient population, increased %SSAT was significantly associated with decreased HbA(1c) (β = -0.317; P = 0.013), decreased daytime ambulatory blood pressure (β = -0.426; P = 0.008), and increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (β = 0.257; P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, increased percent of deep SAT (DSAT) was associated with increased HbA(1c) (β = 0.266; P = 0.040) and poorer heart rate variability parameters (P = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although total fat and energy intake were not correlated with fat tissue distribution, increased intake of trans fat tended to be associated with total SAT (r = 0.228; P = 0.05) and DSAT (r = 0.20; P = 0.093), but not with SSAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal SAT is composed of two subdepots that associate differently with cardiometabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher absolute and relative distribution of fat in abdominal SSAT may signify beneficial cardiometabolic effects in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
