<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined trends of insulin use among US adults aged ≥40 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System collected annually during 1995-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin use was assessed by self-report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Log-linear regression analyses with a robust error variance estimator were performed to estimate the prevalence, prevalence ratios, and their 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall crude and age-standardized proportion of insulin use decreased from 35% and 36% in 1995 to 23% and 22% in 2007, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education attainment, body mass index, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, the overall prevalence decreased from 33% to 22% (P&lt;.0001 for linear trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decreasing rates were similar across sex (P=.23 for interaction between sex and survey year) and race/ethnicity (P=.35 for interaction between race/ethnicity and survey year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proportion of insulin use decreased from 1995 to 2007 among US adults aged ≥40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Continuing efforts may be needed to properly identify those who may need to initiate and maintain insulin therapy among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as medically indicated </plain></SENT>
