<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>We addressed, whether pulsatile insulin secretion is related to glycaemic control, whether basal insulin supplementation increases postprandial insulin secretion, and if so, is this accomplished by a specific improvement in pulsatile insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 14 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent a mixed meal test before and after an 8-week treatment period with insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were measured, and insulin pulsatility was determined by deconvolution analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin treatment lowered fasting glycaemia from 179.6 ± 7.5 mg/dl to 117.6 ± 6.5 mg/dl (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprandial insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels increased significantly after the treatment period (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total calculated insulin secretion rate increased with insulin treatment (p = 0.0039), with non-significant increases in both pulsatile and non-pulsatile insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin pulse frequency was unchanged by the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relationship between fasting and postprandial glycaemia and insulin pulse mass (r(2) = 0.51 and r(2) = 0.56, respectively), whereas non-pulsatile insulin secretion was unrelated to either fasting or postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (r(2) = 0.0073 and r(2) = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperglycaemia</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with a reduction in postprandial insulin secretion, specifically through a reduction in insulin pulsatility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> by basal insulin therapy enhances endogenous beta-cell function in the postprandial state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data support the use of basal insulin regimens in the pharmacotherapy of overtly hyperglycaemic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
