<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nationally representative data (n=5073) from the 2007-2008 U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used for this investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio from multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> free NHW, NHB, and MA who are told of their increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk were more likely than those who are not told of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk to adopt healthy lifestyle behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Being told of increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was associated with increased adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors as indicated by odds ratio of 2.38 (95% CI=1.34-4.05) in NHW, 2.46 (95% CI=1.20-5.05) in NHB and 2.27 (95% CI=1.32-3.89) in MA who have no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, education, household income and total cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with implementing healthy lifestyle behaviors in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> free healthy American adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Population-based programs designed to assess and communicate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk may be helpful in preventing or delaying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Programs designed along racial/ethnic line may be needed to reduce racial/ethnic differences in rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
