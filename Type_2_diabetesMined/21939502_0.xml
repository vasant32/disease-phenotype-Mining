<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study centres in six European countries were randomised to either a benchmarking or control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physicians in both groups received feedback on modifiable outcome indicators (glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> [HbA1c], glycaemia, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>]-cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>) for each patient at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months, based on the four times yearly control visits recommended by international guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The benchmarking group also received comparative results on three critical quality indicators of vascular risk (HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and systolic blood pressure [SBP]), checked against the results of their colleagues from the same country, and versus pre-set targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 months of follow up, the percentage of patients achieving the pre-determined targets for the three critical quality indicators will be assessed in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recruitment was completed in December 2008 with 3994 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This paper discusses the study rationale and design of OPTIMISE, a randomised controlled study, that will help assess whether benchmarking is a useful clinical tool for improving outcomes in T2DM in primary care </plain></SENT>
