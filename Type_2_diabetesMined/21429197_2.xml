<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN22) has been established as a type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study found the C1858T variant of this gene to be associated with lower residual fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels and poorer glycemic control in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of the C1858T variant with residual beta-cell function (as assessed by stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, proinsulin and insulin dose-adjusted HbA1c), glycemic control, daily insulin requirements, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related autoantibodies (IA-2A, GADA, ICA, ZnT8Ab) in children during the first year after diagnosis of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The C1858T variant was genotyped in an international cohort of children (n = 257 patients) with newly diagnosed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 12 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of this variant with liquid-meal stimulated beta-cell function (proinsulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) and antibody status 1, 6 and 12 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition HbA1c and daily insulin requirements were determined 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> was defined at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A repeated measurement model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points showed the stimulated proinsulin level is significantly higher (22%, p = 0.03) for the T allele carriers the first year after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found a significant positive association between proinsulin and IA levels (est.: 1.12, p = 0.002), which did not influence the association between PTPN22 and proinsulin (est.: 1.28, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The T allele of the C1858T variant is positively associated with proinsulin levels during the first 12 months in newly diagnosed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> children </plain></SENT>
