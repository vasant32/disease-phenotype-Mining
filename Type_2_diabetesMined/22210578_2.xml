<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of early-phase insulin secretion on the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) participating in the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study (DPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined how a lifestyle intervention affected early-phase insulin secretion (ratio of total insulin area under the curve [AUC] and total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC [AIGR] from 0 to 30 min) during a 4-year follow-up intervention trial and whether AIGR(0-30) response was modified by insulin sensitivity (IS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 443 participants with IGT originally randomized to a lifestyle intervention or control group were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IS and AIGR(0-30) were estimated from an oral tolerance <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test administered annually during the 4-year follow-up trial and were related to the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> over a 6-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lifestyle intervention resulted in higher IS (P = 0.02) and lower unadjusted AIGR(0-30) (P = 0.08) during the 4-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher IS and a lower BMI during the follow-up were associated with a lower unadjusted AIGR(0-30) during the follow-up, independently of study group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A greater increase in IS on the median cutoff point of a 0.69 increase was associated with higher IS-adjusted AIGR(0-30) during the follow-up (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, IS and IS-adjusted AIGR(0-30) were both inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants who progressed to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had lower IS and Matsuda IS index-AIGR(0-30) than nonprogressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the reduction in the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after lifestyle intervention is related to the improvement of IS along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improved IS may also have beneficial effects on preservation of Î²-cell function </plain></SENT>
