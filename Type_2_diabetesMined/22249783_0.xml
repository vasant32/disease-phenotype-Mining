<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent evidence from case reports, observational studies, and randomized trials suggests that long-term use of antidepressants increases the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the nature of the relationship between antidepressants and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is an association between antidepressant use and the risk of developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nested case-control study using the Texas Medicaid prescription claims database was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted for new users of either antidepressant agents (exposed) or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> (unexposed) from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients aged 18-64 years without a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with antidepressant exposure was computed using conditional logistic regression, controlling for demographic and clinical covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the total sample (N = 44,715), the majority were in the exposed (N = 35,552) vs. the unexposed (N = 9,163) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,943 cases of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 11,748 matched controls (1:4) were identified using risk-set sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were matched using age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Antidepressant use was associated with an increase in the risk of (type-2) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when compared to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> use [Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.512; 95% CI 1.345-1.700] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association was observed with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (OR = 1.742; 95% CI 1.472-2.060), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> (OR = 1.533; 95% CI 1.295-1.814), selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (OR = 1.457; 95% CI 1.279-1.659), "Other" antidepressants (OR = 1.318; 95% CI 1.129-1.540) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant use was associated with an increased risk of (type-2) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This association was observed for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-reuptake inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors, and other antidepressants </plain></SENT>
