<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: TODAY (Treatment Options for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Adolescents and Youth) is a federally funded multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing three treatments of youth <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of youth participating in a 2-6 month run-in period in preparation for randomization into TODAY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: An ethnically diverse sample of 927 youth, 65.4% females, aged 13.7 ± 2.0 yr old, with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for a median of 2 months (0.7-7.8 months, 25th-75th percentiles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A run-in period was conducted to achieve HbA1c &lt;8% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education, and to evaluate adherence to pill taking, visit attendance, and other procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At entry, mean body mass index (BMI) and z-BMI were 35.6 ± 7.7 and 2.3 ± 0.4, respectively, mean HbA1c was 7.7 ± 2.2%, only 42.5% were on a hypoglycemic treatment, and 35.6% had HbA1c ≥8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comorbid conditions were common; 18.8% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 24.2% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated cholesterol</z:e>, and 6.5% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver enzymes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median 71 d of run-in, 90.9% had HbA1c &lt;8%, 77.9% had HbA1c &lt;7%, and 46.4% had HbA1c &lt;6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 772 youth achieving the target HbA1c &lt;8%, 704 (91.2%) were randomized; non-adherence to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment was the main cause for non-randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Youth proceeding to randomization <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased weight</z:hpo> by 0.68 kg and HbA1c by 1.45% compared to a <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> of 0.71 kg and HbA1c decrease of 0.74% in the non-randomized youth (p = 0.01 in both cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, change in z-BMI was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most youth with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can achieve target HbA1c &lt;8.0% with short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy and standard <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00081328) </plain></SENT>
