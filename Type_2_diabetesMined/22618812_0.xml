<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 605 patients aged 60 years or over with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the south west of the Netherlands participated in this cross-sectional study (response rate 48.7%), including 24 with a cardiologist-confirmed diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between February 2009 and March 2010, the patients without known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> underwent a standardised diagnostic work-up, including medical history, physical examination, ECG and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An expert panel used the criteria of the European Society of Cardiology to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 581 patients studied, 161 (27.7%; 95% CI 24.1%, 31.4%) were found to have previously unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>: 28 (4.8%; 95% CI 3.1%, 6.6%) with reduced ejection fraction, and 133 (22.9%; 95% CI 19.5%, 26.3%) with preserved ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> increased steeply with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> with preserved ejection fraction was more common in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular dysfunction was diagnosed in 150 patients (25.8%; 95% CI 22.3%, 29.4%); 146 (25.1%; 95% CI 21.6%, 28.7%) had diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This is the first epidemiological study that provides exact prevalence estimates of (previously unknown) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and left ventricular dysfunction in a representative sample of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previously unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and left ventricular dysfunction are highly prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physicians should pay special attention to 'unmasking' these patients </plain></SENT>
