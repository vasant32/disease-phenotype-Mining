<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six-week-old male Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and age-matched male Wistar rats (control group (Con)) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GK rats were randomly assigned to nonexercise (DB) and exercise (DBEx) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DBEx group was trained on a treadmill 5 times a week for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the capillary-to-fibre ratio or the capillary density were observed between the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> capillary diameter of the DB group was significantly lower than that of the Con group, whereas the capillary diameter of the DBEx group was significantly higher than that of the DB group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, SDH activity was significantly higher in the DBEx group than in the Con and DB groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Microangiopathy</z:e> of skeletal muscles in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was correlated with a decrease in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> capillary diameter, which was prevented by exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative capacity appears to be involved in the overall mechanism by which exercise prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
