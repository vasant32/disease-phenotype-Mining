<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) have a very high risk for major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that traditional oral diabetic medications, despite lowering blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, generally do not improve CV outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The safety of some oral hypoglycemic medications has been questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the CV safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, a novel class of oral diabetic medications, by performing a meta-analysis of DPP4 inhibitors for type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A search of electronic databases of published and unpublished literature (until September 30, 2011) was performed to identify randomized controlled trials of â‰¥24 weeks that compared DPP4 inhibitors to other oral diabetic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed using fixed and random effects to determine risk ratio (RR) for adverse CV events with DPP4 inhibitor monotherapy compared to other oral diabetic medications or to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen randomized met our inclusion criteria, comprising 4,998 patients who were randomized to DPP4 inhibitors and 3,546 to a comparator, with a median duration of therapy of 46.4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In pooled analysis, the RR of any adverse CV event with a DPP4 inhibitor was 0.48 (0.31 to 0.75, p = 0.001), and the RR for nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome was 0.40 (0.18 to 0.88, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that DPP4 inhibitors are safe from a CV standpoint and may possibly decrease risk of adverse CV events </plain></SENT>
