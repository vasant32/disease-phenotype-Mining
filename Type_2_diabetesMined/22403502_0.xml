<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 132 patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standard 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed, and the indices of insulin secretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher BMI was associated with higher homeostasis model assessment values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β), and insulinogenic index as well as lower levels of insulin sensitivity index composite (ISI(comp)) and disposition index (DI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression models, BMI had independent positive associations with HOMA-IR, ISI(comp), and HOMA-β and inverse associations with the DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that BMI had independent positive associations with indices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and an inverse association with β-cell function adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Korean patients newly presenting with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
