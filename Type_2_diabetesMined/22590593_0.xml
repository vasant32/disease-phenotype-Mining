<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 4739 subjects with T2DM and a prospective study of 297 subjects with T2DM in China respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were collected and biologic risk factors associated with any DR were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, we found that MA was an independent risk factor for DR development; further, when the patients were divided into MA deciles, odds ratio (ORs) of DR for the patients in the sixth MA decile (10.7 mg/24 h) was 1.579-fold (1.161-2.147) compared to that for patients in the first MA decile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the OR of DR increased with a gradual increase in MA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in the prospective study, during a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, we found that 51 patients (29.0%) of the 176 subjects with high MA level (10.7-30 mg/24 h) developed DR, while 17 patients (14.1%) of the 121 subjects with lower MA (&lt;10.7 mg/24 h) developed DR, and the relative risk ratio of the development of DR is 2.13(95% CI, 1.58-3.62, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that an MA threshold can predict the risk for the development of DR in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, although it is still within the traditionally established <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
