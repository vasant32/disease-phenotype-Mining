<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to compare <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and nonobese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients at baseline and after participating in an existing self-management intervention (i.e., Beyond Good Intentions) on cognitive, self-care, and behavioral measures to examine whether both groups are equally prepared and able to adopt self-management approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 94 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were included, of whom 64 (59% male) completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final sample consisted of 27 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (33% male) and 37 nonobese (78% male) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intervention comprised one individual and four group sessions and aimed to improve self-management behavior by enhancing proactive coping skills (i.e., setting concrete goals, identifying barriers, coping with difficult situations, action planning, and progress evaluation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognitive (i.e., proactive coping, self-control, self-efficacy), self-care (i.e., adherence to lifestyle recommendations), and behavioral (i.e., diet, exercise) measures were assessed at baseline and after completing the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients reported to possess lower cognitive skills and lower adherence to lifestyle recommendations compared with nonobese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intervention was effective in improving cognitive skills, self-care activities, as well as dietary and exercise behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvements were equal for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and nonobese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients were more likely to drop out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were found to possess limited skills at baseline compared with nonobese patients, the self-management course proved to be equally effective for both groups </plain></SENT>
