<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Our analysis included 4,366 Dutch participants who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up period of 12.4 years, 456 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intake of red meat, processed meat, and poultry was derived from a food frequency questionnaire, and their association with serum high-sensitivity CRP was examined cross-sectionally using linear regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their association with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, including age, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and lifestyle and dietary factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increment of 50 g of processed meat was associated with increased CRP concentration (Î²(processed meat) = 0.12; P = 0.01), whereas intake of red meat and poultry was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When comparing the highest to the lowest category of meat intake with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, the adjusted relative risks were as follows: for red meat (1.42 [95% CI 1.06-1.91]), for processed meat (1.87 [1.26-2.78]), and for poultry (0.95 [0.74-1.22]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis showed that the associations were not affected appreciably after inclusion of CRP into the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for BMI, however, the association for red meat attenuated to 1.18 (0.88-1.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intake of processed meat is associated with higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It appears unlikely that CRP mediates this association </plain></SENT>
