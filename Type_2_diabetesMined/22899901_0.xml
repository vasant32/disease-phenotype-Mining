<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that appropriate exercise improves early DN via attenuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic KK-A(y) mice, a spontaneous DN model, underwent two different kinds of exercise (i.e., moderate and low intensity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sedentary mice or those undergoing an exercise regimen causing no significant body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the urinary excretion of albumin, number of podocytes and macrophages, renal expressions of HIF-1α and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, and biomarkers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> such as urinary 8-OHdG and serum SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exercise reduced urinary levels of albumin and also maintained the number of podocytes in the exercised KK-A(y) mice independently of improvements of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, although moderate-intensity exercise increased expression of HIF-1α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sedentary KK-A(y) mice showed increased expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and infiltration of macrophage, increased urinary 8-OhdG, and decreased serum SOD levels compared with exercised KK-A(y) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the whole, low-intensity exercise attenuates progression of early DN without affecting marked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduction rates of urinary albumin and maintained podocyte numbers, with parallel improvements in oxidative damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, are related to beneficial effects of exercise in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
