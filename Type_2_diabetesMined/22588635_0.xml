<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dietary proteins influence postprandial <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>lipemia</z:mp> differently, and whey protein has a preferential <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of different whey protein fractions on postprandial <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and hormone responses added to a high-fat meal in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 12 type 2 diabetic subjects ingested four isocaloric test meals in randomized order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The test meals contained 100 g of butter and 45 g of carbohydrate in combination with 45 g of whey isolate (iso-meal), whey hydrolysate (hydro-meal), α-lactalbumin enhanced whey (lac-meal) or caseinoglycomacropeptide enhanced whey (CGMP-meal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15040">retinyl palmitate</z:chebi>, free fatty acid, insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glucagon, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were measured before and at regular intervals until 8-h postprandially.Results:We found no statistical significant differences between meals on our primary variable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15040">retinyl palmitate</z:chebi> response was higher after the hydro-meal than after the iso- and lac-meal in the chylomicron-rich fraction (P=0.008) while no significant differences were found in the chylomicron-poor fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hydro- and iso-meal produced a higher insulin response compared with the lac- and CGMP-meal (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Otherwise no significant differences in the hormone responses were found in the incremental area under the curve over the 480-min period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A supplement of four different whey protein fractions to a fat-rich meal had similar effects on postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> responses in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whey isolate and whey hydrolysate caused a higher insulin response </plain></SENT>
