<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control (C, n=10), diabetic (D, n=13) and diabetic treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (DT, n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was induced by high-fat and high-sugar diet and intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven rats in diabetic untreated group and twelve rats in diabetic treated group were successfully induced to be <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (3mg/kg/day) was administrated to diabetic treated rats by gavage for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve weeks later, the heart function was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma and myocardial adiponectin levels were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cardiac <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) was assayed by reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cardiac <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of p22phox and NOX4 was assayed by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cardiac protein expression of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="28659">phosphor</z:chebi>-AMPK-α (Thr172) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 4 (GLUT4) was determined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The protein expression of adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)were determined by immunohistochemistrial staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ratio of heart weight to body weight was significantly increased in diabetic rats compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Heart function, plasma and myocardial adiponectin levels, the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of myocardial adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, myocardial phosphorylation of AMPK-α (Thr172) and the protein expression of myocardial GLUT4 were significantly decreased in diabetic rats compared to control (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The expression of myocardial p22phox, Nox4, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and CTGF was significantly increased in diabetic rats compared to control (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment significantly attenuated the increased ratio of heart weight to body weight, and the increased expression of myocardial p22phox, Nox4, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and CTGF in diabetic rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Heart function, plasma and myocardial adiponectin levels, the expression of myocardial adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 and GLUT4, and myocardial phosphorylation of AMPK-α (Thr172) were significantly decreased in diabetic treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> compared to diabetic untreated (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on diabetic rat hearts may be attributable to the increased myocardial adiponectin and its receptors and the decreased myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
