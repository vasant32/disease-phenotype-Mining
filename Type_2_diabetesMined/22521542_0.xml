<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects of habitual physical activity and associated health risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined within the interrelations of intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and muscle density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two premenopausal women (mean age ± standard deviation: 38.6 ± 4.7 yr) underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and pQCT of foreleg and forearm scans to assess muscle and fat parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical activity status was based on 4-d self-reported log and pedometer step counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fat and muscle distribution between the foreleg and forearm were similar and highly correlated to total body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pQCT device reliably measured muscle density in the foreleg and forearm; coefficients of variation were 0.8% and 2.1%, which was therefore used to reflect IMAT status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscle density was positively related to physical activity and negatively associated with markers of fat distribution and risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pQCT is a novel, noninvasive tool to assess IMAT and muscle density in the foreleg and forearm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional research is necessary to understand the biology of IMAT and its relations with physical activity and potentially, with risks for cardiometabolic disease </plain></SENT>
