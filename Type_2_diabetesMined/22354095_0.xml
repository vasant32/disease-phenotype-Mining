<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Web of Science (up to August 31, 2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models in co-dominant, recessive and dominant models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding invalid studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six articles investigated the -429T/C polymorphism, 7 publications were associated with the -374T/A polymorphism and 5 studies were associated with Gly82Ser in DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the -429T/C variant, we found no significant difference between DR patients and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association of allele A with DR was found in the recessive model for the -374T/A variant (RE OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.42-0.99, p = 0.05, p <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the recessive and co-dominant models for the Gly82Ser polymorphism, the pooled ORs were positive in the fixed-effects model (FE OR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.49-5.60, p = 0.002, p <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.20; and FE OR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.76-6.67, p = 0.0003, p <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.07, respectively), but in the random-effects model the results were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our research confirmed an association between the RAGE -374T/A polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the -374AA allele was found to be a protective factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, the RAGE Gly82Ser polymorphism might be considered a significant risk for DR in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
