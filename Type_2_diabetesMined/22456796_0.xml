<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify a novel susceptibility locus for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we performed an imputation-based, genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Japanese population using newly obtained imputed-genotype data for 2 229 890 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) estimated from previously reported, directly genotyped GWAS data in the same samples (stage 1: 4470 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> versus 3071 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We directly genotyped 43 new SNPs with P-values of &lt;10(-4) in a part of stage-1 samples (2692 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> versus 3071 controls), and the associations of validated SNPs were evaluated in another 11 139 Japanese individuals (stage 2: 7605 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> versus 3534 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combined meta-analysis using directly genotyped data for stages 1 and 2 revealed that rs515071 in ANK1 and rs7656416 near MGC21675 were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population at the genome-wide significant level (P &lt; 5 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of rs515071 was also observed in European GWAS data (combined P for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations = 6.14 × 10(-10)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rs7656416 was in linkage disequilibrium to rs6815464, which had recently been identified as a top signal in a meta-analysis of East Asian GWAS for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r(2) = 0.76 in stage 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of rs7656416 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> disappeared after conditioning on rs6815464 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the ANK1 locus is a new, common susceptibility locus for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The signal of association was weaker in the directly genotyped data, so the improvement in signal indicates the importance of imputation in this particular case </plain></SENT>
