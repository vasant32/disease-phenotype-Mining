<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Main inclusion criteria were: pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on a stable dosage, HbA(1c) &lt; 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), age 30-65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive additional liraglutide or to remain on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 6 weeks (1.2 mg) and after 12 weeks (1.8 mg), venous blood was taken for the measurement of several laboratory markers characterizing vascular and endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular endothelial function and arterial stiffness were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) levels declined from 45 ± 4 mmol/mol (6.3 ± 0.4%; mean ± SD) to 40 ± 3 mmol/mol (5.8 ± 0.3%) during liraglutide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric dimethylarginin was reduced by liraglutide treatment from 0.39 ± 0.08 to 0.35 ± 0.06 μmol/l, E-selectin from 43.6 ± 15.4 to 40.8 ± 15.1 ng/ml, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 from 861.6 ± 584.3 to 666.1 ± 499.4 ng/ml and intact proinsulin from 9.0 ± 7.2 to 7.0 ± 4.8 pmol/l at 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The microvascular response to flicker light increased from 7.0 ± 15.1 to 15.4 ± 11.5% after 6 weeks and to 11.1 ± 9.9% after 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No change could be observed for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule or arterial stiffness parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, well controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, addition of liraglutide improves several cardiovascular risk markers beyond glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
