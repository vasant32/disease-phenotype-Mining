<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background:  Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 40 common sequence variants associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results are not always the same in populations with differing genetic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated a hypothesis that a North Asian population living in a geographic area with unusually harsh environmental conditions would develop unique genetic risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods:  A population-based association study was performed with 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine genes selected according to the results of GWAS conducted in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study participants included 393 full-heritage Mongolian individuals (177 diagnosed with T2D and 216 matched controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by TaqMan methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results:  The strongest association was detected with SNPs located within the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel-coding genes KCNQ1 (highest odds ratio [OR] = 1.92; P = 3.4 × 10(-5) ) and ABCC8 (OR = 1.79; P = 5 × 10(-4) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants identified as strongly influencing the risk of T2D in other populations (e.g. KCNJ11 or TCF7L2) did not show significant association in Mongolia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  The strongest T2D risk-associated SNPs in Mongolians are located within two of three tested <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel-coding genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accumulated variations in these genes may be related to the exposure to harsh environmental conditions </plain></SENT>
