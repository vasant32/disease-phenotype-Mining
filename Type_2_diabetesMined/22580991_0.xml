<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HbA(1c) level was measured in 812 serially registered normoalbuminuric adults aged 21-79 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After registration, a 1-year period to establish baseline values for mean HbA(1c) and HbA(1c) variability (measured as the intrapersonal SD of serially collected HbA(1c)) was decided upon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between HbA(1c) variability and the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was determined by Cox regression analysis after adjustment for other risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> occurred in 193 patients during the observation period of (mean ± SD) 4.3 ± 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even after adjustment for mean HbA(1c), HbA(1c) variability was a significant predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> independently of the mean HbA(1c); the HR for every 1% (95% CI) increase in mean HbA(1c) was 1.22 (1.06, 1.40) (p = 0.005), and that for HbA(1c) variability was 1.35 (1.05, 1.72) (p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of these two variables were quite similar when 1 SD was used; the HR for every 1 SD increase (95% CI) in HbA(1c) was 1.23 (1.07, 1.43) (p = 0.005), and that for HbA(1c) variability was 1.20 (1.03, 1.39) (p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: HbA(1c) variability affects the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> independently of mean HbA(1c) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be performed to evaluate the influence of HbA(1c) variability on other complications and in individuals of other ethnicities with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
