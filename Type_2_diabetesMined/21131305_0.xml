<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between drinking patterns, such as the weekly frequency of alcohol consumption and the quantity per drinking day, and the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been sufficiently addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study participants included 10 631 Japanese men aged 40-55 years without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed if a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was ≥7.0 mmol/l or if participants were taking <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on alcohol consumption were obtained from questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 37 172 person-years of follow-up, we confirmed 878 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequent alcohol consumption was associated with a low risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-drinkers, the multiple-adjusted HR for those who drank 4-7 days weekly was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To assess the association between drinking pattern and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we examined the joint association of the weekly frequency and the quantity per drinking day with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Men who consumed 0.1-2.0 or 2.1-4.0 US standard drinks per drinking day on 4-7 days weekly had a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.91, respectively) compared to non-drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: More frequent alcohol consumption lowered the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Light to moderate alcohol consumption per drinking day on 4-7 days weekly lowered the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to non-drinkers </plain></SENT>
