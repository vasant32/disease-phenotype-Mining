<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to establish whether a pragmatic structured education programme targeting lifestyle and behaviour change in conjunction with motivational maintenance via the telephone can reduce the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in people with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and/or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) identified through a validated risk score screening programme in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial undertaken at the level of primary care practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up will be conducted at 12, 24 and 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes include changes in HbA1c, Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, cardiovascular risk, the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Syndrome</z:e> and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consists of screening and intervention phases within 44 general practices coordinated from a single academic research centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those at high risk of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are identified using a risk score and invited for screening using a 75g-Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> Tolerance Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with screen detected impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation will be invited to take part in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Practices will be randomised to standard care or the intensive arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants from intensive arm practices will receive a structured education programme with motivational maintenance via the telephone and annual refresher sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study will run from 2009-2014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study will provide new evidence surrounding the long-term effectiveness of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programme conducted within routine primary care in the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
