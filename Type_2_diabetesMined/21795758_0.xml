<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of sleep quality with glycaemic control and its impact on type 2 diabetic patients in an Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 46 subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA1C was measured in each patient, and each patient completed the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Good sleep quality was defined as PSQI score â‰¤5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender and body mass index, the total PSQI score and sleep efficiency (P &lt; 0.05) were significantly correlated with the level of HbA1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of sleep efficiency for HbA1C level was 6.83 [OR = 6.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.04-22.8, P = 0.002] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjusted ORs of worse glycaemic control for the poor sleep quality group was 6.94 with regard to the group of good sleep quality (OR = 6.94, 95% CI: 1.02-47.16, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that both poor sleep quality and less-efficient sleep are significantly correlated with worse glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings are expected to contribute to the prevention and risk reduction of microvascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
