<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Metabolic alterations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> are interrelated processes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) that often develop in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association of vasoactive precursor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (VPPs) with MetS and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma levels of pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) and proadrenomedullin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proADM) were measured by novel sensitive assays in 1590 participants of the population-based KORA F4 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of the VPPs with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, MetS defined by IDF criteria, the components of MetS, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) was assessed in logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated levels of CT-proET1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proADM were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, MetS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) in age-sex adjusted models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, former vascular complications, lifestyle factors, hsCRP and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> significant associations with MetS were found for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proADM (OR=5.94 95%-CI 3.78-9.33) and CT-proET-1 (OR=5.18, 95%-CI 3.48-7.71) (top quartile versus bottom quartile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proADM and CT-proET-1 were strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> components of MetS as defined by IDF criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proADM and CT-proET-1 with pathological <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> disappeared and a borderline association with IR was found only for CT-proET1 (OR=1.34, 95%-CI: 0.96-1.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We here demonstrate for the first time that plasma levels of CT-proET-1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proADM are both related to MetS and its components, thus suggesting that they possibly have a role as surrogate biomarker for the disease and its complications </plain></SENT>
