<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated associations of the five genetic polymorphisms in the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the generalised multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method to identify gene-gene interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The D allele in the ACE gene was significantly more frequent in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the DD genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CAD (p = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1675G/A variant in the AT2R gene was found to be associated with CAD in female subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three other polymorphisms of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> do not seem to influence the development of CAD in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant gene-gene interaction for any combinations of genotypes was found in the GMDR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The DD variant of the ACE gene polymorphism is associated with increased risk of developing CAD in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A slight impact of AT2R 1675G/A polymorphism on CAD was found only in female diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
