<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aims  We investigated the influence of different aspects of alcohol consumption on the risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods  We used data from the Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>øndelag Health Survey (HUNT) study, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adults aged ≥ 20 years from Nord-Trondelag County were invited to participate in three surveys in 1984-1986, 1995-1997 and 2006-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified using self-reports, and participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age ≥ 35 years were classified as having Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> if they were negative for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (n = 1841) and as having autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> if they were positive for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (n = 140) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios of amount and frequency of alcohol use, alcoholic beverage choice, and binge drinking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001956" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcohol use disorders</z:e> were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results  Moderate alcohol consumption (adjusted for confounders) was associated with a reduced risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men, but not in women (hazard ratio for men 10-15 g/day 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.77; hazard ratio for women ≥ 10 g/day 0.81, 95% CI 0.33-1.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduced risk was primarily linked to consumption of wine [hazard ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.99 (per g/day)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No increased risk was seen in participants reporting binge drinking or in problem drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were also compatible with a reduced risk of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with alcohol consumption [hazard ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.45-1.08 (frequent consumption) and hazard ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.97 (2-7 g/day)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions  Moderate alcohol consumption associates with reduced risk of both Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A protective effect of alcohol intake may be limited to men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High alcohol consumption does not seem to carry an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>. © 2012 The Authors </plain></SENT>
