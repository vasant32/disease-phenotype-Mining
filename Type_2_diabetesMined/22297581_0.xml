<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We cross-sectionally investigated the prevalence and prospectively the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> and postdiabetic presence of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e>-associated protein 2 and zinc transporter 8 in LADA and in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 208 'classic' type 1, 161 LADA and 302 type 2 diabetic cases from the second (HUNT2: 1995–1997) and third (HUNT3: 2006–2008) Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>øndelag health surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospective data were available for 59 type 1, 44 LADA and 302 type 2 diabetic cases followed from HUNT2 to HUNT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From HUNT3, 24 type 1 diabetic and 31 LADA incident cases were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, 90% of LADA cases were positive for only one antibody (10% multiple-antibodypositive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospectively, 59% of GADA-positive LADA patients in HUNT2 were no longer positive in HUNT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LADA patients who became negative possessed less frequently risk HLA haplotypes and were phenotypically more akin to those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than to those who stayed positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Still, those losing positivity differed from those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by lower C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of incident LADA cases in HUNT3, 64% were already antibody-positive in HUNT2, i.e. before <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These incident LADA cases were phenotypically more akin to type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than were those who did not display positivity in HUNT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The pattern of antibodies, the postdiabetic loss or persistence as well as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> absence or presence of antibodies influence LADA phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent presence or absence of antibodies adds new modalities to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of LADA </plain></SENT>
