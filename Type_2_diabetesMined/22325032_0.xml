<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> MILES (Management and Impact for Long-term Empowerment and Success) Study is an international collaborative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> MILES--Australia, the first <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> MILES initiative to be undertaken, was a national survey of adults living with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to gather data that will provide insights into how Australians manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the support they receive and the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on their lives, as well as to use the data to validate new <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The survey was designed to include a core set of self-report measures, as well as modules specific to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type or management regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other measures or items were included in only half of the surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognitive debriefing interviews with 20 participants ensured the survey content was relevant and easily understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In July 2011, the survey was posted to 15,000 adults (aged 18-70 years) with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> selected randomly from the National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Services Scheme (NDSS) database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An online version of the survey was advertised nationally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,338 eligible Australians took part; most (70.4%) completed the postal survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Respondents of both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types and genders, and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, were adequately represented in both the postal and online survey sub-samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> took part in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> MILES--Australia (58.8% versus 41.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most respondents spoke English as their main language, were married/in a de facto relationship, had at least a high school education, were occupied in paid work, had an annual household income &gt; $AUS40,000, and lived in metropolitan areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: A potential limitation of the study is the under-representation of respondents from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> MILES--Australia represents a major achievement in the study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Australia, where for the first time, the focus is on psychosocial and behavioural aspects of this condition at a national level </plain></SENT>
