<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 DM (T2DM), specific predictors for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e> (NDRD) are needed in addition to the traditional indicators for renal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1 January 2000 to 31 March 2011, we retrospectively enrolled 54 T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> who had undergone renal biopsies into the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations between NDRD and 20 potential biomarkers, including serum levels of Igs and proteins associated with kidney function, and urinary protein and red blood cell levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> virus carrier status, were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression showed that reduced serum IgG (odds ratio [OR] 0.997; P = 0.006; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-0.998) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (Cr; OR 0.587; P = 0.014; 95% CI 0.348-0.897) were predictors of NDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC(ROC) ) confirmed the good discriminatory power of IgG (AUC(ROC) 0.857 ± 0.058; 95% CI 0.744-0.970; P &lt; 0.001) and Cr (AUC(ROC) 0.838 ± 0.054; 95% CI 0.732-0.943; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IgG level below which the risk for NDRD increased, as calculated by obtaining the best Youden index, was 919.5 mg/dL (sensitivity 91.7%; specificity 83.3%), and the corresponding Cr level was 4.1 mg/dL (sensitivity 58.3%; specificity 96.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum IgG levels &lt;919.5 mg/dL and serum Cr levels &lt;4.1 mg/dL are associated with NDRD in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
