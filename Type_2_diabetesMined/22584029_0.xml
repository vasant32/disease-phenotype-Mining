<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Osteopontin (OPN) has been suggested to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal diseases</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005576'>tubulointerstitial fibrosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, information on association of genetic polymorphisms in OPN with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study was designed with the aim to examine the association of an OPN gene promoter polymorphism with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in Asian Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OPN C-443T (rs11730582) polymorphism was determined in 1115 type 2 diabetic patients belonging to two independently ascertained cohorts using Real time PCR based Taqman assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a nearly threefold elevated risk of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> among carriers of T allele and TT genotype of OPN C-443T polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, this allele was found to be significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and lower eGFR, a hallmark of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, in both our cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first study which suggests that OPN C-443T polymorphism may be a significant risk factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
