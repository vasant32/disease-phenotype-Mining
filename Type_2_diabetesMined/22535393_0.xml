<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was done with PCR, followed by melting curve analysis with specific fluorescent hybridization probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that distributions for TT, Tt and tt genotypes were 51, 46 and 3% in the patient group, and 35, 49 and 16% in the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the T allele in patients was also significantly higher than that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the results, the relationship between the VDR gene TaqI polymorphism and T2DM patients in the Turkish population was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of the VDR gene TaqI polymorphism, there was no statistically significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) between the T2DM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Application of RT-qPCR method enabled us to assess the prevalence of the VDR gene TaqI polymorphism and its association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
