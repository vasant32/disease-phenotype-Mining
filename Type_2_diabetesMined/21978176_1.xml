<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To estimate population values of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in subjects with and without Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> across several large population-based survey studies in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systematic differences in relation to age and sex were of particular interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individual data from four population-based studies from different regions throughout Germany and the nationwide German National Health Interview and Examination Survey (GNHIES98) were included in a pooled analysis of primary data (N = 9579) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRQL was assessed using the generic index instrument SF-36 (36-item Short Form Health Survey) or its shorter version, the SF-12 (12 items) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis was carried out to examine the association between Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the two component scores derived from the SF-36/SF-12, the physical component summary score (PCS-12) and the mental component summary score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>-12), as well as interaction effects with age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PCS-12 differed significantly by -4.1 points in subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in comparison with subjects without Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with significantly lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>-12 in women only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher age was associated with lower PCS-12, but with an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>-12, for subjects with and without Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analysis of population-based primary data offers HRQL values for subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Germany, stratified by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has negative consequences for HRQL, particularly for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This underlines the burden of disease and the importance of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factors that disadvantage women with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> need to be researched more thoroughly </plain></SENT>
