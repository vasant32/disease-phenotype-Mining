<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported low adherence with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies comparing discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> compared with discontinuation of oral anti-diabetics within the same individuals before and after initiation of oral anti-diabetic drugs are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe discontinuation among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> prior to and after initiation of oral anti-diabetics and to compare <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> discontinuation with discontinuation of oral anti-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report an observational cohort study among patients initiating treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> prior to or after initiation of oral anti-diabetics between 1999 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> prior to initiation (Prior users) or after initiation (After users) of anti-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation was defined as an interval of 180 days or more between the theoretical end date of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>/anti-diabetic prescription and the dispensing date of the next <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>/anti-diabetic prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We included 3323 starters with oral anti-diabetic drugs in our study; 2072 patients initiated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in the period of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation rates for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were higher compared with oral anti-diabetics (52.1 vs 15.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After users discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy more frequently compared to prior users (62.8 vs 48.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> is higher compared with anti-diabetic discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> after the initiation of oral anti-diabetic treatment are more likely to discontinue treatment than patients who initiate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> before the start of oral anti-diabetics </plain></SENT>
