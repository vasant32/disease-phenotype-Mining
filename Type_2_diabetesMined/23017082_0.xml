<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) seems to play an important role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>; however, some aspects of this issue are still scarcely known, such as the expression of AGEs in type 1 DM-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> and the clinical factors able to affect their accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to clarify these points by evaluating the expression of AGEs in DM-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen systemically and periodontally healthy subjects and 48 subjects suffering from generalized, severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> (16 with type 1 DM, 16 with type 2 DM and 16 systemically healthy subjects) were studied clinically, periodontally and metabolically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical expression of AGEs in gingival tissues was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects affected with type 1 DM presented a significantly higher percentage of AGE-positive cells than did subjects affected with type 2 DM, not only in the epithelium, but also in vessels and fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive and significant correlation was found between gingival expression of AGEs and length of time affected with DM both in type 1 and type 2 DM; glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, body mass index and age did not correlate significantly with gingival AGEs in any of the classes of subjects studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gingival AGEs are increased in both type 1 and type 2 DM-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>; however, the clinical parameter that determines their accumulation, and therefore their degree of influence on the development of DM-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>, may be the duration of DM </plain></SENT>
