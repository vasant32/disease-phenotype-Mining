<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of habitual sleep quantity and quality with the self-reported pattern of eating behavior in 53 healthy urban adults with parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (30 F/23 M; mean (s.d.) age: 27 (4) years; BMI: 23.9 (2.3) kg/m(2)) while taking into consideration the amount of their everyday physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants completed 13 (3) days of sleep and physical activity monitoring by wrist actigraphy and waist accelerometry while following their usual lifestyle at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overnight laboratory polysomnography was used to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjective sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eating behavior was assessed using the original 51-item and the revised 18-item version of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire including measures of cognitive restraint, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo>, hunger, and uncontrolled and emotional eating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age, BMI, gender, race/ethnicity, level of education, habitual sleep time measured by wrist actigraphy and physical activity measured by waist accelerometry, lower subjective sleep quality was associated with increased hunger, more disinhibited, uncontrolled and emotional eating, and higher cognitive restraint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between the amount of sleep measured by wrist actigraphy and any of these eating behavior factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that small decrements in self-reported sleep quality can be a sensitive indicator for the presence of potentially problematic eating patterns in healthy urban adults with familial risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
