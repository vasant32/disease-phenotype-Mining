<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using data for 960 adult patients admitted between May 2005 and April 2008 with a primary or secondary diagnosis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University Medical School (SRRSH) in Hangzhou, China, we evaluate the association between patient characteristics and inpatient costs with multivariable regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total inpatient costs were positively associated with age, higher UKPDS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk score, and presence of any complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A regression that included patient socioeconomic and clinical characteristics explained 21.5% of the variation in total inpatient costs; regression estimates indicate that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> had inpatient costs that were respectively 93.7%, 14.0%, 17.5%, 11.5% and 89.0% higher than otherwise similar patients without those complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmaceutical costs did not differ by insurance coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insured patients spent 7-16% more on laboratory tests than otherwise similar patients did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical factors, especially presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications, appear to be the primary determinants of variation in inpatient costs for patients with type 2 DM in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To mitigate the health costs increases associated with China's DM epidemic, policymakers should focus on cost-effective ways to manage patients in outpatient settings to prevent the complications associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
