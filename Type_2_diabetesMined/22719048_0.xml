<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the efficacy of VSG to prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been previously investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VSG or sham surgery was performed on 2-month-old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> male University of California Davis-type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated animals were either sham-operated ad libitum fed (S-AL) or were weight-matched to VSG-operated animals (S-WM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was determined by weekly nonfasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals underwent oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests at 1 and 4 months after surgery and indirect calorimetry at 1.5 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VSG surgery significantly delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> compared with both S-AL and S-WM animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VSG-operated animals ate 23% less and weighed 20% less than S-AL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Energy expenditure did not differ between VSG-operated animals and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results from the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests demonstrate <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> and islet function in VSG-operated animals compared with S-AL and S-WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nutrient-stimulated glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1, GLP-2, and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY excursions were greater in VSG-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VSG surgery resulted in decreased fasting plasma insulin, ghrelin and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations, and markedly higher fasting plasma adiponectin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations, independent of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increases of circulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations were due to selective increases of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>-conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, VSG delays type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the University of California Davis-type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> rat, independent of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is potentially mediated by increases of circulating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, adiponectin, and nutrient-stimulated GLP-1 secretion and decreased circulating ghrelin concentrations </plain></SENT>
