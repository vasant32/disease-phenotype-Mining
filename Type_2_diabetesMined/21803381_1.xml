<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This cohort study investigated the association between dietary glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and the incidence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in middle-aged Japanese men, and the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and pancreatic B-cell function on the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were 1995 male employees of a metal products factory in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary GI and GL were assessed using a self-administered diet history questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was detected in annual medical examinations over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between GI, GL, and the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the study, 133 participants developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age- and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios across the GI quintiles were 1.00 (reference), 1.62, 1.50, 1.68, and 1.80; and those of GL were 1.00 (reference), 1.07, 1.48, 0.95, and 0.98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for the highest GI quintile was significantly greater than that for the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The influence of GI was more pronounced in the lowest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GI and pancreatic B-cell function were independently associated with the incidence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>; participants with low B-cell function and the highest tertile of GI had the highest risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dietary GI is associated with the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged Japanese men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GI and B-cell function were independently associated with incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
