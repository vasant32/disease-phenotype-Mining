<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), defined as having low ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI), have increased risk for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with those without PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to reveal whether ABI abnormality, especially high ABI is associated with prevalent silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (SCI) in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 538 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, 227 women and 311 men, with a mean [±SD] age of 64±11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values of ABI were classified as low (&lt;0.9), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (0.9≤ and &lt;1.3), and high (1.3≤) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for prevalent SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ABI among the overall 538 patients was 1.09±0.16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low and high ABI values were found in 52 (9.7%) and 33 (6.1%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SCI was detected in 297 (55.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence in patients with low, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and high ABI values were 88.5%, 49.7%, and 78.8 (p&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, both patients with high and low ABI were significantly increased risk of prevalent SCI (odds ratio 4.53, 95% CI 1.67-12.34, p=0.003 and odds ratio 3.50, 95% CI 1.50-10.29, p=0.005), independently of other traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both high and low ABI may be strongly associated with prevalent SCI in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
