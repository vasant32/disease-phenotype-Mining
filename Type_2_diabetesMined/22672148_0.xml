<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 46) attending two community pharmacies in Hertfordshire, UK were randomized to one of two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in the intervention group (n = 23) received a programme of education about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, its treatment and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were seen for monitoring/counselling by a community pharmacist on six occasions over a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measures included HbA(1c), BMI, blood pressure, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the control group (n = 23) underwent these measurements at baseline and at 12 months only, without specific counselling or education over and above usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) fell from 66 mmol/mol (8.2%) to 49 mmol/mol (6.6%) (P &lt; 0.001) in intervention group, compared with reduction from 65 mmol/mol (8.1%) to 59 mmol/mol (7.5%) in the control group (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure fell from 146/87 to 126/81 mmHg in the intervention group (P = 0.01) compared with no significant change in the control group (136/86 to 139/82 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in BMI (30.8 to 27 kg/m(2), P &lt; 0.001) and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (8.8 to 6.9 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001) were also observed in the intervention group as compared with no significant changes in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> profile changes were mixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the intervention group, improvements were seen in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quality of life (P = 0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge (P = 0.018), belief about the need for medication (P = 0.004) and reduced concerns regarding medication (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Education and counselling by community pharmacists can result in favourable improvements to the cardiovascular risk profile of patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
