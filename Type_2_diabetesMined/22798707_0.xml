<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to a placebo group or a rice bran oil group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The placebo group consumed 250 mL soybean oil-modified milk (18 g soybean oil) daily for 5 weeks, and the rice bran oil group consumed 250 mL rice bran oil modified milk (18 g rice bran oil) daily for 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At week 0 and week 5, anthropometric measurements, hematology tests, and an oral-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerance test were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the homeostasis model assessment index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the area under the curve for postprandial serum insulin, and serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations increased significantly in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the rice bran oil group, fasting and 2-h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and the area under the curve for postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased significantly; however, total serum cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the homeostasis model assessment index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consumption of 18 g rice bran oil modified milk daily for 5 weeks significantly decreased total serum cholesterol concentrations and tended to decrease <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant influence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
