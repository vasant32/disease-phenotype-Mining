<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We induced HS or sham procedure in type 2 diabetic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Creatininemia, glomerular filtration rate, urine output, histologic injury score, and kidney inductible molecule 1 mRNA were used to investigate the renal impact of HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissular <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and its impact were quantified using pimonidazole immunostaining and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of hypoxic inducible factor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2, Tie-2, endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic mice exhibiting mild diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> express hypoxic signals at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The renal impact of HS was more severe in diabetic mice, with a worsening of tissular <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and an altered response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase was highly overexpressed in diabetic shocked mice when compared with nondiabetic shocked mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Renal impact of HS in type 2 diabetic mice is more intense than in nondiabetic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preexisting <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> during <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could result in a renal preconditioning that modifies endothelial and tissular responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
