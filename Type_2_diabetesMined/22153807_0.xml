<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between the baseline serum level of soluble CD 26/DPP-4 and the response to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, a DPP-4 inhibitor, over 24 weeks in patients who had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 52 consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had poor glycemic control despite treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were given 50 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and were followed at monthly intervals for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> decreased significantly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) from 7.91 ± 1.08% at baseline to 6.96 ± 1.18% at 8 weeks, 7.04 ± 0.77% at 16 weeks, and 7.08 ± 0.80% at 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baseline serum level of sCD26 was correlated positively with HbA1c at both 16 weeks and 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the serum sCD26 level at baseline was also correlated positively with the changes from baseline of HbA1c at 16 and 24 weeks (r = 0.318, P = 0.0296 and r = 0.516, P = 0.0003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression model that explained 56.1% (R(2) = 0.561) of the variation of the changes from baseline of HbA1c at 24 weeks, the baseline HbA1c (β = -0.638, P &lt; 0.001) and serum sCD26 (β = 0.357, P = 0.041) were independent determinants of the change of HbA1c at 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusions, a higher serum level of sCD26 is associated with a worse response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> controlled inadequately by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
