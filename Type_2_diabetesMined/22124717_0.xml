<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether combined lifestyle behaviors have an impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients aged 30-94 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants included 5,686 patients &gt;30 years old with T2DM who were enrolled in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care Management Program at a medical center in central Taiwan before 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle behaviors consisted of smoking, alcohol drinking, physical inactivity, and carbohydrate intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cause-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between combined lifestyle behaviors and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mortality rate among men was 24.10 per 1,000 person-years, and that among women was 17.25 per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for the traditional risk factors, we found that combined lifestyle behavior was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and mortality due to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with three or more points were at a 3.50-fold greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (95% CI 2.06-5.96) and a 4.94-fold (1.62-15.06), 4.24-fold (1.20-14.95), and 1.31-fold (0.39-4.41) greater risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>-specific, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific mortality, respectively, compared with patients with zero points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these associations, the combined lifestyle behavior was not significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined lifestyle behavior is a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
