<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Method and Materials: Sixteen patients diagnosed with generalized severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were allocated to the diabetic group; another 15 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> but without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> were placed in the nondiabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both groups were treated using the FMUD protocol, a unique 45-minute session of ultrasonic debridement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites presenting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were analyzed for the following parameters: plaque and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> indices, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017572" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gingival recession</z:e>, probing depth, and clinical attachment level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, diabetic subjects were assessed using fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated at 3 and 6 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ANOVA and the Tukey test were used for data analysis (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: Both groups showed improved periodontal health after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the parameters assessed (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects treated with FMUD had a clinical response similar to that of nondiabetic subjects at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pocket depths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects or medical disturbances were observed in either group during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FPG and HbA1c levels remained unaltered after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, FMUD promoted clinical improvements in patients with type 2 uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and generalized severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
