<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 1,139 type 2 diabetic patients who initiated insulin therapy between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of interest were the proportion of patients achieving A1C &lt;7% and mean change in A1C within 3-9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean A1C at insulin initiation was 8.2 vs. 9.2% among those who did and did not attain A1C &lt;7% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within a mean of 5 months, 464 (40.7%) patients attained A1C &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses controlling for insulin regimen, dose, and oral agent use, preinsulin A1C was responsible for nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the explained variance in A1C change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each one percentage point of preinsulin A1C reduced the probability of attaining &lt;7% by 26% (odds ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.68-0.80]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin initiation at lower levels of A1C improves goal attainment and independently increases glycemic response </plain></SENT>
