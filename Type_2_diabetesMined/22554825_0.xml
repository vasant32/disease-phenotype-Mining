<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: : To check for the association of genetic polymorphisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genes with the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> among type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : Participants comprised 202 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, of whom 102 were affected with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants corresponding to MTHFR C677T, A1298C and ACE I/D genotypes were determined using the PCR technique coupled with digestion and restriction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Cases with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> had a significantly higher frequency of the MTHFR 677 TT, 677 CT, ACE DD mutant genotypes compared with diabetic cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the association of studied MTHFR C677T, A1298C and ACE I/D polymorphisms with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> showed that the MTHFR 677 T polymorphism, in the recessive and dominant models, was a risk factor for both micro and macroalbuminuria, while the ACE DD mutant genotype was a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and the MTHFR 1298C in the dominant model only was a risk factor for macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: : These findings indicate that ACE and MTHFR genetic polymorphisms might be considered as genetic risk factors for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
