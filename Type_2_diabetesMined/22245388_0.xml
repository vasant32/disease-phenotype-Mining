<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence supports an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context, anti-diabetic agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 have been reported to reduce pathologies associated with AD, including tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that such agents might be used to treat AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One such anti-diabetic agent is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, which acts through inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV to increase GLP-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given this action, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> would be predicted to reduce AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> is effective in attenuating AD pathologies, focusing on tau phosphorylation in the OLETF type 2 diabetic rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was not effective against pathological tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus of OLETF type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> rats, and instead aggravated it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This paradoxically increased tau phosphorylation was attributed to activation of the tau kinase, GSK3β (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3β) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> also increased ser-616 phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, suggesting increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These phenomena were recapitulated in primary rat cortical neurons treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, further confirming <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>'s effects on AD-related pathologies in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the need for caution in considering the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> in AD therapy </plain></SENT>
