<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is increasing worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to understand the influence of H. pylori eradication therapy on the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methodology: A total of 174 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who did not have an active <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> or serious complications and were cured successfully of their H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at our institute were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time course of mean glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) values and body mass index (BMI) during the year before and after H. pylori eradication were assessed by a paired Student's t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: No significant changes in mean HbA1c values were observed during the year before or after eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the mean BMI, which did not change during the year before eradication, increased significantly at 6 months (23.1±2.6kg/m2, p&lt;0.05) and 12 months (23.1±2.7kg/m2, p&lt;0.05) after eradication as compared with the time point of eradication (22.9±2.6kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: H. pylori eradication significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> but not HbA1c in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, despite <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
