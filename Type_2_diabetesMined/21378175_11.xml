<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk scores (GRSs) developed from these loci predict <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested if a GRS based on an updated list of 34 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated loci predicted progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or regression toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (NGR) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 34 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated variants in 2,843 DPP participants at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from five ethnic groups representative of the U.S. population, who had been randomized to placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We built a GRS by weighting each risk allele by its reported effect size on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and summing these values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested its ability to predict <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence or regression to NGR in models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, waist circumference, and treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate-adjusted models, the GRS was significantly associated with increased risk of progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02 per risk allele [95% CI 1.00-1.05]; P = 0.03) and a lower probability of regression to NGR (HR = 0.95 per risk allele [95% CI 0.93-0.98]; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, a higher GRS was associated with a lower insulinogenic index (P &lt; 0.001), confirming an impairment in Î²-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We detected no significant interaction between GRS and treatment, but the lifestyle intervention was effective in the highest quartile of GRS (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high GRS is associated with increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and lower probability of returning to NGR in high-risk individuals, but a lifestyle intervention attenuates this risk </plain></SENT>
