<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in diabetic patients monitored at an outpatient endocrinology clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To ascertain treatment used and its changes over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 424 randomly selected diabetic patients (both type 1 and type 2) was monitored from 2004 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Final cohort size was 343 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected about epidemiological characteristics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications, glycemic, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and blood pressure control, and treatment at baseline and 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 4 years, the proportion of patients achieving glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels less than 7% remained stable (type 1: 18.5% in 2004 vs 21.7% in 2008, type 2: 26.6% vs 26.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of achievement of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and blood pressure (BP) control levels increased in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The complexity of treatment schemes used to achieve these results significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization of glycemic control after 4 years of follow-up was a positive result, considering the long course of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, progressive pancreatic function impairment, and complexity of our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment optimization significantly improved BP and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control in the study group </plain></SENT>
