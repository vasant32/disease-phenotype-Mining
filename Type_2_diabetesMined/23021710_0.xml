<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Limited evidence suggests habitual dairy consumption to be protective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetSyn) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association of baseline consumption of dairy products with the incidence of MetSyn and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among a cohort of Australian adults aged 49 years and over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A validated 145-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess food and nutrient intake at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten-year incidence of MetSyn and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were obtained from 1807 and 1824 subjects respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by discrete time logistic regression modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with subjects in the lowest intake quartile of regular fat dairy products, those in the highest quartile had a 59% lower risk of MetSyn (multivariate adjusted OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.23-0.71; p(trend) = 0.004), after adjustment for risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, an association between a high intake of regular fat dairy foods and reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also found (age and sex adjusted OR 0.37; 95% CI: 0.16-0.88; p(trend) = 0.030), but the association did not persist after adjustment for additional confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between total dairy consumption and risk of MetSyn or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found an inverse association between regular fat dairy consumption and risk of MetSyn among Australian older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to examine the association between weight status, dairy consumption and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
