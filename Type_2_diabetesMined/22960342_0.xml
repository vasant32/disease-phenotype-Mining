<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects and methods: A total of 212 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and 101 type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of urinary chiro- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> were measured by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: The concentration of urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23098">chiro-inositol</z:chebi> was significantly higher in the diabetic subjects (2.24 ± 5.18 ng/L) than those in the control group (0.38 ± 0.62 ng/L; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> level of the diabetic subjects (36.95 ± 37.77 ng/L) was also significantly higher than that of the controls (8.17 ± 13.29 ng/L; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23098">chiro-inositol</z:chebi> multiplied by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> level of the diabetic subjects (148.10 ± 544.91) was significantly higher than in the controls (5.12 ± 24.15; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23098">chiro-inositol</z:chebi> multiplied by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> level to predict T2DM was 0.840 (confidence interval 0.789-0.891, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cut-off value for the urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23098">chiro-inositol</z:chebi> multiplied by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> level to predict T2DM was 2.20 (sensitivity 81.3%, specificity 70.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The urinary chiro- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> concentrations were increased in the type 2 diabetic patients and the urinary chiro- times the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> was considered to be a sufficient marker in predicting T2DM </plain></SENT>
