<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study in outpatient clinics at Shands Jacksonville Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were assigned into either the pharmacist group or the nonpharmacist group, according to the presence or the absence of a pharmacist in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the absolute change in A1C versus baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included change in cholesterol and blood pressure and the number of patients to attain American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>End points were recorded to correlate within 3 months of the initial visit and final visit with a provider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to the nonpharmacist group, patients in the pharmacist group had more advanced and uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pharmacist group showed a greater percent change in A1C and improvement between the initial and final clinic visits, after adjusting for baseline confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the statistically significant improvement in A1C in the pharmacist group, there was no difference found between the 2 groups for the end points of cholesterol and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Including a pharmacist as a part of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management team may result in lower A1C in patients with more advanced and uncontrolled type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> versus a health care team without a pharmacist </plain></SENT>
