<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients consumed isocaloric fat- or carbohydrate-rich diet for 3 weeks in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After each dietary intervention period, muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, triacylglycerol and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content and plasma concentrations of insulin, adiponectin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and FFA were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was assessed by HOMA2 calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the dietary period, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin, insulin sensitivity, muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, triacylglycerol and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin concentration was significantly higher after fat compared with carbohydrate-rich diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that following fat-rich diet intake muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> and triacylglycerol concentrations were not different compared with that after carbohydrate-rich diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, plasma adiponectin concentration was higher after fat-rich compared with carbohydrate-rich diet, but insulin sensitivity remained similar despite the major difference in dietary macronutrient composition </plain></SENT>
