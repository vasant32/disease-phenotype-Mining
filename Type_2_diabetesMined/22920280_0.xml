<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: We developed and validated an automated database case definition for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children and youth to facilitate pharmacoepidemiologic investigations of medications and the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study was part of an in-progress retrospective cohort study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Tennessee Medicaid enrollees aged 6--24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was identified from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related medical care encounters: hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and filled prescriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The definition required either a primary inpatient diagnosis or at least two other encounters of different types, most commonly an outpatient diagnosis with a prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined by insulin prescriptions with at most one oral hypoglycemic prescription; other cases were considered type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The definition was validated for cohort members in the 15 county region geographically proximate to the investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed and adjudicated for cases that met the automated database definition as well as for a sample of persons with other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related medical care encounters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 64 cases that met the automated database definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Records were adjudicated for 46 (71.9%), of which 41 (89.1%) met clinical criteria for newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 80.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For type 2 and unspecified <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> combined, the positive predictive value was 83.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated sensitivity of the definition, based on adjudication for a sample of 30 cases not meeting the automated database definition, was 64.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the automated database case definition for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be useful for pharmacoepidemiologic studies of medications and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
