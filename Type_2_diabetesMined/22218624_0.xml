<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">Proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) as adjunctive therapy might improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control through increasing serum gastrin and fasting insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electronic medical records in a family medicine residency program office practice were reviewed for 73 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (not taking insulin), for whom <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> were prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Values for glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) for periods of time when a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> had been prescribed were compared with HbA1c levels for periods of time with no record of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> prescribing or over-the-counter <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean HbA1c for patients not taking insulin was 7.11 during periods with recorded prescribing or over-the-counter use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, compared with 7.70 during periods without recorded <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy was not significantly different (6.81 with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> vs. 7.10 without <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>; n = 16; P = .25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c was significantly different for combination therapy that included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and/or giltazone (7.26 vs. 7.80; n = 27; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed association between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy and lower HbA1c levels suggests that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> may be useful as adjunctive therapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
