<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The outcome and the therapy of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN), and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e> (NDRD) are quite different, so the differential diagnosis is of considerable importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the usefulness of renal biopsy in type 2 diabetic patients, we examined the relationship between the clinical parameters and the histopathological findings in different age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Renal biopsy specimens and clinical and laboratory data from 216 patients with type 2 DM were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to their age, three groups were defined: 17-35 years (group I), 36-59 years (group II), and more than 60 years (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study showed that, beside the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, other clinical parameters were not significantly different between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268732" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nephritic syndrome</z:e> was the most common clinical manifestation in group I (44.1 %) and in group II (34.0 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients in group III, we found a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> (34.3 %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> (28.6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the clinical manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000794'>IgA nephropathy</z:hpo> was the most common pathologic finding in group I (29.4 %) and in group II (34.7 %), whereas the most frequent abnormalities in group III were membranous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (25.7 %) and tubulointerstitial lesions (14.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, among these patients, 14 cases were diagnosed with DN (6.5 %), 179 with NDRD (82.9 %), while 23 had concurrent DN and NDRD (10.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the clinical manifestations and pathologic findings in type 2 diabetic patients in different age groups have different features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study emphasized the usefulness of renal biopsy for determining the pattern of renal damage and thus for the overall management of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
