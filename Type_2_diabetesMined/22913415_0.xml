<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between fruit intake and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in these patients is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between dietary fruit intake and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods:  A total of 255 Chinese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary fruit intake was assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and carotid intima-media thickness was measured by high-resolution ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results:  Among patients with three different tertiles of fruit intake (14.5 ± 8.6 vs. 41.5 ± 7.1 vs. 92.6 ± 39.7 g/day), there was no difference in their clinical characteristics (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with the highest tertile of fruit intake had a significantly higher BMI and diastolic blood pressure than those with the lowest tertile intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase were similar among the three tertiles of patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with the highest tertile of fruit intake had lower carotid intima-media thickness (0.97 ± 0.02 vs. 1.08 ± 0.03 mm, P = 0.046) and prevalence of carotid plaque (11.76 vs. 1.18%, P = 0.022) than those with the lowest tertile of fruit intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis revealed the highest tertile of fruit intake (β = -0.086, P = 0.049) was independently associated with carotid intima-media thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  Our results demonstrated that, in Chinese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, higher dietary fruit intake was associated with a lower burden of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as reflected by lower carotid intima-media thickness and prevalence of carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
