<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many Japanese subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are less <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> despite compared with Caucasian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between SDB and clinical characteristics other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, especially in relation to cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (CAN) in Japanese subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included a total of 261 consecutive Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including nonobese subjects defined as BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2) for Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SDB was screened by 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) level of 5 or more events per hour, which was measured by nocturnal pulse oximetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAN was examined with the variation of R-R intervals (CVRR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SDB were found in 24.5% of total subjects and 16.3% of nonobese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nonobese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subjects with SDB had significantly lower coefficient of CVRR than those without SDB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis revealed that BMI and heart rate were significant independent factors for SDB in total subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but CVRR was the only significant independent factor for SDB in nonobese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the presence of SDB should be kept in mind in type 2 diabetic patients with abnormality in CVRR variation in electrocardiogram even though they are not <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
