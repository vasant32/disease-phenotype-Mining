<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Osteocalcin (OC), an osteoblast-specific protein, has been demonstrated to affect <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in both animals and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in animals have shown an effect of undercarboxylated OC (ucOC) on beta-cell proliferation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether OC is associated with the future development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans, as well as the relative importance of ucOC vs OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine serum OC and its post-translational forms as potential biomarkers for future the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a nested case-control study using data from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 63 men without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the exploratory cohort at baseline who developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM) during the 10-year follow-up period from 1998-2008, and also 63 men age- and BMI-matched for a non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control group (non-DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum N-mid OC and ucOC were measured in baseline blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to explore and identify baseline factors, including OC and ucOC, that predicted the subsequent development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age and BMI were similar in both non-DM and DM groups (47·2 ± 0·5 vs 47·8 ± 0·8 years and 25·2 ± 0·5 vs 25·9 ± 0·5 kg/m(2) , respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only baseline mean serum N-mid OC (15·2 ± 0·5 vs 13·0 ± 0·5 μg/l, P &lt; 0·05) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (4·92 ± 0·04 vs 5·28 ± 0·07 mmol/l, P &lt; 0·05) were significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that baseline serum N-mid OC and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but not ucOC, were independent risk factors for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this long-term study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circulating total OC is associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies to evaluate the potential utility of OC as a biomarker to predict the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are warranted </plain></SENT>
