<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess if plasma markers associated with NAFLD are increased in people with concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 68 participants were recruited from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and liver clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>Fatty liver</z:hpo> disease was indicated by routine blood tests and ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven participants had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; of them, 18 had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease as defined previously (DNoFLD) and 29 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (DFLD); the remaining 21 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease but no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (NonDFLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were analyzed for adiponectin (APN), alanine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferases and plasma for cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> (HA), procollagen <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> III, alkaline phosphatase and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">Hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> and procollagen <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> III were significantly higher and adiponectin significantly lower in DFLD than NonDFLD and DNoFLD, the difference being particularly marked for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> and APN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in these markers between NonDFLD and DNoFLD and no association between any plasma or serum marker and ultrasound grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have identified markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> that appear to be specific for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A further longitudinal study is merited to assess the role of these markers in understanding the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in people with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
