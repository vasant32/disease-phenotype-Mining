<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study attempts a first step in seeking solutions to decrease demand for health services in this population by improving patients' self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focus groups were conducted in well-controlled (HbA1c &lt; 7) and poorly-controlled (HbA1c &gt; 8) Chinese Americans with Type 2 DM who were asked about their knowledge and self-care skills of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as experience of living with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Well-controlled had more insights in their illness and were more inquisitive, while poorly-controlled were more fixated on symptoms and side effects of treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Common themes for both groups included interest in diet and Traditional Chinese Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings provide valuable information to design a survey instrument to more definitively assess self-care skills differentiating levels of control, suggest that changing attitudes and behaviors need to be a stronger focus in care and identify needs to provide more culturally appropriate materials to care for this population </plain></SENT>
