<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of 925 individuals at high risk for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FINDRISC-score â‰¥ 13) in 14 general practices in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intervention consisted of lifestyle counselling from the nurse practitioner and the general practitioner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Usual care consisted of oral and written information at the start of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study groups were compared over 2.5 years regarding changes in clinical and lifestyle measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups showed modest changes in body weight, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, physical activity and dietary intake [weight: intervention group, -0.8 (5.1) kg, usual care group, -0.4 (4.7) kg, (P=0.69); fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>: intervention group, -0.17 (0.4) mmol/l, usual care group, -0.10 (0.5) mmol/l, (P=0.10)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences between groups were significant only for total physical activity and fibre intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the intervention group, self-efficacy was significantly higher in individuals successful at losing weight compared with unsuccessful individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in participant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were found between general practitioners and nurse practitioners with different levels of motivation or self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> risk factors could significantly be reduced by lifestyle counselling in Dutch primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, intervention effects above the effects attributable to usual care were modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Higher participant self-efficacy seemed to facilitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000745'>Lack of motivation</z:hpo> or self-efficacy of professionals did not negatively influence participant guidance </plain></SENT>
