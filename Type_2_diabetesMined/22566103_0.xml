<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from two Swedish registries of type 2 diabetic patients (n = 12,515) undergoing coronary angiography between the years 2001 and 2009 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment and long-term mortality was studied after extensive adjustment for cardiovascular- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into four groups, according to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment: diet alone; oral therapy alone; insulin in combination with oral therapy; and insulin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean follow-up time of 4.14 years, absolute mortality rates for patients treated with diet alone, oral therapy alone, insulin in combination with oral therapy and insulin alone were 19.2%, 17.4%, 22.9% and 28.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with diet alone, insulin in combination with oral therapy (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.12, 1.43) and insulin alone (HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.44, 1.83) were associated with higher mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for baseline differences, insulin in combination with oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment (HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.06, 1.40; p &lt; 0.005) and treatment with insulin only (HR 1.17; 95% CI 1.02, 1.35; p &lt; 0.01) remained independent predictors for long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with insulin and undergoing coronary angiography have a higher long-term mortality risk after adjustment for measured confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to evaluate the optimal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment for these high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
