<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of this effect are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether peripheral insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp is increased in patients presenting for hyperbaric oxygen therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals without Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=5) or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were given 100% oxygen at 2.0 absolute atmospheres for 2 h, six sessions per week for 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peripheral insulin sensitivity was increased in the whole cohort (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis revealed that this was significant at both treatment 3 (+37.3 ± 12.7%, P=0.02) and treatment 30 (+40.6 ± 12.6%, P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was significantly reduced in subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Insulin sensitivity increased within 3 days of hyperbaric oxygen treatment and this was maintained for 30 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increase in insulin sensitivity is equivalent to that observed following moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the insulin-sensitizing effect of hyperbaric oxygen require further elucidation </plain></SENT>
