<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated relationships between that of overall mortality and dietary pattern, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and dietary pattern as observed among 912 registered cases of the J-EDIT study, which is a prospective follow-up study of elderly Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Factor analysis with the factor number 3 led to deriving three dietary patterns (healthy type, snack type and greasy type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between these patterns and overall mortality or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, there was a lower tendency of overall mortality and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> for the healthy type dietary pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the tendencies of overall mortality were analyzed for "young-old," who are younger than 75 years-of age, and "old-old" of over 75 years-of-age, the mortality rate for the greasy type and healthy type dietary patterns were nearly the same and higher than the snack type dietary pattern in young-old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in old-old, a higher mortality rate was reported for the greasy type dietary pattern and a lower mortality rate was reported for the healthy type dietary pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio by Cox regression analysis for greasy type to healthy type in old-old was 3.03 (P = 0.04, CI 1.07-8.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in old-old, as vegetable consumption increased, the lower the tendency foroverall mortality, and the more fish that was consumed, the overall mortality significantly decreased (P = 0.020) in the tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The greasy type dietary pattern with an increased amount of sugar, fat and meat led to poor life prognosis for elderly Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The healthy type dietary pattern rich in vegetable and fish, which is similar to the Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approach to Stop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> diet, was suggested to improve life prognosis </plain></SENT>
