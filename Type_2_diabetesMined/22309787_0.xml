<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: B mode ultrasonographic scanning of the carotid artery and multislice computed tomography (MSCT) coronary angiography were performed in 227 diabetic patients without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PS was useful to predict the presence of diseased [nonobstructive and obstructive] CAD (≧3 segments) and obstructive (≧50%) CAD with cut-off value of 3.5mm (area under curve: 0.745 and 0.782, respectively), according to a receiver operating characteristics curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic analysis of baseline risk factors showed that the PS was independent risk factor for the prediction of diseased and obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (R(2)=0.2165, p&lt;0.0001 and R(2)=0.2265, p&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PS was most significant predictor of the number of diseased and obstructive segments of the coronary artery in a multiple regression analysis (R(2)=0.2022, p&lt;0.0001 and R(2)=0.2209, p&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PS in the carotid artery was useful for the prediction of the presence and the extent of CAD, and was most important as a screening test for the identification of a high risk group of asymptomatic diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
