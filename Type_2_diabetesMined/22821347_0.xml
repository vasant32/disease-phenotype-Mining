<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether attenuation is related to decreased release of a mediating humoral cardioprotective factor or reduced ability to respond in the target tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the release and effect of a circulating cardioprotective factor in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn from nine non-diabetic subjects, eight diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, and eight diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> before (control) and after a remote ischemic preconditioning (rIPC) stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were dialyzed against Krebs-Henseleit buffer and the cardioprotective effects of the dialysates were tested in rabbit hearts mounted on a Langendorff model and subjected to 30-min global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 120-min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rIPC dialysate from non-diabetic and diabetic subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved hemodynamic recovery compared to control dialysate from non-diabetic and diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in the subgroup of diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> the cardioprotective effect was attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the release mechanism involves neural pathways </plain></SENT>
