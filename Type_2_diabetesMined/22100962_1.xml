<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may experience high burden of treatment (BOT), including treatment-related effects and self-care demands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their clinicians discuss BOT, the characteristics of their discussions, and their attempts to address BOT during visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two coders independently reviewed videos of 46 primary care visits obtained during a practice-based trial and identified utterances concerning BOT, classifying them by topic and by whether BOT was addressed (i.e., whether statements emerged aimed at alleviating BOT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 46 visits, 43 (93.5%) contained BOT discussions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both coders identified 83 discussions: 12 involving monitoring, 28 treatment administration, 19 access, and 24 treatment effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BOT was unambiguously addressed only 30% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BOT discussions usually arise during visits but rarely beget problem-solving efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These discussions represent missed opportunities for reducing treatment-related disruptions in the lives of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which may affect adherence and well-being </plain></SENT>
