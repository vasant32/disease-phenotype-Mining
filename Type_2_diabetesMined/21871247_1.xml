<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared clinical characteristics, symptoms, and gastric emptying in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetic (DG) or idiopathic (IG) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from 416 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> who were enrolled in the National Institute of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and Digestive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kidney Diseases</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>Gastroparesis</z:hpo> Registry; 254 had IG (most were female and white), and 137 had DG (78 had type 1 and 59 had type 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Registry data included detailed histories, physical examinations, results from gastric emptying scintigraphy, and responses to validated symptom questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) were an average of 13 years older at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo> and heavier than patients with IG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 1 DM had more hospitalizations in the past year than patients with IG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms that prompted evaluation more often included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> for DG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> for IG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with DG had more severe retching and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> than those with IG, whereas patients with IG had more severe early satiety and postprandial fullness subscores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with IG, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585136" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric retention</z:e> was greater in patients with type 1 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than 50% of patients with type 1 DM had severe retention (&gt;35% at 4 hours); they took prokinetic agents more frequently and were more likely to receive gastric electric stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are similarities and differences in clinical characteristics of DG and IG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>Gastroparesis</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder; its etiology affects symptoms and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term studies are needed to determine whether the differences in symptoms and gastric emptying affect progression and treatment responses </plain></SENT>
