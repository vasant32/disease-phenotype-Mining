<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They can cause deviation of genotypes from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic case-control association studies in Thais revealed that genotype distribution of CAPN10 Indel19 was deviated from HWE after correction of genotyping error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aim to identify CNVs within CAPN10 Indel19 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The semi-quantitative denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) method was used to detect CNVs in the region of CAPN10 Indel19 marker in cohort of 305 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 250 control subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CNVs in the region of CAPN10 Indel19 was successfully detected by DHPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After correction of genotype calling based on the status of identified CNVs, CAPN10 Indel19 genotypes were well-fitted for HWE (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find association between CNV genotypes and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CNVs in CAPN10 have been identified in Thais </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These CNVs lead to deviation from HWE of CAPN10 Indel19 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After excluding identified CNVs from the analysis, CAPN10 Indel19 was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The information obtained from our study would be helpful for genotyping accuracies of SNPs residing in the CNVs region </plain></SENT>
