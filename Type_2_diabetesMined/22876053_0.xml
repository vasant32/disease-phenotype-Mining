<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed costs for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and associated complications in 3,125 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were obtained from the Korean National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Program (KNDP), a large, ongoing, prospective cohort study that began in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cost data were prospectively collected, using an electronic database, for the KNDP cohort at six hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The costs were analyzed according to complications for 1 yr from enrollment in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 3,125 patients, 918 patients had no vascular complications; 1,883 had microvascular complications only; 51 had macrovascular complications only; and 273 had both complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual direct medical costs for a patient with only macrovascular, only microvascular, or both macrovascular and microvascular complications were 2.7, 1.5, and 2.0 times higher than the medical costs of patients without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Annual direct medical costs per patient increased with the number of microvascular complications in patients without macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The economic costs for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are attributable largely to the management of microvascular and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proper management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and prevention of related complications are important for reducing medical costs </plain></SENT>
