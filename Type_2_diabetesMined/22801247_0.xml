<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown if treatment with exogenous insulin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who are most prone to hepatic fat accumulation, would promote the occurrence or worsening of nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with treatment-naive type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (N = 16) were treated with insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for a 3-month lead-in period, then assigned triple oral therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) or continued treatment with insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content (HTC)-measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, liver function tests, and inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers were followed for a median of 31 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 45% decline in HTC during the lead-in period persisted through the follow-up period with no difference between treatment groups at the end of the study (5.26 ± 4.21% in the triple oral therapy vs 7.47 ± 7.40% for insulin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>), whereas glycemic control was comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in HTC with initial insulin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy persisted through the median 31-month follow-up period regardless of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, insulin-based treatment did not appear to promote or worsen nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
