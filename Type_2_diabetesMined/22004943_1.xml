<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared real life costs in 19,888 propensity score matched pairs of T2DM DMP participants and T2DM patients in routine care (RC) according to sickness funds data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We estimated mean annual costs for survivors, last year of life costs for decedents, the influence of ageing on costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and effects on hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Annual costs for survivors were 3,318€ (DMP) and 3,570€ (RC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean costs in the last year of life were 16,911€ (DMP) and 15,763€ (RC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ageing had a cost triggering effect for survivors (30€/36€ per year in DMP-/RC-group; p&lt;0.001) and a cost decreasing effect in the last year of life (546€/483€ per year in DMP-/RC-group; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the DMP vs. RC was -1396€ per life-year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hospitalizations increased with age in case of survival and decreased with age in case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> but were always lower in the DMP-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite increase in costs due to longer life DMPs are cost-effective </plain></SENT>
