<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To establish the association among FHT2DM, risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in subjects from central Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Clinical and biochemical studies were performed in 383 first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 270 subjects unrelated to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were from the city of Puebla in central Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regressions were used to assess the association between FHT2DM and metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular risk was classified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FHT2DM was associated with risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, such as increased fasting insulin levels (OR = 1.731, 95% CI = 1.041-2.877), decreased insulin sensitivity (OR = 1.951, 95% CI = 1.236-3.080) and pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.14-2.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FHT2DH was not associated with risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.70-1.79) and FRS (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.40-1.36) when adjusted for gender, age, smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diabetic risk factors, but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors, are associated with a positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects from central Mexico, independent of the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
