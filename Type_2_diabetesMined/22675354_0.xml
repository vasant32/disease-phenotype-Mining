<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that women who experience <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> are at a greater risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within 10-20 years of their index pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If considered as a stand-alone indicator of the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> is a poor diagnostic test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most women do not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> during pregnancy and of those that do most do not develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a clear need for better early detection of predisposition to disease and/or disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to significantly impact on this global pandemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The putative benefits of multivariate approaches and first trimester and preconception screening to increase the sensitivity of risk assignment modalities for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are proposed </plain></SENT>
