<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data about 20 717 subjects aged 45-59 years from the cross-sectional 2002 China National Nutrition and Health Survey were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High fat-low carbohydrate diet was scored according to the energy of carbohydrate, fat, and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 20 717 subjects, 1 332 were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and 662 were newly diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate adjusted analysis showed that the highest score of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients was 2.75 (95% CI: 2.09-3.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The score of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients was 1.87 (95% CI: 1.35-2.58) after further adjustment for their socioeconomic status and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in the odds ratio after further adjustment for BMI, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level, and energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No evidence was observed for the relation between high fat-low carbohydrate-diet score in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients due to high family income, less education, physical activity, overweight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, high TG, or low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High fat-low carbohydrate diets, far different from traditional Chinese diets, are associated with the high incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
