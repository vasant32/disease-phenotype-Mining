<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct comparisons with active <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering comparators in drug-naive patients have demonstrated that DPP-4 inhibitors exert slightly less pronounced HbA(1c) reduction than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (with the advantage of better gastrointestinal tolerability) and similar <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects as with a thiazolidinedione (TZD; with the advantage of no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients, gliptins were associated with similar HbA(1c) reductions compared with a sulphonylurea (SU; with the advantage of no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, considerably fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> and no need for titration) and a TZD (with the advantage of no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and better overall tolerability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors also exert clinically relevant <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects compared with a placebo in patients treated with SU or TZD (of potential interest when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is either not tolerated or contraindicated), and as oral triple therapy with a good tolerability profile when added to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-SU or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-SU combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several clinical trials also showed a consistent reduction in HbA(1c) when DPP-4 inhibitors were added to basal insulin therapy, with no increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the complex pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the complementary actions of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents, initial combination of a DPP-4 inhibitor with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or a glitazone may be applied in drug-naive patients, resulting in greater efficacy and similar safety compared with either drug as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, DPP-4 inhibitors were less effective than GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> for reducing HbA(1c) and body weight, but offer the advantage of being easier to use (oral instead of injected administration) and lower in cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one head-to-head trial demonstrated the non-inferiority of saxagliptin vs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clearly, more trials of direct comparisons between different incretin-based therapies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of their pharmacokinetic characteristics, pharmacodynamic properties (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect) and good overall tolerability profile, DPP-4 inhibitors may have a key role to play in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> and in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of DPP-4 inhibitors in the therapeutic armamentarium of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is rapidly evolving as their potential strengths and weaknesses become better defined mainly through controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
