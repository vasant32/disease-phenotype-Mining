<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association between urinary BPA concentration and the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study included Korean adult participants (n=1210) aged 40-69 years and was based on the 2009 Korean National Human Biomonitoring Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics and medical history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were collected from the participants by questionnaire, and BPA levels were determined by analysis of urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the participants was 53.4 years and 41.6% were men; the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> differed according to demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The geometric mean urinary BPA levels of participants with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 2.03 and 2.40ng/mL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among BPA quartiles, no clear association was found between BPA levels and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the adjusted odds ratio of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was slightly increased for participants in the upper BPA quartile, the association was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a high body BPA burden may not be associated with an increased prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Korean adults </plain></SENT>
