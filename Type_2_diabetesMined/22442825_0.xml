<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To build a mechanism-based population pharmacodynamic model to describe and predict the time course of active GLP-1, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin in type 2 diabetic patients after treatment with various doses of vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vildagliptin concentrations, DPP-4 activity, active GLP-1, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations from 13 type 2 diabetic patients after oral vildagliptin doses of 10, 25 or 100 mg and placebo twice daily for 28 days were co-modelled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The population PK/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> model was developed utilizing the MC-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> algorithm in parallelized S-ADAPT version 1.56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> model, active GLP-1 production was stimulated by gastrointestinal intake of nutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Active GLP-1 was primarily metabolized by DPP-4 and an additional non-saturable pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulated secretion of insulin which stimulated utilization of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Active GLP-1 stimulated both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion and insulin-dependent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete inhibition of DPP-4 resulted in an approximately 2.5-fold increase of active GLP-1 half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effects of vildagliptin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> endpoints were successfully described by the proposed model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of vildagliptin on glycaemic control could be evaluated from a variety of aspects such as effects of DPP-4 on GLP-1, effects of GLP-1 on insulin secretion and effects on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present model can be used to predict the effects of other dosage regimens of vildagliptin on DPP-4 inhibition, active GLP-1, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations, or can be modified and applied to other incretin-related anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapies </plain></SENT>
