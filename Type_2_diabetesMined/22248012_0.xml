<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objective:  Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has anti-angiogenic, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the significant role it plays in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, PEDF is now used in the treatment of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It possibly plays a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> cases, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment has any significant effects on PEDF levels is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the regulation of PEDF in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in relation to fat mass and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> before and after the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Design:  Prospective cohort study Subjects:  Thirty six patients with newly-diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 33 healthy individuals Measurements:  Baseline weight, waist circumference (WC), fasting (FPG) and postprandial (PPPG) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, HbA1c, HOMA, PEDF, total/truncal fat mass were determined both in the diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedures were repeated in the diabetic group after a 6-month <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results:  Baseline FPG, PPPG, HbA1c, HOMA, weight, WC and truncal fat mass were higher in diabetic patients whereas PEDF levels were found to be comparable with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We completed the study with 31 of the 36 diabetic patients we had selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed a decrease in the weight, WC, FPG, PPPG, HOMA, total and truncal fat mass of the patients while there was a significant rise in the PEDF levels (p=0.002) after the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, no significant correlation was observed between the change in PEDF levels, and the clinical and laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  Our study is the first to identify a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> related increase in PEDF levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The increase observed in PEDF levels after the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment does not seem to be related to the changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, fat mass or glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence, our results suggest that further investigation is necessary to determine the direct effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on PEDF gene and protein expression in vitro. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </plain></SENT>
