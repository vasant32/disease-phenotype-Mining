<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous GLP-1 infusion improves endothelial function in vivo; no evidence about a beneficial effect of exenatide on vascular function has been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our observational study was to evaluate whether exenatide would improve brachial artery function evaluated by the flow mediated dilation (FMD) technique, compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FMD time course was assessed by ultrasound, after 5 min forearm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, at baseline and after 16-week treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study FMD was significantly higher in subjects who assumed exenatide compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (9.1 ± 3.6 vs. 5.6 ± 1.0, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even if limited by the small number of studied subjects, who were not matched in the two treatment groups, this research study represents the first FMD evidence suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of exenatide improves arterial dilation </plain></SENT>
