<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared A1C, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) or 2-h post-challenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2-hPG) criteria for the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a cohort of Italian Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1019 individuals without known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and had A1C measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moderate agreement existed for A1C and FPG criteria for diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (κ coefficient = 0.522), with 85.5% of individuals classified as not having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by both A1C and FPG criteria, and 5.8% classified as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by both A1C and FPG criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discordant classifications occurred for 5.5% of individuals who had an A1C ≥ 6.5% and FPG &lt;126 mg dl(-1), and for 3.2% who had an A1C &lt;6.5% and FPG ≥126 mg dl(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modest agreement existed for A1C and 2-hPG criteria for diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (κ coefficient = 0.427), with 81.8% of individuals classified as not having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by both A1C and 2-hPG criteria, and 6.0% classified as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by both A1C and 2-hPG criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of A1C for identifying subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to FPG or 2-hPG criteria was 0.856 and 0.794, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modest agreement existed for A1C and FPG and/or 2-hPG criteria for diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (κ coefficient = 0.446) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A1C ≥ 6.5% demonstrates a moderate agreement with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 2-hPG for diagnosing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among adult Italian Caucasians subjects </plain></SENT>
