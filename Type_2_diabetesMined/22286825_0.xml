<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a workplace leisure physical activity program on healthcare expenditures for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed a workplace program's potential to reduce costs by multiplying the annual healthcare costs of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> by the population attributable risk fraction of non-recommended physical activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Feasibility of a physical activity program was assessed among 425 employees of a public university in Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: If 400 sedentary employees engaged in a physical activity program to decrease their risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the potential annual healthcare cost reduction would be 138 880 US dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each dollar invested in physical activity could reduce treatment costs of both diseases by 5.3 dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This research meets the call to use health economics methods to re-appraise health priorities, and devise strategies for optimal allocation of financial resources in the health sector </plain></SENT>
