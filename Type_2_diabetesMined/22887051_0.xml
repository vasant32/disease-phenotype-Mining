<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted an open label study to examine the clinical effects of supplementation of the reduced form of CoQ10, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17976">ubiquinol</z:chebi>, in addition to conventional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine subjects (3 males and 6 females) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and receiving conventional medication were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were assigned to receive an oral dose of 200 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17976">ubiquinol</z:chebi> daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17976">ubiquinol</z:chebi> on blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, glycemic control, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were examined before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17976">ubiquinol</z:chebi> supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, five healthy volunteers were also assigned to receive an oral dose of 200 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17976">ubiquinol</z:chebi> daily for 4 weeks to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17976">ubiquinol</z:chebi> on insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there were no differences with respect to blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> marker, and inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there were significant improvements in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (53.0 ± 4.3 to 50.5 ± 3.7 mmol/mol, P = 0.01) (7.1 ± 0.4 to 6.8 ± 0.4%, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In healthy volunteers, the insulinogenic index (0.65 ± 0.29 to 1.23 ± 0.56, P = 0.02) and the ratio of proinsulin to insulin were significantly improved (3.4 ± 1.8 to 2.1 ± 0.6, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of our study are consistent with the suggestion that the supplementation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17976">ubiquinol</z:chebi> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in addition to conventional antihyperglycemic medications, improves glycemic control by improving insulin secretion without any adverse effects.© 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc </plain></SENT>
