<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred ten patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to receive sweet foods containing either 50 g/day isomaltulose or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> for 12 weeks as part of their habitual diet under free-living conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) at 12 weeks was the primary outcome parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the final analysis comprising 101 patients, isomaltulose did not significantly affect HbA(1c) at 12 weeks (<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>: 7.39 ± 0.78%; isomaltulose: 7.24 ± 0.76%; regression coefficient [b]: 0.02 [95% CI: -0.21 to 0.25], P = 0.844) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">Triglycerides</z:chebi> at 12 weeks were significantly lower in the isomaltulose versus the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> group (b: 34.01 [6.59-61.44], P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other secondary parameters did not significantly differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isomaltulose did not influence glycemic control assessed as HbA(1c) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under free-living conditions but was associated with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
