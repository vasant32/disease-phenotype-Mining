<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 420 patients (49% men) receiving <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care at the Douala General and Yaound√© Central hospitals were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic abnormalities were investigated, identified and related to potential determinants, with logistic regressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age and median duration of diagnosis were 56.7 years and four years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main electrocardiographic aberrations (prevalence %) were: T-wave abnormalities (20.9%), Cornell product <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (16.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (16.2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> (13.6%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e> (11.9%), QTc prolongation (10.2%) and ectopic beats (4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure variables were consistently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> electrocardiographic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-specific factors were associated with some abnormalities only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic aberrations in this population were dominated by repolarisation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, and were more related to blood pressure than <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific factors </plain></SENT>
