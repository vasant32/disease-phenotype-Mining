<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The perception of a need to change is considered essential in behaviour change processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the existing literature on individuals' perceived need to change health behaviour is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to improve understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention through increased physical activity levels (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e>), we assessed factors associated with perceiving a need to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> among adults at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Opportunistic screening was used within a primary-care based lifestyle intervention covering 10 149 men and women at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained at baseline visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The explored determinants were demographic, anthropometric/clinical, behavioural and psychosocial characteristics, along with four categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 74% of men (n=2 577) and 76% of women (n=4 551) perceived a need to increase their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The participants most likely to perceive this need were inactive, had a larger waist circumference, rated their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> as insufficient, and were at the contemplation stage of change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Smoking, elevated blood pressure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, and a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were not associated with this perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The likelihood was also greater among women with less perceived fitness and less education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Demographic factors other than education did not determine participants' perceived need to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> overestimators were less likely to perceive the need to increase their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> than realistic inactive participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjective rather than objective health factors appear to determine the perception of a need to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> among adults at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Client perceptions need to be evaluated in health counselling in order to facilitate a change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Practical descriptions of the associations between metabolic risk factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are needed in order to make the risk factors concrete for at-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
