<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: To examine the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and miglitol when added to ongoing insulin treatment in a patient with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had undergone partial gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) was performed and either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or miglitol, or both, were added to fixed-dose insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood was drawn at 0, 30, 60, and 120Â min after breakfast, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GIP) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CGM showed that compared to insulin alone, the addition of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or miglitol, or both, to insulin achieved better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to insulin alone, early postprandial increments in plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels and suppressed glucagon levels were observed when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glucagon suppression was even more prominent when both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and miglitol were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to insulin alone, GLP-1 levels were higher during the early postprandial stage when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or miglitol was added and even higher when both were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GIP levels decreased when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or miglitol, or both, were added to insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors showed that the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or miglitol, or both, was effective in this insulin-treated patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had undergone gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
