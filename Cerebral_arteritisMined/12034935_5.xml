<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging findings of radiation-induced cranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> regarding arterial wall thickening and degree of enhancement, as well as to compare the findings with those of idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in five patients with radiation-induced large cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had undergone irradiation 2-25 years prior to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional nonenhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic, and contrast material-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Special attention was paid to wall enhancement of the affected arteries (distal internal carotid artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wall enhancement was staged in three levels by two neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751322" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary moyamoya disease</z:e> for comparison and analyzed them statistically (Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Wall thickening and prominent ring enhancement of the wall of the affected large cerebral arteries were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (five of five) patients with radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, wall thickening and prominent ring enhancement of the wall of the occluded arteries either were not seen (13 of 18 patients) or were faint (five of 18 patients) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement of the arterial walls in patients with radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> was significantly more prominent than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (P =.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of wall thickening and prominent ring enhancement of the wall of affected large cerebral arteries may be a diagnostic clue in differentiating radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
