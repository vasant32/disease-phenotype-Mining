<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These 11 cases have in common certain radiological and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriography shows segmental, multifocal and assymetrical stenoses involving the cerebral arteries between Willis' circle and the terminal arterioles and looking like "strings of sausages" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions disappear within one month and present the radiological characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> of medium caliber vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms are suggestive of meningeal haemorrhage or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebromeningeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> repetitive attacks of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> with obnubilation; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and transient neurological deficit may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>True meningeal haemorrhage confirmed by lumbar puncture is seen in nearly one half of the cases; it seems to be due to alterations in the blood-brain barrier induced by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral haematoma may develop, but the disease is usually benign and regresses spontaneously in a few days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the usual causes of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (intra-cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408,C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen disease</z:e>, allergic or toxic angitis) has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (notably spasm of ruptured arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) has been excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No aetiological factor common to the 11 cases reported has been elicited, although 6 of the patients had recently given birth and our 6 patients had benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> before or during the clinical manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the authors' opinion, the most rewarding line of research would be the role of short <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attacks of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
