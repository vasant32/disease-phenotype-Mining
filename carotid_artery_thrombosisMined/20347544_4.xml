<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This randomized trial compared the results of routine (RS) vs selective shunting (SS) based on stump pressure (SP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two-hundred CEA patients under general anesthesia were randomized into RS (98 patients) or SS (102 patients), where shunting was used only if systolic SP (SSP) was &lt;40 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and demographic characteristics were comparable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent immediate and 30-day postoperative duplex ultrasound follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention-to-treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 102 SS patients, 29 (28%) received shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indications for CEA were similar (42% symptomatic for RS; 47% for SS, P = .458) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean internal carotid artery diameter was comparable (5.5 vs 5.5 mm, P = .685) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean preoperative ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis was 76% and 38% for RS (P = .268) vs 78% and 40% for SS (P = .528) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean preoperative ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis was 79% and 56% in the shunted (P = .634) vs 78% and 34% in the nonshunted subgroup of SS patients (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean SSP was 55.9 mm Hg in RS vs 56.2 for SS (P = .915) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean SSP was 33 mm Hg in the shunted vs 65 in the nonshunted subgroup (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean clamp time in the nonshunted subgroup of SS was 32 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean shunt time was 35 minutes in RS and 33 in SS (P = .354) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean operative time was 113 minutes for RS and 109 for SS (P = .252), and 111 minutes in shunted and 108 in the nonshunted subgroup (P = .586) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mean arteriotomy length was 4.4 cm for RS and 4.2 for SS (P = .213) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 0% for RS vs 2% for SS (one major and one minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, both related to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; P = .498) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No patients died perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Combined perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were 2% in RS vs 2.9% in SS (P &gt; .99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The overall perioperative complication rates were 8.3% in RS (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> [MI], and 1 asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) vs 7.8% in SS (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, 1 MI, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>; P = .917) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RS and SS were associated with a low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Both methods are acceptable, and surgeons should select the method with which they are more comfortable </plain></SENT>
