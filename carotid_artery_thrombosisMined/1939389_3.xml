<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We documented the hemodynamic consequences of nonocclusive common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT) and tested the hypothesis that vasoactive substances capable of altering local CBF (LCBF) are released into the systemic circulation following cerebrovascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes after photochemically induced CCAT, an autoradiographic determination of LCBF was conducted with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In blood transfusion studies using donor and recipient rats, a 1-ml sample of thrombogenically activated blood (TAB) collected downstream from the forming <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was reinjected into a recipient rat 15 or 60 min before CBF study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of abnormal LCBF was documented in the ipsilateral hemisphere of CCAT rats and recipient rats receiving TAB 15 min before CBF study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic abnormalities included ischemic (less than 35% of control) and hyperemic (greater than 125% of control) foci and more global reductions (50-80% of control) in cortical and subcortical LCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Border zone hyperemia exceeding 2.0 ml/g/min was associated with focal sites of severe LCBF reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although recipient rats that received TAB 15 min before CBF study displayed similar hemodynamic abnormalities, LCBF values in 60-min recipient rats were not significantly different from control despite ischemic foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Humoral factors generated during CCAT appear to be responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> LCBF consequences of cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasoactive substances released from a thrombotic site, capable of regionally affecting vascular reactivity in a time-dependent fashion, might be expected to participate in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
