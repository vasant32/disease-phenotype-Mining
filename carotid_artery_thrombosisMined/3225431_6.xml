<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of blunt injury to the right internal carotid artery with subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, a finding that emphasizes the importance of obtaining carotid arteriograms in any patient with a focal neurologic deficit but a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We review the incidence, mechanism, presentation, and treatment of blunt carotid injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also stress the importance of observing for blunt carotid injuries in the patient with blunt cervical trauma in order to allow earlier intervention, since patient outcome is dependent on that early recognition and intervention </plain></SENT>
