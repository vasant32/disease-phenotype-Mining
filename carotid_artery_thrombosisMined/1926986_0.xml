<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the time-course of morphological changes after excimer laser treatment of atherosclerotic carotid arteries, laser angioplasty was performed in 34 rabbits after production of an intimal plaque (13 +/- 6 cell layers, 30 +/- 9% stenosis) using electrical stimulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after laser treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total or subtotal thrombotic occlusion was found in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was observed, but in 10 animals histological examination evidenced a partial ablation of the medial layer with signs of local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and local reduction of SMC in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five animals a stenosis of more than 50% of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> reduction was due to intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC), as determined by a monoclonal antibody against alpha-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the initial ablation, a continuous increase of intimal cell layers was found, from 7 +/- 6 cell layers (19 +/- 9% stenosis) at 7 days, to 28 +/- 5 cell layers (45 +/- 18% stenosis) at 28 days following excimer laser angioplasty (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 42 days no additional increase of intimal thickening occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that incidence and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> is comparable to the proliferative response of SMC following conventional balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
