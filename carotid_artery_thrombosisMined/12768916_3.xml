<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been revealed as one of the noninvasive tools possibly capable of identifying and characterizing high risk atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI may facilitate diagnosis, and guide and serially monitor interventional and pharmacological treatment of atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
