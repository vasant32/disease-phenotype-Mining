<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that retrovirus-mediated in vivo tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) gene transfer to the arterial wall would efficiently inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without causing significant changes in systemic hemostatic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) are usually caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, with consequent activation of the coagulation cascade and circulating platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor (TF) exposure represents an early event in this pathophysiologic sequence, leading to activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway and thrombin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor pathway inhibitor is a naturally occurring inhibitor of the extrinsic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, the gene coding for rabbit TFPI was inserted in a retroviral vector under control of a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-inducible promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replication-defective, infectious, recombinant retroviruses were used to transfect rabbit carotid arteries with either TFPI or a reporter gene--green fluorescent protein (GFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Retroviral-mediated arterial gene transfer of TFPI resulted in potent inhibition of intravascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in stenotic and injured rabbit carotid arteries, whereas transfection of the contralateral carotid artery with GFP had no effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in systemic hemostatic variables (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time) were observed when <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that retroviral-mediated transfection of the arterial wall with TFPI might represent an attractive approach for the treatment of thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
