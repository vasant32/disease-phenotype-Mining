<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and thrombin is a major inducer of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, several antithrombotic agents targeting thrombin have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported on a thrombin derivative prepared by dual chemical modifications designated as 'M-anhydrothrombin', which possessed both <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antiplatelet properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain a more potent antithrombotic thrombin derivative, we prepared a recombinant thrombin mutant and its chemically-modified derivative, and examined their antithrombotic efficacies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We prepared a thrombin mutant, 65A43A205A-Th (designated as "AAA-Th") in which Lys65(70)(1), and His43(57) and Ser205(195) were replaced by Ala, and its chemically-modified derivative at the carboxyl groups (designated as "M-AAA-Th") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M-AAA-Th possessed no enzymatic activity, but retained high affinity and specificity for factor VIII, and prolonged the APTT with a slight effect on PT and no effect on TT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation induced by PAR1 activation was also suppressed by M-AAA-Th </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, conventional thrombin inhibitors, argatroban and hirulog, substantially prolonged the TT rather than the APTT and the PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In thromboelastgraph assays, M-AAA-Th suppressed whole blood clotting in a dose-dependent manner, and its effect was synergistically enhanced in the presence of soluble thrombomodulin (s-TM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>M-AAA-Th also demonstrated a potent antithrombotic property in the FeCl(3)-induced carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model in guinea pigs with minimum effects on the APTT and PT and no prolongation of the TT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: M-AAA-Th may be a potent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antiplatelet thrombin derivative with differential affinity for factor VIII and PAR1 </plain></SENT>
