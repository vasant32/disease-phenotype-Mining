<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the thrombogenic effect of inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> production by aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) in carotid arteries of rabbits given 0, 3, 10, or 100 mg <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>/kg either 1, 3, 6, or 20 h beforehand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet accumulation onto injured carotid arteries was enhanced with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in a dose of 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A higher dose of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) had no further effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhanced thrombogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> persisted for at least 20 h and was associated with a decrease in vessel wall <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a strong inverse correlation (r = 0.55, P less than 0.01) between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> production and platelet accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the margin of safety in obtaining an antithrombotic effect of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and producing a potential thrombotic effect in arteries may not be as large as predicted by studies using cultured endothelial cells or experimentally induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in veins </plain></SENT>
