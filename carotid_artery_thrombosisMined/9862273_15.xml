<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its primary success rate is seriously handicapped by the high incidence of late restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the clinical and social importance of this proliferative process, new strategies are needed to prevent or reduce restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several animal models as well as different arteries have been used to study neointimal proliferation after arterial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of agents have shown to reduce neointimal proliferation after arterial injury in the carotids and iliac arteries of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, these results have not been replicated in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have compared the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and late response to vascular injury of the carotid and coronary arteries in the pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial injury was induced by performing balloon angioplasty of the carotid (elastic) and coronary (muscular) arteries in swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> platelet-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was evaluated by quantitation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-labeled platelets deposited on the injured segments 1 h after procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measurement of intimal area was performed by morphometry of the most stenotic cross-section at 28 days after balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Platelet deposition after mild and severe injury in carotids (4 +/- 1 and 56 +/- 13 x 10(6) platelets/cm2, respectively) and coronaries (15 +/- 5 and 141 +/- 20 x 10(6) platelets/cm2, respectively) are significantly greater in deep, than in mild injury (P &lt; 0.005), and significantly greater in coronary than in carotid arteries after deep injury (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Likewise, late neointima formation was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) after mild and severe injury in coronary (17 +/- 0.5 and 56 +/- 2%, respectively) than in carotid arteries (5 +/- 0.5 and 12 +/- 1%, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study emphasizes the importance of the animal species, the type of injury and the artery chosen for studies on restenosis post interventions </plain></SENT>
