<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous work has shown that rates of cerebral microemboli downstream of high-grade internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> are higher in recently symptomatic compared with asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, microembolic rates decline after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective investigation of 40 consecutive asymptomatic or recently symptomatic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for 70% to 95% internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> to determine the relationship between microembolic rate and pathoanatomic features of the carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler monitoring including automated emboli detection was performed preoperatively to assess the rate of cerebral microemboli of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding endarterectomy specimens were evaluated histologically with respect to the occurrence of plaque fissuring, intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, plaque ulceration, or intraluminal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were strong associations between plaque ulceration, intraluminal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and downstream cerebral microemboli (P &lt; or = .005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no correlations of microembolism with plaque fissuring or intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (P = .82 and P = .28, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ulceration and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the atheromatous plaque are the main sources of downstream cerebral microemboli in patients with high-grade internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data support the view that these pathoanatomic features may also play a key role in symptom development </plain></SENT>
