<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the perioperative outcomes and the immediate increases in size after patch closure, 140 carotid endarterectomies were randomized into one of three groups: direct no-patch closure, saphenous vein patch closure, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> patch closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (4.4%) experienced signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three cases this was transient and reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other four reexploration was undertaken and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was corrected by thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The condition of one of these patients deteriorated to a permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas the other patients made a complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications were more frequent in the no-patch group, but the differences between the groups were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of perioperative internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, and other morphologic abnormalities was assessed in 131 intravenous digital subtraction angiograms taken before the patient was discharged from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight (17.0%) of the endarterectomies in the no-patch group were narrowed by 30% to 50% diameter stenosis, whereas none of the patched arteries had more than 30% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the common or internal carotid artery to more than twice the measured diameter was absent in non-patched arteries but was present in seven (17.0%) saphenous patch closures and four (9.23%) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> patch closures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patch closure after carotid endarterectomy is less likely to cause stenosis in the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38866">tetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> patches resist <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> better than do saphenous vein patches and are less likely to become aneurysmal </plain></SENT>
