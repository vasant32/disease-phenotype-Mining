<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Occluded internal carotid arteries imply a high risk of ischaemic complications, but an "occluded" carotid artery is not always totally occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pseudo- and segmental occlusions can be detected angiographically, and increasingly non-invasively, and include a variety of morphologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: 128 patients with pseudo- or segmental occlusion were treated in a 13 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different types of pseudo- or segmental occlusion were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most cases a subtotal stenosis (near-occlusion) at the carotid bifurcation is the underlying lesion (type I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In approximately 35% the internal carotid artery is totally occluded at the bifurcation, but collaterals prevent downstream occlusion (type II), or retrograde flow from the circle of Willis and ophthalmic artery preserves a patent petrous part and siphon (type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 79% patency of the arteries could be restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients (2.3%) died perioperatively, nine (7%) developed ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (7 ipsilateral, 2 contralateral), one intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-mortality rate was 8.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (41 +/- 29.9 months) four patients (4.5%) experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (3 ipsilateral, 1 contralateral), one an intracranial (1.1%) haemorrhage and six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The annual ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 0.9%, the cumulative patency rate of the entire series 78% after 73 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the surgical management carries an increased risk of complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>) compared to conventional carotid endarterectomy it is likely that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk can be reduced at least for symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> diagnosed non-invasively should be confirmed angiographically to exclude pseudo- or segmental occlusion </plain></SENT>
