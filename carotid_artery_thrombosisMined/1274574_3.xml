<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This patient was a 62 year-old female who died about two months after sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, abnormal vascular networks termed as rete mirabile were observed to be collateral blood supplies among the cerebral regions with flow of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries, caused by long-standing obstruction of bilateral internal carotid arteries at the syphon level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphometrical analysis was done by measuring the length of internal elastic membrane of the internal carotid arteries in cross section, and comparing it with those of controlled persons of the same sex and age without any intracranial disorders and hypertensive histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result that no significant difference was observed between the former and the latter values suggested that the unusual cerebro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorder</z:e> of this case developed not on the base of congenital anomaly including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of internal carotid arteries or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> but as an acquired lesion established for a long time </plain></SENT>
