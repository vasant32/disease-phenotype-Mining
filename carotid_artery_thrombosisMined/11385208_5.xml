<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Abciximab, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50433">platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist</z:chebi>, prevents ischemic complications during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and was recently shown to open occluded vessels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> when used alone or in combination with other thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, abciximab was found to be safe and effective for the prevention of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the safety and efficacy of abciximab in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic cerebrovascular events is unknown at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe 3 patients who experienced ischemic cerebrovascular events with symptoms involving the middle cerebral artery territory while undergoing percutaneous angioplasty and stenting to their internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abciximab was administered to each patient within 10 min of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> as a bolus (0.25 mg/kg) into the ipsilateral common carotid artery followed by continuous intravenous infusion (9 microg/min) for 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients' symptoms resolved completely (by 25 min, 40 min and 5 h, respectively) with no further neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary observation suggests that abciximab may improve neurological outcome following middle cerebral artery ischemic events associated with carotid angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large prospective studies are warranted to establish the safety and efficacy of abciximab in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, either as a primary treatment modality or an adjunct to carotid angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
