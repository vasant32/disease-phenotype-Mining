<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On artificial surfaces, albumin pretreatment inhibits platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate albumin pretreatment on damaged vessel surfaces, 16 carotid arteries were obtained from 8 anesthetized dogs (11-15 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each artery was divided into 2 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each segment was mounted in a perfusion system, distended to 100 mmHg, and the middle section damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One segment was perfused with Tyrodes solution plus bovine albumin (5 g/100 ml), while the other segment was perfused only with Tyrodes solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 120 mins, both segments were perfused with whole citrated blood containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-111 labeled platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without albumin pretreatment, the proximal section contained 11 +/- 8 (X +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) percent of total blood radioactivity, while the damaged section contained 53 +/- 11 percent (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Albumin pretreatment significantly reduced platelet deposition in the damaged section (53 +/- 11 versus 9 +/- 6 percent, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, with albumin pretreatment the radioactive counts in the damaged section were not significantly different from the nondamaged proximal section (9 +/- 6 vs 8 +/- 7 percent, p greater than .8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quantitative examination of the scanning electron micrographs demonstrated significantly more platelet and red blood cell coverage of the damaged segments (60 +/- 12.8 percent) than of the albumin treated segments (12.9 +/- 5 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four additional experiments, we pretreated arterial segments with albumin for varying time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 15, 30 and 60 mins of albumin pretreatment, each artery was perfused with radiolabeled platelets and whole blood for 5 mins at 100 mmHg perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Radioactive evidence of platelet deposition on arterial segments treated with albumin for 15, 30, and 60 minutes was also significantly less than control (p less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Beneficial effects of albumin were apparent up to 30 mins of blood flow at 100 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that albumin may inhibit platelet and red blood cell deposition on damaged arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This could be an adjunct therapy for vessel preservation during artery bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
