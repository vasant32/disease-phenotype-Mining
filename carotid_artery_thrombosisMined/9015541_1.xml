<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few of these are suitable for both arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, an established <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> model was adapted through minimal technical adjustments to allow also the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standardized subintimal crush injury was performed to carotid arteries or femoral veins of hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> volumes were then quantified by direct morphometric measurements from serial microscopic sections or by on-line image analysis of light intensity changes from transilluminated vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e>, which was established within minutes of the trauma, disintegrated during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The life cycle of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was different in arteries and veins, but significant linear correlation (p &lt; 0.01) was found in both types of vessel between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> volumes measured by the two techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model can consequently be used for comparative in vivo <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> studies in small (approximately 1-mm) arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
