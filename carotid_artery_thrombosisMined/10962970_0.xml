<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Because of their high age and markedly increased co-morbidity, physicians and geriatricians are often cautious in their indications for carotid thromboendarterectomy (<z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>) in patients 80 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is these very patients who are subject to an exponentially increased risk of ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accidents</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the morbidity and mortality rates of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> in patients of this age group at one institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1994 and 1998, among a total of 912 TEAs, 46 had been performed in patients 80 years or older (15 women, 31 men): indications, diagnosis and associated diseases as well as perioperative complications were entered prospectively into a data-bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only one patient (2.2%) sustained a perioperative <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> and no patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients (6.5%) developed transitory neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had to have an emergency reoperation because of a postoperative carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had an intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> due to a hypersensitive carotid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no other serious cardiovascular or pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient sustained some oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> as a result of intraoperative retractor pull on a branch of the facial muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that even in patients of this age group carotid <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> can be performed with great safety </plain></SENT>
