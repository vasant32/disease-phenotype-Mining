<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1989 to 1994, 3593 open heart operations were performed in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 59 patients carotid endarterectomy for high grade stenosis was combined with the cardiac operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 68 (2%) focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 41 of which were considered minor and 14 major; 13 were lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the 27 major and lethal events was most probably an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> from the ascending aorta (6), from the ascending aorta or a cardiac valve (5), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the left heart (6), air (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and resuscitation (4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (1), preoperatively unknown but high grade internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (3), and a 50% stenosis of both internal carotid arteries preoperatively known but not operated on (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 2 minor but no major neurologic complications in patients undergoing a combined carotid and cardiac procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A wide indication for preoperative neuroangiologic examination, echocardiography and careful intraoperative management may help to identify sources of possible emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endarterectomy of high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is recommended simultaneously with the cardiac procedure </plain></SENT>
