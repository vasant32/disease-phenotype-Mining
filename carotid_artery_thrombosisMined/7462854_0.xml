<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The angiographic examination, including the study of the extra cranial arteries and the intra cerebral vessels, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has shown that a stenosis (greater than or equal to 90% of an internal carotid artery was the only lesion on 65 patients (53.3%) and that in 57 cases (46.7%) there were multiple lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>96 patients (76 symptomatic - 20 asymptomatic) were operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 patients (4.2%) died but the mortality was none in the group of 20 asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>19 patients refused the operation and we have noted 7 occlusions of the internal carotid artery and 2 patients died (10.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On 7 patients with a surgical contra indication we have noted 1 secondary occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have to consider a near total occlusion of the internal carotid artery as an emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its diagnosis by non invasive techniques must be followed by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy and angiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The carotid endarterectomy will respect the external carotid artery patency </plain></SENT>
