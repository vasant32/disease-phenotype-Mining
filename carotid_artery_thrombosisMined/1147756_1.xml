<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This caused reversal of flow in the graft and a symptomatic steal of blood via to the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An axilloaxillary graft restored forward flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a second patient, a steal occurred from the right carotid and vertebral systems into the distal carotid system of the left side that has been isolated by a proximal carotide <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A saphenous vein, used as a bypass from the subclavian to the carotid artery, restored <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the carotide system may be the low-pressure area responsible for the steal, although this is rarer than the subclavian </plain></SENT>
