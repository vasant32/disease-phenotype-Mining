<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) was utilized for monitoring cerebral function during and after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Latency, amplitude and central conduction time (CCT) of bilateral N13 (CV2) and N20 (C3', C4') were measured as an aid for management of anesthesia, surgical procedure and postoperative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed SSEP which is sensitive for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and could help the surgeon and anesthesiologist maintaining optimal cerebral perfusion, but yields little information about postoperative hyperperfusion state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides evaluating the efficacy of SSEP, we discussed the problems encountered during the SSEP monitoring </plain></SENT>
