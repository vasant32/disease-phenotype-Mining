<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies on this subject report the implantation of saphenous vein or <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patches, because polyester has always been considered to be a thrombogenic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the thrombogenicity of a knitted polyester patch passivated by fluoropolymer surface treatment (FPD patch), which experimental studies have demonstrated to be less thrombogenic than other materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This prospective, randomized study was performed in 22 patients who underwent CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients the arteriotomy was sutured directly, while in the other 11 an FPD patch was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' 111in-oxine labeled platelets were reinjected on the first postoperative day, and scintigraphies were performed after 4, 24, and 48 hr, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study confirmed that an FPD patch is no more thrombogenic than a simple carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The application of the patch, therefore, can be recommended to reduce restenosis without any adjunctive thromboembolic risk </plain></SENT>
