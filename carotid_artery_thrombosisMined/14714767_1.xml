<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the frequency of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in patients one year after heart valve replacement, to look for possible risk factors associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and for any correlation with cerebral events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred patients, 69 male and 31 female, mean age 66.3 +/- 12.4 years, were examined one year after heart valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients, 61% male and 39% female, mean age 62.5 +/- 8.7 years, who had undergone cardiovascular operations without heart valve pathology served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A newly developed microemboli detector, EMEX-25 (Hatteland Instrumentering, Norway) was used to detect <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> from both carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 61% of the valve patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correlation was found between the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, previous cardiovascular operations, emergency surgery and EuroSCORE (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the level of anticoagulation expressed as international normalization ratio (INR), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, serum-cholesterol, New York heart association (NYHA) class, gender, age, valve type or valve position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was not increased in seven patients who had experienced major (three) or minor (transient, four) cerebral events during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 30 nonvalve controls, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 46% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in valve patients as well as in nonvalve patients one year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In valve patients, a significant correlation was found between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and previous surgery, emergency surgery and EuroSCORE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and INR level or postoperative cerebral events </plain></SENT>
