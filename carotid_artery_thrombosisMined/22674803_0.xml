<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The kunitz <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> (KPI) domain of protease nexin-2 (PN2) is a potent, highly specific inhibitor of FXIa, suggesting its possible role in the inhibition of FXI-dependent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the effect of PN2KPI on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the murine carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of PN2KPI prolonged the clotting time of both human and murine plasma, and PN2KPI inhibited FXIa activity in both human and murine plasma in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intravenous administration of PN2KPI into WT mice dramatically decreased the progress of FeCl(3)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a similar initial rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation with and without PN2KPI treatment, the propagation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation after 10 minutes and the amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formed were significantly decreased in mice treated with PN2KPI injection compared with untreated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, the volume and fraction of ischemic brain tissue were significantly decreased in PN2KPI-treated compared with untreated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, inhibition of FXIa by PN2KPI is a promising approach to antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
