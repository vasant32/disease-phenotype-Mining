<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusions have a better clinical outcome and proportion of recanalization compared with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion after standard treatment with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: In a retrospective analysis of our prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> database between January 7, 1998, and January 30, 2002, we identified 36 consecutive patients who were treated with IV tPA within 3 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the distribution of a documented ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was recorded before tPA, at 24 hours, 3 days, and 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-month outcome was recorded by modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomographic angiography was obtained before tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of recanalization was assessed by transcranial Doppler and/or magnetic resonance angiography within 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients had <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and 17 had ICA-plus-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion before tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there was no difference in age and NIHSS at day 0 between the 2 groups, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> group had a lower day 3 NIHSS score compared with the ICA group (P=0.006) in an ANCOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients who had a <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion had lower day 1 and 3 NIHSS scores compared with the ICA group (P=0.04 and P=0.03, respectively; Wilcoxon rank sum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, NIHSS was significantly lower in patients who recanalized on days 1 and 3 (P=0.004 and P=0.003 respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When we adjusted for NIHSS score at day 0 in an ANCOVA, the adjusted mean was lower in the group that recanalized compared with the group that did not recanalize (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between the proportion of recanalization in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> group (15 of 17 recanalized, 88%) at 3 days after tPA compared with that of the ICA group (5 of 16 recanalized, 31%; P=0.001, Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 3-month modified Rankin scale was not different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite comparable age and NIHSS scores before IV tPA, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions have lower day 1 and 3 NIHSS scores and higher proportion of recanalization compared with ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A combined IV/intra-arterial or mechanical thrombolysis may be needed to achieve early recanalization in ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
