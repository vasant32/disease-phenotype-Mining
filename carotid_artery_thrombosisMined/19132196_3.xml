<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi> level or P2Y(12) receptor occupancy (RO) could be optimized to better balance the efficacy and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> effects of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37942">thienopyridines</z:chebi> and reduce the response variability in rabbits </plain></SENT>
