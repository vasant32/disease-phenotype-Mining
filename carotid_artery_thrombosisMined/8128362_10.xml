<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective analysis of patients treated for nonpenetrating injury of the carotid arteries in our hospital from 1985 to 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men, with ages ranging from 19 to 55 years) had eight injuries to the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient was asymptomatic; another patient had neurologic symptoms unrelated to the carotid artery injury; severe neurologic deficits developed in the remaining five patients, of whom three died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms occurred immediately in one patient, after a few days in two patients, and after a few weeks in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial damage included dissection (four cases), pseudoaneurysm (two cases), local <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> (one case), and occlusion (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment consisted of aneurysmorraphy and extraintracranial bypass in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention was not considered in the other patients because of the severity of their neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides collective reviews, very few series pertaining to this pathologic condition exist in the literature; however, some report good overall results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These reports comprise a high proportion of asymptomatic cases; the internal injury is usually only discovered incidentally on thoracic aortograms or by scanning the neck during head computed tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nonpenetrating trauma to the carotid arteries carries significant morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Wide-scale screening for carotid lesions in victims of blunt trauma would be necessary to determine the true incidence and gravity of this pathologic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A search for carotid artery injury should be performed in patients with a history of neck or head trauma to detect whether the correction of any lesion would lead to improvement or prevention of neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
