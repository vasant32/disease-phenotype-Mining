<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a devastating complication, may be partially circumvented by shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, routine shunt use is not without complications and does not benefit every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study is designed to determine whether CEA under general anesthesia, without cerebral monitoring, can be safely done with shunting only in the presence of poor internal carotid artery back-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or contralateral carotid occlusion or critical stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The medical records of 995 carotid operations were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subset of 117 operations was performed on 112 patients using selective shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed and outcomes compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the selective shunt group, indications for redo operations (n=13) were recurrent asymptomatic high-grade stenosis in 69% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indications for primary CEA (n=104) were asymptomatic high-grade stenosis in 59%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in 36%, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 3%, and global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A selective shunt was used in 29% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptomatic and 11% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No cerebral monitoring was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no permanent cranial nerve injuries, and there was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.8%) from postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a shunted patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average length of stay was 1.6 days for the non-shunt group and 2.2 days for the shunt group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The routine shunt group (n=878) had an overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 0.7%, no permanent cranial nerve deficits, and a mean hospital stay of 2.6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CEA under general anesthesia with selective shunting can be performed safely without cerebral monitoring </plain></SENT>
