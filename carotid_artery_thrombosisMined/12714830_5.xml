<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Tissue Factor/Factor VIIa (TF/FVIIa) complex is an attractive target for pharmacological interruption of thrombin generation and hence blood coagulation, as this complex is the initiation point of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TF is a cell membrane-associated protein that interacts with soluble FVIIa to activate factors IX and X resulting in a cascade of events that leads to thrombin generation and eventual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this non-randomized study was to evaluate XK1, a specific protein inhibitor of TF/FVIIa, and compare antithrombotic efficacy and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> propensity to a previously described Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor (SC-83157/SN429) and a direct-acting thrombin inhibitor (SC-79407/L-374087) in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> saline-treated animals experienced occlusion of the carotid artery due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation within 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats treated with XK1 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation with full antithrombotic efficacy and no change in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time or total blood loss at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg, i.v. administered over a 60 minute period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FXa inhibition with SC-83157 resulted in complete inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg, i.v.; however, this effect was associated with substantial blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombin inhibition with SC-79407 also afforded complete protection from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and occlusion at a dose of 2.58 mg/kg, i.v., and like SC-83157, was associated with substantial blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data imply that TF/FVIIa inhibition confers protection from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without concomitant changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, indicating that this target (TF/FVIIa) may provide improved separation of efficacy vs. <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> side-effects than interruption of coagulation by directly inhibiting either FXa or thrombin </plain></SENT>
