<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversy exists as to the relative efficacy of the 2 techniques in preventing late events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry recruited &gt; 68,000 outpatients ≥ 45 years of age with established atherothrombotic disease or ≥ 3 risk factors for atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with CAS or CEA were chosen and followed up prospectively for the occurrence of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Propensity score matching was performed to assemble a cohort of patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> baseline covariates would be well balanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tertiary outcome was a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the individual outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 68 236 patients with atherothrombosis, 3412 patients (5%) had a history of carotid artery revascularization (70% asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>), 1025 (30%) with CAS and 2387 (70%) with CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Propensity score analyses matched 836 CAS patients with 836 CEA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of 2 years of follow-up, in the propensity score-matched cohort, CAS was associated with a risk similar to CEA for the primary (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 1.26), secondary (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.96), and tertiary (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.01) composite outcome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.00), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.79 to 2.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world cohort of patients with a history of carotid artery revascularization, CAS was comparable to CEA for late outcomes </plain></SENT>
