<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical and pathological modifications linked to an increasing waiting list in our region and the related medico-legal implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neurological symptoms that occurred during the waiting period were evaluated in 282 out of 491 patients placed on the waiting list for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> less than 80% or without an unstable plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other 202 patients cancelled their booking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> was evaluated by duplex scanning in 116 patients who had a duplex evaluation in our Department both at booking and at the time of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a mean waiting period of 8.9 months was 2.6% in symptomatic patients and 1.5% in asymptomatic, respectively; 39 (13.8%) patients experienced an ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and 4.2% a carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (25% of which symptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The crude mortality-rate was 2.4% with a 1% of related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative actuarial hard end points rate (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) was 7.8% at 12 months and 19.8% at 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study gives us data about the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high morbidity and mortality-rate related to this lesion and particularly their occurrence within the first 3 months stress the urgency of treatment, and of the planning of specialized Departments in relation to the real incidence of the pathology in order to avoid medico-legal consequences </plain></SENT>
