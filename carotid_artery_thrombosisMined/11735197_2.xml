<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There is limited understanding of the reasons underlying post-CEA carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinicians have often implicated operative technique, such as patch type or shunting, however the evidence for this is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied whether it is the patients themselves who are prothrombotic, by studying the rates of emboli detection in patients undergoing bilateral CEAs at separate time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients (3 women) underwent CEA during the study period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were taking aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CEA was performed in a standardised manner throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored for 3 h postoperatively using a 2 MHz fixed head probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Those patients who had no emboli detected on TCD after the first operation, had a mean of 2.5 emboli after the second operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with emboli after the first operation had a mean of 41.3 emboli after the second CEA (MWU test, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dose of aspirin administered did not affect emboli rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation of the number of emboli detected after the first CEA with the second CEA gave a significant correlation ( p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There appear to be factors relating to the patient that places some individuals at an increased risk of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further elucidation of these factors may enable more effective, targeted therapy to be applied in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
