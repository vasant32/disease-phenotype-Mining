<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inhaled ultrafine particles trigger peripheral thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have analyzed the systemic prothrombotic risk following <z:mp ids='MP_0001861'>lung inflammation</z:mp> induced by pulmonary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50594">carbon nanotubes</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNTs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intratracheal instillation in Swiss mice of 200 and 400 microg of multiwall ground <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNTs</z:chebi> triggered substantial lung neutrophil, but not macrophage influx, 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection of circulating platelet-leukocyte conjugates exclusively 6 h after <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi> instillation pointed to early but transient activation of circulating platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, elevated plasma procoagulant microvesicular tissue factor activity was found in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>-exposed but not in saline-exposed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at 24 h, both the tail and jugular vein <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times were prolonged in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>-exposed but not in saline-exposed mice, arguing against strong <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>-induced platelet activation at this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, at 24 h, enhanced peripheral thrombogenicity was detected in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>-exposed but not in saline-exposed mice, via quantitative photochemically induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P-selectin neutralization abrogated platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation and microvesicular tissue factor generation, and abolished the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>-induced thrombogenicity amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the weak vascular injury-triggered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in saline-treated mice was not affected by P-selectin neutralization at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mild <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001861'>lung inflammation</z:mp> translates via rapid but mild and transient activation of platelets into P-selectin-mediated systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte activation leads to tissue factor release, in turn eliciting <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced procoagulant activity and an associated prothrombotic risk </plain></SENT>
