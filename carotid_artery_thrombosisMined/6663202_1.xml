<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 22% (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>35% had a complete recovery of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without any sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>6 were better after intervention, 3 worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long term mortality is 10 patients with 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference can be observed on life table of the survivors with reference to recent medical series, 60% at five years, 36% at ten years, 28% 13 at years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A review of 30 studies of the literature (1,046 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>) shows a 17% global mortality, with 50% of good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality of surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusion is lower in recent papers (inferior 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This progression seems to be related to the selection of the indications of surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (shorter delay, early diagnosis with non-invasive procedures, post-operative management) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is that a surgical therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal carotid artery cannot be systemically rejected </plain></SENT>
