<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous administration of FR171113 (0.1-3.2 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ED50 value of FR171113 for platelet aggregation was 0.49 mg/kg s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, FR171113 did not have an inhibitory effect on <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>- or collagen-induced platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hour after FR171113 treatment at 1.0 mg/kg s.c., significant inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> without a prolongation of thrombin time or coagulation time was seen in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi>-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, FR171113 did not prolong <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time even at 32 mg/kg s.c., which is a much higher dose than that required in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that FR171113 has desirable antiplatelet effects both in vitro and in vivo and that its in vivo antithrombotic activity is efficacious without causing a prolongation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
