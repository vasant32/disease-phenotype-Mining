<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monitoring cerebral function is difficult under general anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the monitoring of awareness and neurological deficit is very easy under regional anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the requirement for arterial shunting during endarterectomy performed under cervical epidural anaesthesia, to analyse the neurological events and to compare the value of clinical and electroencephalographic monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cervical epidural anesthesia was performed with 0.375% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> and 100-150 micrograms fentanyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 19 high risk patients, a one-channel electroencephalographic filter processor (Cerebral function monitor, Critikon) was placed over the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, it was estimated, on angiographic and Doppler data, that 18 patients needed an arterial shunt for carotid clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An arterial shunt was in fact inserted during surgery in only four patients, because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> after carotid clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient obnubilation was observed during carotid clamping in three other patients; it disappeared on unclamping in two, and on increasing blood pressure in the third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An additional patient suffered from a very short loss of awareness after declamping, due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cerebral function monitor never documented false positive results, but failed to detect one out of every five neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Controlateral carotid occlusion and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were documented to correlate with peroperative neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cervical epidural anaesthesia, which maintains consciousness during surgery, reduced in high-risk patients the need for arterial shunting as well as that for the analysis of neurological events </plain></SENT>
