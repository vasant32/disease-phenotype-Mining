<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional findings were observed in 94 of these patients who revealed an obliteration of the internal carotid artery or cerebral ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diseases of the ear were excluded clinically and audiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean hearing loss shows a sensory-neural high-tone loss in the tone audiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The range of scatter increases proportionately to the increase in tone loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If compared with the physiologic examination of geriatric patients, the total word comprehension and minimal discrimination loss in the speech audiogram point towards a pathologic impairment of hearing in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total word comprehension amounts to 251.20% in the 51-60 age group, 250.40% in the persons 61-70 years of age, 180.96% for the 71-80 age group and 131.67% for those over 80 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The minimal discrimination loss comprises 4.00% for the 51-60 age group, 4.19% for the 61-70 group, 21.35% for 71-80 age bracket and 35.62% for those over 80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the strength of these findings, an arterial sclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> should be considered as one of the multifactorial genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Special attention should be focussed on decompensation of the total word comprehension and minimal discrimination loss before the age of eighty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This would contribute towards a differentiation of physiologic and pathologic hearing diseases in old age </plain></SENT>
