<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lectin-like oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (LOX1) is an important cell surface receptor for the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose is to clarify the relationships of LOX1 and atherosclerotic factors for the vulnerability of carotid plaque and preoperative echogenic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined LOX1 expression, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2,9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-2 by immunohistochemical analysis using carotid endarterectomy specimens obtained from 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups were divided into stable plaque group A and vulnerable plaque group B by preoperative echogenic findings of carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelial immunoreactivity was calculated, and the immunohistochemical findings were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LOX1 was remarkably expressed, especially in smooth muscle cells in vulnerable plaque and colocalized in MMP-9 positive cells and apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> LOX1, MMP-2,9, and TIMP2 were remarkably expressed in the subendothelial layer in group B compared with group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endothelial LOX1 index was 63.75 +/- 4.92 in group A and 83.0 +/- 5.02 in group B (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The endothelial MMP-2 index was 24.38 +/- 5.50 in group A and 32.83 +/- 6.79 in group B (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The endothelial MMP-9 index was 46.13 +/- 6.31 in group A and 59.17 +/- 2.14 in group B (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The endothelial TIMP-2 index had no significant difference between two groups (p = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LOX-1 may play an important role in the progression of vulnerable carotid plaque and might regulate vulnerable plaque formation in cooperation with MMPs and TIMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endothelial MMP-2 might suppress TIMP-2 activation in vulnerable plaques </plain></SENT>
