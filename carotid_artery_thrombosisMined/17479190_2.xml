<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interaction between the plasmin-SAK complex and plasminogen was investigated using synthesized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, which were constructed according to the amino acid sequence of the SAK molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A synthetic nonadecapeptide (SAK22-40) corresponding to Glu22-Leu40 by the SAK molecule enhanced the activation of Glu-plasminogen by the plasmin-SAK complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of IAsys resonant mirror biosensor showed that SAK22-40 bound to Glu-plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This binding was completely inhibited by IgG against the B-chain in the plasminogen molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But, this binding was not inhibited by IgG against lysine-binding sites (LBS) of the A-chain in the plasminogen molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The substitution of Lys35 with Ala in SAK22-40 did not enhance the activation of Glu-plasminogen by the plasmin-SAK complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When SAK22-40 was administrated in a mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, earlier recanalization was observed than in mice with vehicle administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, a newly synthesized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, SAK22-40 enhanced Glu-plasminogen activation and induced effective thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
