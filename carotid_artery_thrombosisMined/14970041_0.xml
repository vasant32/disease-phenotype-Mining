<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To develop a technique for site-specific placement of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> of predetermined volume in an animal model for the purpose of evaluating methods of intravascular thrombolysis and clot retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six swine were subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> injection bilaterally in the ascending pharyngeal artery (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each animal underwent transfemoral angiography while under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nondetachable balloon catheter and a 3-French microcatheter were then advanced into the common carotid artery through a 7-French guide catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the microcatheter in the proximal <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and the balloon inflated proximally, a bolus of preformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> composed of 0.9 mL of autologous blood and 0.1 mL of bovine thrombin (200 IU/mL) was injected through the microcatheter while local flow arrest was maintained for 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The balloon was deflated and removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occluded arteries were observed by serial angiography for 3 hr and then resected for gross examination and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> was occluded angiographically and did not recanalize during the 3-hr observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persistent, proximal progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> to the superior thyroid artery origin occurred in three animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gross inspection revealed that the resected arteries contained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the proximal <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> but not in the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination revealed organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, without evidence of intimal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our model provides a simple, reliable method for site-specific injection of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> of predetermined volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Site-specific placement is important for evaluation of the efficacy of thrombolytic agents and techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Angiographic evidence of brain revascularization can be used to grade revascularization and clot volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ability to specifically localize and estimate clot volume makes our model well suited for the evaluation and comparison of thrombolytic agents and endovascular techniques </plain></SENT>
