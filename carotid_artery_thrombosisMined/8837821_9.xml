<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic carotid arteries often contain fresh or partially digested intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before we cross certain carotid bifurcation lesions with angioplasty catheters, we deliver 100,000 to 200,000 units of urokinase in an attempt to digest loose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have witnessed changes in the angiographic appearance of the diseased portion of the vessel after urokinase treatment, such as widening of the lumen, that suggest clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present two patients who had symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed irregular narrowing of the internal carotid artery origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient was selected for angioplasty instead of carotid endarterectomy because of severe cardiac risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other patient had major angiographic risk factors manifested by poor collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The angiographic findings and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> led us to suspect the presence of soft, loose plaque debris or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed thrombolysis with urokinase before angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiography showed widening of the arterial lumen and smoothing of the plaque profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subsequent angioplasty and stent placement were uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial thrombolysis can produce a change in the angiographic appearance of symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the cervical carotid artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Digestion of intralesional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> may provide a safer environment for deployment of endovascular remodeling devices by decreasing the likelihood of embolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We believe thrombolysis should be done before angioplasty in select patients </plain></SENT>
