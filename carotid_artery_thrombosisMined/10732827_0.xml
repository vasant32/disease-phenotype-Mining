<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been emphasized that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (AmF) is caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> due to atheromatous lesions of the extracranial carotid artery (EC-CA) in Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been few studies of AmF in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical and pathophysiologic features of AmF in 43 Japanese AmF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients presented with AmF from a group of 2,056 Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated angiographic and transcranial Doppler findings, precipitating factors, medical treatment and prognosis, to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of AmF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic findings revealed an intracranial lesion in 22 patients (51%), extracranial lesion in 16 (37%), and no abnormality in 5 (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) examined by the transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antegrade flow in 24 patients and reversed flow in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Precipitating factors for AmF were seen in 7 out of 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding the pathogenesis of AmF, the micro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> originated from the internal carotid artery (ICA) in 25 patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was via the external carotid artery (ECA) in 7, the hemodynamic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular insufficiency in 6 patients showed various atheromatous changes in the intracranial carotid artery (IC-CA) or EC-CA, and the cause was unknown in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this series of patients, AmF was mainly caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> from IC-CA atheromatous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Micro-thromboemboli from the ECA or hemodynamic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular insufficiency, although less frequent, should also be considered as possible etiologies for AmF </plain></SENT>
