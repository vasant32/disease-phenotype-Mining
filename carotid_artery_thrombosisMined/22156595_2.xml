<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is known that the complement and coagulation systems interact, no studies have investigated the specific role or mechanisms of lectin-mediated coagulation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FeCl(3) treatment resulted in intra-arterial occlusive thrombogenesis within 10 min in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and C2/factor B-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL)-null and MBL-associated serine protease (MASP)-1/-3 knockout (KO) mice had significantly decreased FeCl(3)-induced thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reconstitution with recombinant human (rh) MBL restored FeCl(3)-induced thrombogenesis in MBL-null mice to levels comparable to WT mice, suggesting a significant role of the MBL/MASP complex for in vivo coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, whole blood aggregation demonstrated increased MBL/MASP complex-dependent platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, MBL/MASP complexes were captured on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi>-coated plates, and cleavage of a chromogenic thrombin substrate (S2238) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed no significant differences in S2238 cleavage between WT, C2/factor B-null, MBL-A(-/-), or MBL-C(-/-) sera; however, MBL-null or MASP-1/-3 KO mouse sera demonstrated significantly decreased S2238 cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>rhMBL alone failed to cleave S2238, but cleavage was restored when rMASP-1 was added to either MASP-1/-3 KO sera or rhMBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicate that MBL/MASP complexes, and specifically MASP-1, play a key role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
