<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Activated platelets can be found on the surface of inflamed, rupture-prone and ruptured plaques as well as in intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are key players in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we describe the construction of a radiolabeled single-chain antibody targeting the LIBS-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of activated platelets to selectively depict platelet activation and wall-adherent non-occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a mouse model with nuclear imaging using in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography as well as small animal SPECT-CT for in vivo analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: LIBS as well as an unspecific control single-chain antibody were labeled with (111)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi> ((111)In) via bifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> ( = (111)In-LIBS/(111)In-control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoradiography after incubation with (111)In-LIBS on activated platelets in vitro (mean 3866 ± 28 DLU/mm(2), 4010 ± 630 DLU/mm(2) and 4520 ± 293 DLU/mm(2)) produced a significantly higher ligand uptake compared to (111)In-control (2101 ± 76 DLU/mm(2), 1181 ± 96 DLU/mm(2) and 1866 ± 246 DLU/mm(2)) indicating a specific binding to activated platelets; P&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Applying these findings to an ex vivo mouse model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> revealed a significant increase in ligand uptake after injection of (111)In-LIBS in the presence of small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> compared to the non-injured side, as confirmed by histology (49630 ± 10650 DLU/mm(2) vs. 17390 ± 7470 DLU/mm(2); P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings could also be reproduced in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SPECT-CT analysis of the injured carotid artery with (111)In-LIBS resulted in a significant increase of the target-to-background ratio compared to (111)In-control (1.99 ± 0.36 vs. 1.1 ± 0.24; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Nuclear imaging with (111)In-LIBS allows the detection of platelet activation in vitro and ex vivo with high sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using SPECT-CT, wall-adherent activated platelets in carotid arteries could be depicted in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results encourage further studies elucidating the role of activated platelets in plaque pathology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and might be of interest for further developments towards clinical application </plain></SENT>
