<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A placebo controlled, double blind, randomised protocol was used, 18 patients were treated with co-dergocrine and compared to placebo (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Co-dergocrine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in platelet deposition, PUR decreased from 1.28 +/- 0.05 before treatment to 1.25 +/- 0.06 on day 5 of therapy with a statistically significant (p less than 0.001) in the paired comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group the corresponding changes from 1.29 +/- 0.04 before to 1.28 +/- 0.04 did not show a p-value of less than 0.05 in paired comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet half-life (72 +/- 11 before vs. 76 +/- 11 hours after 5 days of co-dergocrine treatment) showed a statistically significant (p less than 0.001) prolongation, whereas in the placebo group no relevant change of T/2 was observed (71 +/- 10 before vs. 72 +/- 10 hours on day 5, p greater than 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relevant effects on <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation, platelet-release reaction, platelet aggregate ratio, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> plasma levels and thrombin-induced <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-formation could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that co-dergocrine decreased in-vivo platelet residence time to <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Co-dergocrine may thereby be of benefit in prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, but also of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in man </plain></SENT>
