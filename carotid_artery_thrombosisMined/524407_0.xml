<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three weeks post-ligation, the animals were killed and histopathological sections of the ligated artery demonstrated myointimal proliferation without occlusion in the normotensive S-D rats but myointimal proliferation with occlusion in the severely hypertensive SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Breeder S-D rats with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> manifested a high incidence of total occlusion by combined myointimal proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severely hypertensive breeder SHR manifested a high incidence of massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> containing cholesterol clefts causing total occlusion of the injured artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the hormonal-metabolic milieu conditions the morphologic response of the arterial wall to injury </plain></SENT>
