<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physiological methods focus on blood circulation time or on the pulsating changes in blood pressure, blood velocity, blood vessel diameter and cerebral volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the reliability of two pressure-dependent methods, namely ophthalmodynamography and ophthalmodynamometry, for the detection of haemodynamically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correct results were found in 78--82% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmodynamography, and the advantage of combining this method with ophthalmodynamometry, are more extensively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although in recent years attention has been focussed on the study of the blood velocity pulsations with the Doppler technique, maximal diagnostic efficacy can be expected from a combination of pressure and flow wave studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A way to compare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the information contained in the curves can be found in the technique of Fourier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results obtained by Fourier analysis of the ophthalmodynamographic curves are presented </plain></SENT>
