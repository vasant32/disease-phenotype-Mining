<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> occurred in seven patients (7%) including five under cervical block anesthesia (6%) and two under general anesthesia (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients (2.1%) died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in one case and hyperperfusion syndrome in one case </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that neurologic mortality/morbidity is not higher after early controlateral carotid endarterectomy than unilateral endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
