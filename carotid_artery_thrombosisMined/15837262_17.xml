<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Plaque rupture followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation is a fundamental pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the adhesive interaction between platelets and leukocytes via P-selectin is known to mediate platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, the true function of P-selectin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (P(+/+)) and P-selectin-deficient (P(-/-)) mice with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> (FeCl(3))-induced carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model, we measured in vivo platelet P-selectin expression and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>)-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also measured ex vivo <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced whole blood aggregations and their size distribution by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Time to thrombotic occlusion was longer in P(-/-) mice than in P(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous reflow after total thrombotic occlusion was observed in 8 of 10 P(-/-) mice but not in any P(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation was not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced ex vivo whole blood aggregation was inhibited in P(-/-) mice compared to P(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FeCl(3) application increased in vivo expressions of platelet P-selectin in P(+/+) mice but not in P(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of leukocytes within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> was less in P(-/-) mice than in P(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In flow cytometric analysis of size distribution of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced whole blood aggregates, the number of large aggregates was less in P(-/-) mice than in P(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using platelet and leukocyte fluorescence makers, the large aggregates were confirmed as platelet-leukocyte aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Platelet P-selectin plays an important role in arterial thrombogenesis by forming large stable platelet-leukocyte aggregates </plain></SENT>
