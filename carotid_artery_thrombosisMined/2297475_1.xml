<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> disks have been seeded by endothelial cells from bovine aortic origin and from fresh human greater omentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various pretreatments permit comparison of six different experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The benefit of poly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L lysine</z:chebi>, laminin, fibronectin and previous astrocyte cell seeding is shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell proliferation was assessed daily, using trypan blue in Malassez cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell identification was performed by class I MHC antigen characterization and factor VIII staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo, 4 mm <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> arterial prostheses were implanted as carotid interpositions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi>, both in vitro and in vivo, failed to demonstrate a satisfactory hemocompatibility of the material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, previous treatment of <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> with laminin, fibronectin, and astrocyte cell seeding improves the biologic characteristics of the raw material </plain></SENT>
