<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were males their age ranging between the 5th and 8th decades of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a single case, the neurological examination showed secondary left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and recent right <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of remittent type whereas the other 5 patients had only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions were revealed by duplex system echotomography (Aloka-Hellige Model SSD-630) and spectral analysis of Doppler signal (Vasoscan-Sonicaid) and were later confirmed by bilateral carotid arteriography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intracranial circulation was also watched by noninvasive methods using the spectral analysis of the Doppler signal with pulsed wave on TC-2 64-B apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for the modalities of blood flow compensatory mechanisms by the circle of Willis, it may be noted that in none of the patients investigated did the collateral supply observe a "mathematical model" </plain></SENT>
