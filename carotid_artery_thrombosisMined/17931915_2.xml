<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is well established, however, that between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is less well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Isolated cases</z:hpo> have been reported and chemotherapy has been implicated as a cause though its significance compared with the malignant disease process itself is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the outcome of patients with malignant disease who present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Details of patients with malignant disease who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, 16 presented in the last four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> involved the leg in 19 cases and the arm in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients also had venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and one had a carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent operative treatment for their <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five out of six thromboembolectomies and two out of three bypass procedures failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve had conservative or palliative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcome was generally poor, two patients had major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> and seventeen died at median follow-up of eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival rate from the time of presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was 50% at three months and 17% at one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with critical limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> due to atherosclerotic disease have an expected survival of approximately 80% at one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with malignant disease is far worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is an agonal event in many of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Conservative or palliative treatment may be the most appropriate management </plain></SENT>
