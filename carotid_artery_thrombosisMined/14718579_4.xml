<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic activity of SanOrg123781A has been studied in a new mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was induced by the application of an electrical current to the adventitial surface of a carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this model, antiplatelet agents such as the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg, p.o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 h before stimulation) and the GpIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR121566A [3-(N-[4-(4-[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48090">amino(imino)methyl</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]-N-[1-(carboxymethyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30768">propionic acid</z:chebi>, trihydrochloride] (0.3 mg/kg, i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5 min before stimulation) strongly prolonged the time to occlusion (TTO) (761 and 473% increases, respectively), whereas aspirin was devoid of antithrombotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg, i.v.), the low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> enoxaparin (20 mg/kg, i.v.), and the synthetic, antithrombin-dependent inhibitor of factor Xa fondaparinux (10 mg/kg, i.v.) were also active in this model (742, 707, and 602% TTO increases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, SanOrg123781A was active at much lower doses than the other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> (554% increase in TTO at 0.3 mg/kg, i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5 min before stimulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low doses of SanOrg123781A administered in combination with low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> led to a marked increase in TTO, which was statistically more important than the additive effects of the two compounds given alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SanOrg123781A exerts a potent antithrombotic activity in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> when compared with reference compounds and show that the combination of SanOrg123781A with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> leads to a marked synergistic antithrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
