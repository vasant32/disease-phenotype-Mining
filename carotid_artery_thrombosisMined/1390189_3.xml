<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tears appeared in the internal elastic lamina of the arteries 3 days post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overlying endothelium exhibited cytoplasmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>, loss of argyrophilia of cell borders, and at times attenuated endothelial cells bridging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> covered regions of denudation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early endothelial lesions repaired rapidly and were found only 3-7 days post-operatively despite progressive increase in frequency and extent of tears and the development of interconnecting longitudinal tears with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following repair endothelial cells over the tears were small with hyperchromatic nuclei and oriented mostly parallel to the arterial axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cell density overlying these elastic tissue tears increase to three times that in contralateral arteriotomized common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These endothelial changes were sharply delineated by the margins of the elastic tears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell density over the tears reached its maximum 9-11 days post-operatively with mitotic figures both in the floor of the tears and over islands of residual elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With time the cell density progressively diminished and endothelial cells assumed a more conventional elongated spindle shape </plain></SENT>
