<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The aggregation rate of platelets induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and inhibition rate of Nim were measured by the change of light transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effect of Nim on <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> time was measured by electric stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effect of Nim on the contents of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> in serum was measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nim 4.5, 9, 18, and 36 mg.kg-1.d-1 ig for 4 d restrained the platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IC50 (95% confidence limits) was 26 (9-44) mg.kg-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nim 4.5, 9, and 18 mg.kg-1.d-1 ig for 4 d markedly prolonged the time of thrombotic occlusion in carotid artery induced by electric stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nim 9 and 18 mg.kg-1.d-1 improved the imbalance of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> in serum after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nim was a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, which was partially concerned with the improved balance of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
