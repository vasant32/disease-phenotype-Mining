<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients resting studies showed no significant difference in hemispheric perfusion and a 47% flow increase after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> on the side with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the obstructed side in 8 patients the hemispheric flow increased equally indicating a sufficient and adequate intracerebral collateral circulation and capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients a significant redistribution of brain flow occurred with diminished increase on the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This flow pattern indicates an inadequate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> response and insufficient collateral capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rCBF stimulation test identifies patients with a restricted collateral capacity and these patients could benefit from a surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
