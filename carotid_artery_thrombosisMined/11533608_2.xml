<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The feasibility and clinical outcome of intra-arterial thrombolysis followed by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intra-arterial thrombolysis and CEA were performed in four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scans, cerebral angiograms, and the severity of carotid plaques were examined, and the patients' clinical outcome was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>; 3 patients were alert, and 1 patient was lethargic at the time of hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New lesions were not shown by means of the initial computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ICA occlusion was indicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients by means of cerebral angiograms; in three patients, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation was manifested in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial recanalization of the occluded ICA was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with severe residual ICA stenosis underwent an emergency CEA soon after thrombolysis; the other two patients were treated by means of CEA in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or chromic stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plaque rupture and intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients recovered completely, and restenosis of the ICA was not shown by means of follow-up angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial thrombolysis followed by CEA may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The optimal timing of CEA remains controversial </plain></SENT>
