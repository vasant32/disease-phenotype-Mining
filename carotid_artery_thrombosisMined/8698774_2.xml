<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the carotid artery has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study reviews the etiology and analyzes the management options of post carotid endarterectomy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diagnosis was made using oculopneumop-lethysmography (OPG/Gee), duplex ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scanning, and carotid exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was identified as carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 19/32 patients (59%) and non-carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Management options included nine patients who underwent selective carotid exploration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a thrombosed carotid; mandatory exploration-six were explored and three had a thrombosed carotid artery; and 17 patients had no exploration (medical treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had a positive OPG, 13 were confirmed to have carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had a negative OPG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OPG had an overall accuracy of 95% in detecting postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (89% specificity and 100% sensitivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with thrombosed carotids and patients with positive OPGs had more severe neurological deficits than those with non-thrombosed carotids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The final neurological status of the 12 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> who underwent thrombectomy and patch angioplasty was improved (7/12) in contrast to the seven patients who did not undergo a thrombectomy (1/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven of nine patients had a complete or good recovery when thrombectomy was done within two hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in contrast to 0/3 after two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven of ten patients with Grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (moderate) had a good recovery after carotid exploration and thrombectomy in contrast to 0/2 for Grade III (severe) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the most common cause of post carotid endarterectomy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, can be detected by OPG/Gee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Immediate carotid exploration for patients with Grade I or II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, when <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is demonstrated, can improve the results of carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
