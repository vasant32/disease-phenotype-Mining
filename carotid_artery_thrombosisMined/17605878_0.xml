<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed to investigate the potential effect of procyanidins (PC) as a antithrombotic agent and its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>48 male SD rats were randomized into 6 groups, which include 8 rats each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, group B was model control (no treatment), group C was group treated with aspirin [10mg/(kg x d)], groups D, E and F were treated with low, medial and high dose [100, 200 and 400 mg/(kg x d)] of PC respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In accordance with Kurz's protocols, rat's model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of common carotid artery was contructed with FeCl(3), but for goup A 0.9% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was used for 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2)), 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1alpha</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 contents in plasma were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, the contents of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) and <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 in plasma markedly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of PC groups and aspirin group, and the contents of 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1alpha</z:chebi> in plasma decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the model group, the contents of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) and <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 in plasma markedly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of PC groups and aspirin group, and the contents of 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1alpha</z:chebi> in plasma increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the aspirin group, the contents of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) and <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 in plasma reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of PC groups and the contents of 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1alpha</z:chebi> in plasma increased which was obvious in PC 400 mg/(kg x d) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that PC shows obvious anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> effect, its mechanism closely correlates with inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation as well as protecting vasoendothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antithrombosis of PC shows significant dose-dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of the PC 400 mg/(kg x d) surpass the aspirin, but there is no significant difference between the PC 200 mg/(kg x d) and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study provides experimental basis for clinical prevention and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
