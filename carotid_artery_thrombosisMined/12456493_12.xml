<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously observed that adenovirus-mediated expression of C-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CNP) markedly inhibits neointima formation after balloon injury in rat carotid arteries, suggesting that CNP has multiple effects over its modest inhibitory effect on cellular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that local expression of CNP might have antithrombotic and antiinflammatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Balloon-injured rabbit carotid arteries were infected with an adenovirus expressing human CNP (AdCNP), human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (AdTFPI), or <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> beta-galactosidase (AdLacZ) or infused with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, shear stress-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was evaluated by cyclic flow variation (CFV), reflecting recurrent cycles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and dislodgment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CFV was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AdLacZ-infected and saline-infused arteries but not in arteries infected with AdCNP or AdTFPI even in the presence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injury increased the expressions of intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and infiltration of macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these effects were markedly reduced in AdCNP-treated arteries but not in AdTFPI-infected ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In AdCNP-infected arteries, injury-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was enhanced, leading to increased NO generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when the enhanced NO production was inhibited, neither inhibitory effect was observed, and suppression of neointima formation by CNP was canceled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that overexpression of CNP shows antithrombotic and antiinflammatory effects and reduces neointima formation mainly through enhanced NO production </plain></SENT>
