<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine hundred microspheres (48 microm in diameter) were injected into the right hemisphere, and immunochemical and immunohistochemical studies on the hippocampus were performed on the seventh day thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining showed progressive and severe degeneration of the hippocampus after ME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 43-kDa growth-associated protein (GAP-43), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> protein L1 (L1) in the ipsilateral hippocampus of the ME animal, determined by Western blot analysis or enzyme immunoassay, were increased, unaltered, and decreased, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the immunohistochemical study showed increases in a marker of axonal sprouting GAP-43, and a neurotrophic factor BDNF, and a decrease in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule L1 in some areas of the hippocampal ischemic penumbra of such animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that some factors for regeneration of the neuronal network in the ischemic penumbra responded to sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for a certain period, although functional network of the nerve cells in the microsphere-injected hemisphere would be unlikely established after ME </plain></SENT>
