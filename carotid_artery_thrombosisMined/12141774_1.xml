<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are located most commonly in the maxillary sinus but may be life-threatening when found in the sphenoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We review our series offour sphenoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333040" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungus balls</z:e> with skull base <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our average patient age was 68.7 years old (56-86 years) with three women and one man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDD|jodm|iddm">insulin-dependent diabetic</z:e>, the other three patients were otherwise healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and dizziness with relatively few sinus-specific complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in two of the four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography scans revealed thickened osteitic bone in three cases and two of the four computed tomography scans showed microcalcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> over the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, one patient internal carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> of the planum sphenoidale, and a third patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> to the brainstem inferior to the sella turcica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients had magnetic resonance imaging that revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two magnetic resonance images showed hypointense T1 and T2 imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The third was isointense on T1 and hypointense on T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with endoscopic marsupialization and removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gross fungal debris without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pathological specimens were diagnostic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333040" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungus balls</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One offour cultures was positive for fungus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients are asymptomatic at time of lastfollow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sphenoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333040" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungus balls</z:e> present with vague, non-rhinological symptoms, but may have significant local expansion and destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These potentially lethal lesions usually can be suspected on preoperative imaging and are best treated with endoscopic removal </plain></SENT>
