<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We present a novel, previously undescribed technique of obtaining a biopsy from an inaccessible parapharyngeal space mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A modified endo-cavitary ultrasound probe was utilised to obtain an intra-oral, image-guided core biopsy of a parapharyngeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parapharyngeal mass was not accessible to percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy due to its anatomical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first such modification of the conventional endo-cavitary probe technique described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technique permits accurate, well controlled biopsy of lesions located high in the parapharyngeal space, under general anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
