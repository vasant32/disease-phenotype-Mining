<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 14 New Zealand white rabbits carotid arterial transplants were fashioned into U-shaped loops by microvascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rabbits were sacrificed from 4 to 226 days post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tears in the internal elastic lamina occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loops from 5 days post-operatively and were predominantly transverse and localised about the greater curvature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bends</z:e> of each loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Though initially denuded, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tears appeared endothelialised after 6 days, coalescing later as they increased in size and extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In older animals only islands of wrinkled internal elastic lamina remained at those sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells in the tears were small, numerous and polyhedral with raised nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesser curvature of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bends</z:e> in the loops displayed some irregular wrinkling of the internal elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the three oldest animals a few longitudinal tears were observed on the lesser curvature of the main bend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specific localization of intimal tears supports the concept that they were hemodynamically induced </plain></SENT>
