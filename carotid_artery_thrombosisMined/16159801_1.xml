<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endovascular aortic repairs have been developed as less invasive treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some aneurismal cavities, however, remain without organization, causing a re-expansion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied cell transplantation into the aneurismal sac to promote the organization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> for the complete healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Skin fibroblasts and skeletal myoblasts were isolated from rats for cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An intraarterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> model was made by ligation of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Culture medium (medium group, n=11), collagen gel (gel group, n=11), fibroblasts with collagen gel (F group, n=15), myoblasts with collagen gel (M group, n=12), or mixture of fibroblasts and myoblasts with collagen gel (F+M group, n=14) were injected into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 28 days, histologically, the arterial lumens of the F and M groups were partly filled with fibrous tissues, whereas in the F+M group organization was almost completed and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> sizes diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells were more abundantly contained in the organized area of the F+M group than in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed cellular function in vitro with immunofluorescence; coculture of fibroblasts and myoblasts showed that the fraction of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive fibroblasts increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon accounts for the rapid organization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the F+M group in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cell transplantation accelerated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Especially, myoblasts enhanced differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, contributing to rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cell transplantation into unorganized spaces seems applicable to endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
