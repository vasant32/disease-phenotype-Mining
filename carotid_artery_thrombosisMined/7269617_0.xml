<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>On account of feared postoperative deterioration of the neurological condition and the high mortality, the indication for surgical therapy of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of extracranial origin is often questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate lies between 6.5% and 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with the spontaneous healing process of the apoplectic insult by means of conservative therapy this demonstrates on average a smaller early mortality with a simultaneous higher remission rate of the neurological findings of maximally 70% compared with 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>90% of the predominantly arteriosclerotic carotid occlusions occur in the bifurcation area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>40% of the cases undergo additional stenosis or occlusion of the remaining arteries of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the knowledge of the pathogenesis and the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> on the remaining arteries of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the knowledge of the pathogenesis and the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> on the one hand, and the periodic relationship of carotid occlusion and incipient <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on the other hand, the 6-hour limit is considered of great significance for operational success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The condition of angiographically-visible intracerebral collateralization and the strict elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with unconsciousness or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> set forth further important criteria which must be fulfilled before operative procedures are contemplated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The performance of cerebral panangiography gives additional information about stenosis or occlusion of the other arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indications for operation of extracerebral carotid occlusion must be determined individually on the basis of the above-mentioned guidelines </plain></SENT>
