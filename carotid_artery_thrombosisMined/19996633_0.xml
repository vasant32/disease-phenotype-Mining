<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have shown that some fruits and vegetables have antithrombotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As rice is a principal ingredient of everyday food in Japan, the aim of the present study was to determine rice varieties with antithrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western-style high-fat diet containing flour prepared from whole-grain rice of different varieties was fed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-prone (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E- and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor-deficient) mice for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A laser-induced carotid-artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the five tested rice varieties showed an antithrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of HYJA-Ri1, HYJA-Ri2, HYJA-Ri3 and HYJA-Ri5 rice on experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation did not differ significantly from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, HYJA-Ri4 rice significantly enhanced the thrombotic reaction (p = 0.0078), thus having a prothrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that HYJA-Ri4 rice should not be included in an antithrombotic diet </plain></SENT>
