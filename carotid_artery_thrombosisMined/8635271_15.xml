<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the effects of a monoclonal antibody against TF (AP-1) on lysis time induced by tissue-type plasminogen activator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) and on reocclusion rate in a rabbit model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was obtained by placing an external constrictor around carotid arteries with endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid blood flow velocity ws measured continuously with a Doppler flow probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, the rabbits received either AP-1 (0.15 mg/kg IV, n=8) or placebo (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rabbits also received <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (80 microg/kg bolus plus 8 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) infusion for up to 90 minutes or until reperfusion was achieved) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (200 U/kg IV as a bolus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At reperfusion, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> was discontinued, and the rabbits were followed for an additional 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AP-1 shortened lysis time from 44+/-8 minutes (mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) in control rabbits to 26+/-7 minutes in AP-1 rabbits (P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reocclusion occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control rabbits in 10+/-3 minutes, whereas it occurred in only two of eight AP-1 treated rabbits in 72 and 55 minutes (P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No changes in prothrombin time and ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to various <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> were observed after AP-1 administration, indicating the absence of systemic effects by this antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TF exposure and activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway play an important role in prolonging lysis time and mediating reocclusion after thrombolysis in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AP-1, a monoclonal antibody against TF, might be suitable as adjunctive therapy to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
