<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effects of different extracts from Semen Persicae on clotting time in mice, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in mice and electro-irritate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in rats were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">Ethyl acetate</z:chebi> extract from Semen Persicae could prolong clotting time in mice, markedly relieve respiratory difficult due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in mice induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-Na, obviously retard the generation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induced by electrical injury of carotid artery in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">Ethyl acetate</z:chebi> extract from Semen Persicae possesses evidently anti-thrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
