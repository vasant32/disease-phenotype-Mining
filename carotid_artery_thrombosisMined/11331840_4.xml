<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A recent overview indicated that although routine patching is safer than routine primary closure after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), there is no systematic evidence that patch type influences outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most surgeons still believe that prosthetic patches are probably more thrombogenic than vein patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypothesis that there was no difference in thrombogenicity between the different patch types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 274 patients undergoing 276 CEAs were randomized to either Dacron-patch closure (n = 137) or vein-patch closure (n = 139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with an accessible cranial window were monitored for 3 hours postoperatively with transcranial Doppler scanning (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of emboli and rate of embolization were quantified with the requirement for selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> therapy to control high rates of postoperative embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were assessed postoperatively and again at 30 days by a neurologist, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent a duplex examination at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 2.2% for patients in the Dacron-patch group and 3.6% for patients in the vein-patch group (P =.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the Dacron-patch group had a higher incidence of postoperative emboli (median, 5; interquartile range, 0-10.5) than patients in the vein-patch group (median, 3; interquartile range, 1-17; P =.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of detecting more than 50 emboli was virtually identical, and patch type had no effect on the incidence of high-rate, sustained embolization that required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> therapy (5.3% for Dacron, 3.7% for vein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient had a carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sustained, high-rate embolization, previously shown to be highly predictive of progression to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, appears to be patient dependent, rather than related to patch type </plain></SENT>
