<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this series of 17 patients with blunt trauma of the carotid, three had no symptoms, ten patients had limb <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> and four had severe neuroligic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The wounds were identified by arteriography; repair was attempted in 15 patients, and successful in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients with successful repair were improved or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after surgery, but only two out of nine patients without repair improved, and four died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate for the series was 23%, but only 14% in the patients who had carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This experience suggests that repair is safe and effective in patients with carotid injuries in whom prograde flow continues and only mild neurologic deficits are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with complete occlusion, severe neurologic problems, and altered consciousness are not likely to be helped by attempts at revascularization </plain></SENT>
