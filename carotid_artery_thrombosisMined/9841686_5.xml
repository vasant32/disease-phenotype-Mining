<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If CT scans demonstrated ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, arteriography to visualize supraaortic vessels was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid artery dissection</z:e> was observed in ten patients (0.91%) and was bilateral in eight patients (0.73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> (BCAD) group, there were five women and three men, with a mean age of 35.2 years (range: 17 to 54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injuries resulted from traffic accidents in seven patients and a fall in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon admission, six patients presented with alteration of consciousness and three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or hemiparesia, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two other cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> occurred 24 hr and 13 days after the accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, which was unilateral in five cases and bilateral in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severity of lesions was graded on the basis of arteriographic findings as follows: Type I, wall involvement without significant stenosis or dilation; Type II, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> with stenosis &gt;70% (Type IIA) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> &gt;50% (Type IIB) and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter of the proximal or distal internal carotid artery; and Type III, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lesions were asymmetrical in six patients, including two with Type II and III lesions and four with Type I and II lesions, and symmetrical in two patients, including one with bilateral Type III lesions and one with bilateral Type II lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed in two patients with Type II lesions, including one case associated with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intrapetrous carotid artery was exposed by an ear-nose-throat (ENT) surgeon and repaired by interposition grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up in these two surgical cases was 28 and 31 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the remaining six cases, medical treatment was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Outcome in nonsurgical cases was variable: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in two cases at 31 and 43 days after the accident, severe permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> in two cases, and minimal or no sequels in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Following blunt trauma, arteriography of supraaortic vessels should be performed to detect BCAD in any patient with immediate or delayed neurologic symptoms that cannot be explained by CT-scan findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To better understand the natural course of these lesions and define the indications for surgery, we propose a three-grade classification according to arteriographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>If surgery is undertaken, vein grafting should be performed following resection of the carotid artery lesions </plain></SENT>
