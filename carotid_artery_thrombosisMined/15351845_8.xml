<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TFPI is expressed by both endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the vasculature and circulates at low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of local vascular TFPI in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To establish an experimental animal model to directly modulate smooth muscle cell-derived TFPI on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, transgenic mice in which a cDNA encoding murine TFPI is expressed from the murine SM22alpha promoter were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of transgenic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was 4-fold higher than the level of endogenous TFPI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in arteries from transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization confirmed that expression of the transgene was limited to medial vascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular TFPI activity was increased to 2 to 3-fold in carotid homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in plasma TFPI levels or hemostatic measures (PT, aPTT and tail vein <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times) between these mice and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-induced model of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, homozygotic transgenic mice demonstrated resistance to thrombotic occlusion compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In transgenic mice 22% occluded within 30 minutes of application while 84% of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice occluded within the same time frame (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Heterozygotic transgenic mice had an intermediate thrombotic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicated that local VSMC-specific TFPI overexpression attenuated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without systemic or hemostatic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this transgenic mouse model should prove useful for studying the role of TFPI in the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
