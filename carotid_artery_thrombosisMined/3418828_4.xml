<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the usefulness of computed electroencephalographic (EEG) topographic (<z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi>) brain mapping to monitor neurologic function during carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 46 consecutive patients having CEA were monitored preoperatively, intraoperatively, and immediately postoperatively by <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping and simultaneous 16-lead EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative studies revealed that 7 of 16 asymptomatic patients, 5 of 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, and 8 of 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) had abnormal <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping suggestive of previous subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EEG was abnormal in only 8 of the 20 patients with abnormal <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively during carotid cross-clamping, ischemic changes were seen on <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping in 23 patients whereas EEG detected these changes in only 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic changes detected by intraoperative <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping were more likely to occur in patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (six of seven) than in patients without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (17 of 39), p less than 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with changes detected by intraoperative <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping had an average carotid back-pressure of 38 mm Hg, in contrast to 57 mm Hg for patients without <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping changes, p less than 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After endarterectomy, <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping revealed new ischemic changes in one patient who awoke with a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in one patient who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> within 6 hours of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> brain mapping is a sensitive, accurate, and useful noninvasive monitor of cerebral circulation and function for patients having CEA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
