<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Little is known about whether recanalization of carotid territory occlusions by local intra-arterial thrombolysis (LIT) depends on the type of the occluding thromboembolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analysed the records of 62 patients with thromboembolic occlusions of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation or the middle cerebral artery who were undergoing LIT with urokinase within 6 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the influence of thromboembolus type (according to the TOAST criteria), thromboembolus location, leptomeningeal collaterals, time interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of thrombolysis, and patient's age on recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The thromboembolus type was atherosclerotic in six patients, cardioembolic in 29, of other determined etiology in four, and of undetermined etiology in 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three (53%) thromboembolic occlusions were recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thromboembolus location but not the TOAST <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type nor other parameters affected recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the TOAST group of patients with cardioembolic occlusions recanalization occurred significantly less frequently when transoesophageal echocardiography showed cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study underlines the thromboembolus location as being the most important parameter affecting recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fact that thromboembolic occlusions originating from cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> had a lower likelihood of being resolved by thrombolysis indicates the thromboembolus type as another parameter affecting recanalization </plain></SENT>
