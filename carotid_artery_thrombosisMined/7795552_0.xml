<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgery for carotid disobstruction aims to take out emboligenic plaques by endarterectomy (associated to angioplasty or not) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The adversaries of surgical treatment sustain two main assertions: 1. carotid stenoses are not very dangerous, because the definitive thromboses they create are easily compensated by the development of collaterals, so that the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2. this low and late risk of spontaneous carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is not greater than the immediate one following carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those objections have been encountered in randomized North American studies (Nascet &amp; Veterans) that have been published in 1991 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They show the usefulness of correctly done surgical correction as well as for symptomatic as asymptomatic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>So do we it, presenting the results of our series (2.282 procedures in 1.868 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of our series show a low combined morbidity-mortality rate (1.7%), and a yearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of 1.4% </plain></SENT>
