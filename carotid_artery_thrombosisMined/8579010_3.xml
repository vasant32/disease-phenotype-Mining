<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether sustained, local delivery of hirulog, a potent antithrombin agent, inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and neointimal thickening after arterial stenting, <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> polymers containing hirulog were formulated at a concentration of 5.8% by weight and were tested in vitro to determine the rate of drug release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An oversized metallic stent was implanted in the carotid artery of 18 juvenile farm pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hirulog-impregnated <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> polymers were placed around the adventitial surface of one stented segment of each animal and a control polymer was placed contralaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous hirulog (4 mg/kg/hr) was infused for the duration of the procedure to maintain the activated clotting time of &gt; 300 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo testing estimated the release of hirulog to be 1.54 micrograms/mg matrix/day with no loss of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of the released <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four pigs killed on days 3 through 5, macroscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was very faintly visible on the stent struts of one arterial segment treated with sustained-release hirulog but was readily evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, electron microscopy showed platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation on each stent of both treated and untreated sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen pigs were killed 32 +/- 4 days after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic analysis showed no difference between hirulog-treated and control sides in the volume of neointima (540 +/- 129 units vs 357 +/- 95 units, p = 0.27) or in the average intima to media ratio (0.44 +/- 0.12 vs 0.34 +/- 0.24, p = 0.47) over the length of the stented segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late thrombotic occlusion occurred in two hirulog-treated and two control arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this model, local adventitial hirulog delivery at the dose and delivery rate used may reduce, but does not prevent, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and does not reduce the severity of neointimal thickening after carotid stent implantation </plain></SENT>
