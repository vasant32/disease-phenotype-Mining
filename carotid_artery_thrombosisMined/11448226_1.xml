<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the compounds, 2-[(3S)-4-[2-[(4-guanidinobenzoyl)amino]<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>]-3-[3-[(4-guanidinobenzoyl)amino]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>]-2-oxopiperazinyl]<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (12c) showed a potent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation and good dissociation between the efficacy and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of compound 12c at 1.6 microg/mL/min completely prevented arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation induced by endothelial injury in guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose of 12c that prolonged the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time to three times the control value was 5.8 microg/mL/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that compound 12c might be useful in the clinical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e>, and we selected 12c (TAK-024) as a candidate for the clinical trials </plain></SENT>
