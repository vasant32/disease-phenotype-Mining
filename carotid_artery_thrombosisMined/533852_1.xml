<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ultrasonic doppler flow signals of the ophthalmic collateral flow of 54 carotid occlusions were classified into four types and three degrees--high, moderate, and low reversed flow patterns--and were compared with the angiographic findings of the collateral flow classified into three grades--good, poor, and none </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the exception of three cases, the ultrasonic doppler flow patterns of the collateral flow correlated well with the angiographic findings in 54 occluded carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
