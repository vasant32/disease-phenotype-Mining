<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This is believed to be the first reported case of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after elective maxillary or mandibular osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most likely cause was a sudden, sharp blow to the right carotid artery region either when the mandibular split was completed or when the maxillary tuberosity was separated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blow was associated with neck hyperextension and some lateral flexion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a patient with tight, underdeveloped soft tissue, the resultant intimal tear caused <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this event is associated with a 40% mortality and further 52% serious morbidity, our patient has regained nearly full neurological function--probably thanks to a competent circle of Willis that allowed adequate collateral flow to the brain </plain></SENT>
