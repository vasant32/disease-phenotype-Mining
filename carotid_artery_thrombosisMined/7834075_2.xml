<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> formation of atherosclerotic plaques in human carotid arteries, autopsy investigations were performed on eight patients who had died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to recent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven control patients who had carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological changes of the arteries in serial sections were reconstructed three-dimensionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each artery with occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found to have an intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> at the head of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> on the proximal slope near the base of the thickened atheromatous plaque at the carotid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> formed obliquely or longitudinally, were parallel to the vessel axis, had a fusiform shape, and measured 7 +/- 2 x 3 +/- 1 mm (mean +/- s.d.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> arose by marginal separation of the innermost layer from the underlying layer of the stratified intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An underlying atheroma developed along the borders of these intimal layers reaching the subendothelium, with thinning of the intimal cap to less than 150 microns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The process of ulceration may be generated by vessel injury induced by hemodynamic forces, such as tensile forces and shear stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> may extend along the fragile region where the wall may exhibit uneven compliance due to differences in the tissue structures of each intimal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, macrophages may play a key role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
