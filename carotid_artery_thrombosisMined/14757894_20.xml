<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICAD) is due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> or impaired hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in ICAD by examining brain imaging and cerebrovascular findings of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the prospectively collected brain CT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, and ultrasound findings of 141 consecutive patients with 143 ICADs causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were not included because they had an inappropriate temporal bone window (n=6) or were treated with thrombolysis (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the data of 130 patients (76 men, 54 women) with 131 ICADs were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; 6 patients (5%) also had border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affected the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in 130 of 131 cases (99%) and the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 1 case (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional vascular territories were affected in 8 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (ACA, n=5 [4%]; posterior cerebral artery, n=3 [2%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern (hemodynamic versus thromboembolic) and extent of infarction were not influenced by vascular findings (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis or occlusion, ACA occlusion, degree of obstruction in the dissected ICA, pattern of cross-flow in 115 patients with &gt;80% ICA stenosis or occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, not hemodynamic infarction, is the essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism in ICAD </plain></SENT>
