<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the ability of continuous wave Doppler (CWD), B-mode ultrasound (BMU), angioscopy and transcranial Doppler (TCD) to detect technical error during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective, comparative study in 100 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: Intraoperative TCD monitoring was performed using a SciMed PcDop 842 2 MHz TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An Olympus 2.8mm flexible angioscope was used to inspect the arterial lumen prior to restoration of bloodflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After restoration of flow 10Mhz BMU images and 8Mhz CWD velocity spectra of carotid artery blood flow were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CHIEF OUTCOME MEASURES: The detection of intimal flaps, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, stenoses or other errors of surgical technique likely to result in perioperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: CWD and BMU images were technically inadequate in 9% and 24% of cases respectively and neither technique altered clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angioscopy demonstrated significant technical errors in 12 cases (four intimal flaps, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in eight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD detected shunt malfunction in 13% of patients, emboli during dissection in 23% and early postoperative carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combination of TCD monitoring and completion angioscopy provided the maximum yield in terms of diagnosing technical error and establishing the cause of perioperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
