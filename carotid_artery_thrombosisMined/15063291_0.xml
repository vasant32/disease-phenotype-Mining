<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the right carotid artery was totally obstructed, cerebral perfusion was first restored by cannulating it and the left femoral artery before midline sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a long fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was found flowing backward from the obstructed carotid artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the subsequent aortic procedure, both arteries were used for arterial inflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> can cause grave postoperative neurologic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
