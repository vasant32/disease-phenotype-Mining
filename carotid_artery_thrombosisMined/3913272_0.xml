<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 132 carotid arteries the results of these two examinations have been assessed independently and compared with findings by conventional arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 39 stenoses causing a diameter reduction of more than 25% were found by Doppler examination and 36 (92%) by IVDSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve occlusions of the internal carotid artery, shown by conventional arteriography, were also detected by Doppler examination and 11 (92%) by IVDSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both Doppler and IVDSA detected 56% of the lesions which reduced the diameter by less than 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 54 arteriographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessels were assessed correctly by Doppler examination and 53 (98%) of them by IVDSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study shows that Doppler and IVDSA are well suited for assessing patients with symptoms suggestive of carotid occlusive disease, both methods being accurate in the detection of lesions which reduce the diameter of the carotid artery by more than 25% </plain></SENT>
