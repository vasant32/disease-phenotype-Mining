<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the effects of human recombinant active site-blocked activated factor VII (rFVIIai) in a rabbit model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclic flow variations (CFVs), due to recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, were obtained in stenotic rabbit carotid arteries with endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 30 min of CFV, the animals received rFVIIai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If CFVs were abolished, animals were observed for 30 additional minutes, after which human recombinant activated factor VII was infused into the carotid artery to determine whether it could displace rFVIIai from tissue factor (TF), thus restoring CFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional group of animals received rFVIIai to determine its duration of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant FVIIai abolished CFVs in 8 of 9 rabbits (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was reversible, as rFVIIa administration restored CFVs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further study was initiated to assess whether TF-dependent reductions in coronary blood flow might contribute to the occurrence of myocardial injury during postischaemic reperfusion of rabbit hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recombinant FVIIai resulted in significant reductions in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and no-reflow area, while rFVIIa produced a significant increase in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and no-reflow area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that rFVIIai might be beneficial in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> undergoing reperfusion therapies </plain></SENT>
