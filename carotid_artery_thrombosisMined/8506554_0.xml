<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The two objectives of this study were to assess the potential of BAY U 3405 to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in response to vessel wall injury and to determine the ability of BAY U 3405 to prevent thrombotic reocclusion after thrombolysis with anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dogs were instrumented with a carotid flow probe, stimulating electrode, and a stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current (150 microA) was applied to the intimal surface of the right carotid artery, and time to occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAY U 3405 was administered, and the procedure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was repeated for the left carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BAY U 3405 administration prevented occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo platelet aggregation was inhibited, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time increased, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight reduced after BAY U 3405 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were formed initially in both carotid arteries, BAY U 3405 was administered as before, and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex was infused in the right carotid artery proximal to the occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BAY U 3405 did not alter the incidence of rethrombosis compared with the lytic agent alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BAY U 3405 prevented primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, corresponding to inhibition of platelet aggregation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>increased bleeding times</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BAY U 3405, however, did not prevent rethrombosis after successful thrombolysis with anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, despite the fact that platelet reactivity was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data are consistent with the concept that the residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> represents a more effective thrombogenic stimulus as compared with arterial wall injury alone and that the mechanisms associated with primary versus secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation may require separate therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
