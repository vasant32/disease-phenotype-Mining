<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study we compared duplex-ultrasound characteristics of symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses with cranial computerized tomographic (CCT) findings in 82 patients suffering from completed or transient middle cerebral artery symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to assess the pathogenic role of ICA plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the potential embolic risk of ICA plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was estimated by spectral analysis of the pulsed Doppler signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CCT findings were classified as being either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, lacunar lesions, hemodynamically induced low-perfusion infarctions, or territorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to their ultrasonic features we characterized the ICA plaque surface as smooth or irregular and their structure as homogeneous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plaques with an irregular surface and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> echogenicity dominated significantly in CCT-territorial infarctions (p &lt; 0.01), whereas hemodynamically induced low-perfusion infarctions showed no relationship with any plaque characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High degree ICA stenoses (&gt; 50%) dominated in both territorial infarctions and low-perfusion infarctions, as compared to ipsilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CCT or lacunes (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> CCT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> were associated with homogeneous and smooth plaques (both p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that &gt; 50% ICA stenoses can cause both hemodynamically induced low-perfusion infarctions as well as thromboembolic territorial infarctions, whereas ulcerated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> plaques constitute a high risk factor for arterio-arterial embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, carotid ultrasound may help to estimate the clinical significance of carotid lesions </plain></SENT>
