<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="183" ids="50247">Antidote</z:chebi> control is the safest way to regulate drug activity, because unlike rapidly clearing drugs, control of the drug activity is independent of underlying patient <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and co-morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until recently, however, there was no general method to discover <z:chebi fb="183" ids="50247">antidote</z:chebi>-controlled drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that the activity and side effects of a specific class of drugs, called aptamers, can be controlled by matched <z:chebi fb="183" ids="50247">antidotes</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug, an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> aptamer, systemically induces anticoagulation in pigs and inhibits <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in murine models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="183" ids="50247">antidote</z:chebi> rapidly reverses anticoagulation engendered by the drug, and prevents drug-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in surgically challenged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that rationally designed drug-<z:chebi fb="183" ids="50247">antidote</z:chebi> pairs can be generated to provide control over drug activities in animals </plain></SENT>
