<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence of carotid reoperation and to document operative findings and clinical results, the records of patients requiring early reoperation (after less than 24 hours) during a 10-year period were analyzed with respect to operative findings, clinical outcome, and arterial patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endarterectomy was performed in 920 patients, with 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (3%) and 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early re-exploration was required for 27 patients (3%) for either expanding <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (6 patients) or suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with a new neurologic deficit (21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients bled from the arteriotomy and 4 bled from surrounding tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exploration for new postoperative neurologic events confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 19 cases (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients with patent arteries and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> operative arteriograms were felt to have distal embolization, and the arteriotomy was not opened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were intimal flap in 6 patients and closure stenosis in 11; the cause was unknown in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> arteries were repaired over a shunt with a patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies were available for 16 arteries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which remained patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of patients explored for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, there was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>), no neurologic events, and no late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 21 patients who underwent a second operation for neurologic deficits, 2 died, 8 were unchanged, 2 had minor residual deficit, and 9 had completely resolved deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe contralateral disease was more common among patients with residual deficits (10 of 12) compared with patients without residual deficits (0 of 9; chi-square = 8.23, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Carotid re-exploration is most commonly undertaken for a new neurologic deficit, usually associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at the operative site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> is more often due to arterial narrowing than to an intimal defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prompt repair will restore patency and result in improvement in 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Neurologic recovery is related to the status of the contralateral artery </plain></SENT>
