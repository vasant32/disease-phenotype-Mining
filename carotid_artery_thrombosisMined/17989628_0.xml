<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data obtained from ongoing vascular registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of 2216 consecutive CEAs performed in a single surgical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: New neurological deficits developed in 53 patients (2.4%) following CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients sustained intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 33 patients with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nine patients had mild neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 24 patients with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, five experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> unrelated to operated artery, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> following control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from CEA patch disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 15 patients developed a significant neurological deficit following CEA and underwent re-exploration for postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients had minimal neurological improvement, five patients showed moderate recovery, and the remaining five patients had near complete recovery.Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prompt re-exploration for post CEA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can result in satisfactory outcome in majority of patients </plain></SENT>
