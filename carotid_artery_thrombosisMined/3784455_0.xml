<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This lecture is concerned mainly with questions about how haemodynamic conditions in atherosclerotic arteries affect arriving platelets that aggregate there and about the chemical agents responsible for making the platelets reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of haemodynamic conditions and the agents are known mainly from in vitro experiments in which aggregation can be quantitatively correlated with blood flow and biochemical effects by simple and reproducible methods; the relevance to the more complicated situations in haemostatis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to devise quantitative in vivo methods, mainly because of the rapidity with which platelets adhere and aggregate in diseased or damaged blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypotheses for explaining in vivo platelet aggregation in biochemical and terms must take the haemodynamic situation into account </plain></SENT>
