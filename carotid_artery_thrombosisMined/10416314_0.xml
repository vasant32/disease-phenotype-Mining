<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is obviously important that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> of the procedure is contained within acceptable limits (&lt; 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1991 and December 1997 a total of 239 CEA were performed in 216 patients (169 males and 47 females, mean age 66.6 +/- 14.2 years; range 43-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was carried out using a precoagulated Dacron patch, except in cases in which the residual diameter of the internal carotid artery was greater than 5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Javid shunt was used selectively if stump pressure &lt; 50 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No major neurological complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reversible focal neurological deficit was reported in 3 cases (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological morbidity</z:e> correlated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306889" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral arterial occlusive disease</z:e> appears to be correlated mainly with technical reasons or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> following clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The extensive use of angioplasty with patch and the selective use of a protective shunt improve the technical success rate of surgery, significantly helping to limit morbidity </plain></SENT>
