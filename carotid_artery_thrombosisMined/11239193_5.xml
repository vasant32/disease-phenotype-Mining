<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> on <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the large extracranial arteries is the main cause of embolization in the distal cerebral circulation and thus is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The assessment of biological characteristics of lesions that are predictive of thrombotic complications might help in stratification of the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but is currently imperfect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the performance of (111)In-platelet scintigraphy with blood pool subtraction, ultrasound-based tissue texture analyses, and transcranial Doppler techniques in their ability to predict the occurrence of superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or the presence of a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> pool in carotid artery plaque specimens removed at the time of carotid endarterectomy in 22 patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of &gt;70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positivity at (111)In-platelet scintigraphy was present in 8 patients and correctly identified the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> superimposed on a complicated plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither tissue texture analysis nor emboli detection by transcranial Doppler, performed in 12 patients, significantly identified plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the techniques used were able to detect the presence of a significant <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> pool inside the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-platelet scintigraphy is an accurate noninvasive diagnostic tool to detect thrombotic complications in carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies should assess its ultimate value in risk stratification, possibly to guide the decision of whether to perform endarterectomy in selected patient categories </plain></SENT>
