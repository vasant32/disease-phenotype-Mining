<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) has been reported to prevent platelet activation by inhibiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor binding to platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (GP)Ib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of ATA in vitro and in vivo in hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATA inhibited the in vitro platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, botrocetin and thrombin, but not by collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IC50 values during the ex vivo platelet aggregation by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, botrocetin and thrombin were 8.2 +/- 1.8 microM, 0.9 +/- 0.4 microg/ml and 2.4 +/- 0.8 unit/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The platelet retention time to collagen-coated beads of hamster blood samples was inhibited by ATA (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg per hour) in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous administration of ATA (0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg per h) via an infusion pump produced dose-dependent antithrombotic effects: the time to occlude the carotid artery after vascular injury with a modified catheter was prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only when infused at doses of 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg per hour, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times were significantly prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The continuous treatment with ATA (1.0 mg/kg per h) using a 2ML1 Alzet infusion pump for 2 weeks, resulted in a decrease in neointimal area by 22.2 +/- 6.8% when measured 2 weeks after injury induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA synthesis using DDT1MF2 hamster SMCs was decreased by ATA in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ATA reduced the number of platelets adhering on the injured area, as detected by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that treatment with ATA inhibited platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> but also SMC proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These observations may explain the effect of ATA on neointima formation </plain></SENT>
