<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They stress that reconstructive operations on the extracranial cerebral arteries are primarily of prophylactic importance preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development, they should be carried out in transient brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and imminent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, severe completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are not treated in this way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stenosis of the internal carotid artery lends itself in the first place to this reconstructive operation which should be done possibly early when the artery is not yet completely occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The best time for the operation is 3-4 weeks after development of brain symptoms after abating of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
