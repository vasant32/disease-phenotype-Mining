<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An inhibitor of PAI-1 (TM5275) was newly identified by an extensive study of structure-activity relationship based on a lead compound (TM5007) which was obtained through virtual screening by docking simulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its antithrombotic efficacy and adverse effects were tested in vivo in rats and nonhuman primates (cynomolgus monkey) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TM5275, administered orally in rats (1 to 10 mg/kg), has an antithrombotic effect equivalent to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> (500 mg/kg) in an arterial venous shunt <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model and to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg) in a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-treated carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TM5275 does not modify activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time or platelet activity and does not prolong <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined with tissue plasminogen activator, TM5275 improves the latter's therapeutic efficacy and reduces its adverse effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administered to a monkey model of photochemical induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, TM5275 (10 mg/kg) has the same antithrombotic effect as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg), without enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study documents the antithrombotic benefits of a novel, more powerful, PAI-1 inhibitor in rats and, for the first time, in nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects are obtained without adverse effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
