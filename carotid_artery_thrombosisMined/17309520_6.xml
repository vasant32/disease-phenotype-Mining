<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The KRGE significantly prevented rat carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in vivo in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In line with the above observations, the red ginseng inhibited the U46619-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>-, collagen- and thrombin-induced rabbit platelet aggregations in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 390 +/- 15, 485 +/- 19, 387 +/- 11 and 335 +/- 15 microg/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistently, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> secretion was also inhibited by ginseng in the same pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the red ginseng has a potent antithrombotic effect in vivo, which may be due to the antiplatelet rather than the anticoagulation activity, and the red ginseng intake may be beneficial for individuals with high risks of thrombotic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
