<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From 1980 to 1985, 210 endarterectomies of the carotid artery were performed in 187 patients (50 female, 127 male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 55 cases there were asymptomatic filiform stenoses with concomitant high grade stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>155 stenoses of the carotid artery of mostly the highest degree were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined by means of the direct CW-doppler ultrasound immediately postoperatively and every six months up to six years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases (4.3%) there was a perioperative (central) neurologic incident, which in 5 (2.3%) cases was followed by permanent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of these incidents were caused by an early occlusion of the reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (including perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate) determined by life table analysis for the whole group after 6 years was 5.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s was 4.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of local recurrence (stenosis greater than 50% or occlusions) after six years was 15.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Except for the above mentioned early occlusions only one recurrent stenosis was symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that asymptomatic, non multimorbid patients with doublesided high grade stenoses and symptomatic patients profit from an endarterectomy of the carotid artery, as long as the perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate and mortality do not exceed 3-4% </plain></SENT>
