<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, microarterial <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi>-based (PU) prostheses and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) prostheses were implanted into the carotid artery of the rabbit and were compared with regard to patency and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation at 1 hour (n = 4), 1 day (n = 4), 2 days (n = 4), 1 week (n = 4), 2 weeks (n = 6), 3 weeks (n = 6) and 6 weeks (n = 6) after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial autografts (n = 22), followed up for 2 weeks after implantation, served as a control for the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> arterial autografts were patent at the time of harvesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> microarterial prostheses were patent at 1 hour and some were patent at 1 day, 2 days and 1 week, none of them were patent at 2, 3 and 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patent <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> prostheses showed remarkably less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> accumulation on the graft surface when compared to the patent PU prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prostheses had the same amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation at the distal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
