<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy has demonstrated excellent results over the past 2 decades with combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality of &lt; 4% in most active centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal technique for surgical reconstruction for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative deficits is more controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the last 10 years (1985 to 1995), we performed 1,267 carotid endarterectomies, with 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1.3%) and 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (within 72 hours) postoperative neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients, the carotid artery was confirmed patent by duplex scan or angiography, and the neurologic deficit resolved without further therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early reexploration was performed in 14 cases for suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with a new neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each case, resection of the endarterectomy site and an interposition bypass was performed with greater saphenous vein (11), jugular vein (2), or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (2) grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(One patient required a new bypass for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the initial vein bypass.) Postoperatively, 8 patients had complete resolution of their deficit, 3 had minimal residual deficits, and 3 suffered permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 2 of these patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid artery bypass with exclusion of the endarterectomy site resulted in improvement in symptoms in 79% (11 of 14) of the patients and complete resolution in 57% (8 of 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In long-term follow up (1 to 41 months), there have been no occlusions and one restenosis requiring revision at 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery bypass can be performed safely with acceptable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of autogenous venous conduits allows reconstruction with an endothelial lined conduit that may improve results in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative neurologic deficit secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the endarterectomized carotid artery </plain></SENT>
