<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent presented with a fixed neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deficit was referable to the side of occlusion in 92% and to the side of stenosis in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent had a neurological complication following carotid endarterectomy on the side of the stenotic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological complication was referable to the side of stenosis in 67% and to the side of occlusion in 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients have been followed for an average of 19 months and have not developed any additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the followup period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There may be a role for an extracranial-intracranial bypass (ECIC) on the occluded side prior to an endarterectomy on the stenotic side if a poor collateral situation exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An ECIC should be done in patients who remain symptomatic following carotid endarterectomy on the stenotic side </plain></SENT>
