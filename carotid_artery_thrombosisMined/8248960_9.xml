<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To clarify diagnostic entities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> we analyzed the relation between the severity of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, coagulation parameters, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, neurological status, and risk factors in 232 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography scan, and laboratory investigations were performed between the third and tenth days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on carotid ultrasound scores, we categorized the patients into four groups (A, B, C, and D) according to severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corresponding laboratory variables and clinical data were statistically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultrasound scores were significantly (P &lt; .05) higher in the male (n = 126) versus female (n = 106) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hematocrit was significantly higher and thrombin time was significantly shorter in the male group compared with the female group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (group C) and occlusion (group D) of the internal carotid artery was associated with smoking (C = 56%; D = 78%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (C = 43%; D = 35%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> (C = 13%; D = 5%), and antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (C = 9%; D = 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical correlation between ultrasound scores and the patients' neurological condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol and plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly higher and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was significantly lower in groups with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> compared with patients with slight intimal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple plaques or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal carotid artery was concordant with the prevalence of single cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severity of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> corresponded well with the following factors: age, smoking, and low concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elevation of plasma fibrinogen combined with a loss of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> is strongly associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
