<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the use of CTEA in patients with recent ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 1989 to December 1999 patients who underwent urgent CTEA for recent ICA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient data analyzed included age, sex, comorbid risk factors, diagnostic evaluation, operative procedure, and long-term follow-up with clinical assessment and carotid duplex scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was evaluated with the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) before the operation, immediately after the operation, and at 3- to 6-months' follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent emergency ipsilateral CTEA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> over the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 69.9 +/- 1.7 years, and 66% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient risk factors included <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (7 [24%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (21 [72%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (8 [29%]), and history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040336" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">tobacco abuse</z:e> (20 [69%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (7 [24%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (nonamaurosis) (10 [34%]), crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (7 [24%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in evolution (2 [7%]), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (3 [10%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic evaluation included computed tomographic scan (29 [100%]), magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (4 [14%]), duplex scan evaluation of the carotid arteries (23 [79%]), and cerebral angiography (18 [64%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antegrade flow in the ICA was successfully established in 24 (83%) of 29 patients and confirmed with intraoperative angiography or duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity included 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (7%), 4 transient cranial nerve deficits (14%), and 1 conversion to hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (3.6%), which resulted in the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRS scores averaged 3.4 +/- 0.2 preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Follow-up averaging 74.1 +/- 21 months (range, 3-140 months) was obtained in 27 (93%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Improvement or deterioration was defined as a change in MRS +/- 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Immediately postoperatively, 14 (48%) patients were improved, 2 (7%) deteriorated, and 13 (45%) had no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At 3 to 6 months, 20 (74%) of 27 patients were improved, seven (26%) had no change, and none deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of patients with successful CTEA, 23 (96%) of 24 had a patent ICA on follow-up duplex scan evaluation, and there was no evidence of recurrent ipsilateral neurologic events at an average of 49 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support an aggressive early surgical intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in carefully selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the previous decade we reported a 46% success rate for establishing antegrade flow in the ICA long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Data from this decade show a 79% (P =.0114) success rate for establishing antegrade flow long term in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing emergency CTEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>New and improved imaging modalities have allowed better patient selection, resulting in improved outcomes </plain></SENT>
