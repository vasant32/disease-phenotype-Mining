<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A policy of intra-operative transcranial Doppler (TCD) and completion angioscopy was previously associated with virtual abolition of intra-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (apparent upon recovery from anaesthesia) following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine whether the prevalence of technical error has diminished with experience and whether our monitoring/quality control policy was still associated with low rates of intra-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 20 years after its introduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of four consecutive cohorts of 400 patients undergoing CEA between October 1995 and March 2010 (1600 CEAS in total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred four patients (7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> removed following angioscopy and prior to flow restoration, while 31 (2.1%) underwent repair of a distal intimal flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of intimal flaps diminished from 4.9% in the first 400 patients to 0.8% in the last 400 patients (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the prevalence of retained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> did not decline with experience (8.5%, 3.7%, 10.3% and 5.4% for the four consecutive periods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra-operative TCD and completion angioscopy was, however, associated with extremely low rates of intra-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.25%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 0.25% during the four study periods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most intra-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> probably follow embolisation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> following restoration of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This can be prevented by angioscopy which has the advantage of being performed prior to flow restoration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing experience was associated with a decline in the detection of intimal flaps, but not in the prevalence of retained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even the most experienced of surgeons can still be responsible for inadvertent technical error </plain></SENT>
