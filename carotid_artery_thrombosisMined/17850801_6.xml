<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although remarkable therapeutic advances in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACS) have been made with anti-platelet therapy, the therapeutic options may be limited by considerable side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has anti-oxidative properties and may play a protective role against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether PEDF prevented occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was induced by treating rats with ligation and cuff placement at the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of PEDF dose-dependently inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and blocked the increase in immunoreactivity of P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, PEDF significantly decreased collagen-induced reactive oxygen species generation in platelets and subsequently suppressed the platelet activation and aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma and intraplatelet levels of PEDF in the coronary circulation in patients with ACS were significantly lower than those in age- and gender-matched controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that PEDF administration could inhibit occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation by blocking the platelet activation and aggregation through its anti-oxidative properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our present study suggests that pharmacological up-regulation or substitution of PEDF may offer a promising strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
