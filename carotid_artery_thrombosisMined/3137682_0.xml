<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both nafazatrom (5 mg/kg, i.v.) and molsidomine significantly delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, an activity that was shared by prostacyclin (100 ng/kg/min, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">Acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>, at a dosage devoided of antithrombotic activity (100 mg/kg, i.v.) abolished the effect of nafazatrom but not of molsidomine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a cyclooxygenase-dependent compound (prostacyclin ?) play a major role in the antithrombotic effect of nafazatrom but not of molsidomine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since compounds inhibiting the lipoxygenase pathway, i.e., BW755c (10 and 25 mg/kg, i.v.) and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10 and 25 mg/kg, i.v.) were unable to show any antithrombotic effect, the activity of molsidomine can unlikely be due to its lipoxygenase inhibitory property </plain></SENT>
