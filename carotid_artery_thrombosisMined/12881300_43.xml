<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether ectopically expressed factor VIII in developing megakaryocytes would be stored in alpha-granules and whether its release from circulating platelets would effectively ameliorate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in a factor VIIInull mice model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the proximal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1b alpha promoter to drive expression of a human factor VIII cDNA construct, transgenic lines were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One line had detectable human factor VIII that colocalizes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor in platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These animals had platelet factor VIII levels equivalent to 3% to 9% plasma levels, although there was no concurrent plasma human factor VIII detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When crossed onto a factor VIIInull background, whole blood clotting time was partially corrected, equivalent to a 3% correction level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a cuticular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time study, these animals also had only a partial correction, but in an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> carotid artery, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> assay correction was equivalent to a 50% to 100% level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies show that factor VIII can be expressed and stored in platelet alpha-granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our studies also suggest that platelet-released factor VIII is at least as potent as an equivalent plasma level and perhaps even more potent in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
