<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to develop a new carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model with an arterial shear rate close to that prevailing in affected arteries of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and to test various antithrombotic principles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In anaesthetized guinea pigs, carotid blood flow was monitored by a Doppler flow probe and the vessel was damaged by 2 or 3 brief pinches by a surgical forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intravenous effects of aspirin (20 mg/kg), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (200 U/kg) and hirudin (500 micrograms/kg) or Ro 44-9883 (0.2 to 1 mg/kg), a new selective non-peptidic GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the damage, blood flow progressively decreased to zero and could regularly and reproducibly be restored by a mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> consisted mainly of platelet aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated shear rate in the damaged carotid artery was in the range of 1500 to 2800 s-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resulting cyclic flow variations (CFVs) were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the guinea pigs and were abolished in 10%, 20% and 60% of the animals treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, hirudin and aspirin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ro 44-9883 abolished dose dependently the CFVs with 100% abolition at 1 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus reproducible <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without additional stenosis can be generated in the carotid artery of the guinea pig at a lower shear rate than that prevailing in the classical <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GPIIb-IIIa blockade showed a higher curative efficacy than inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway or that of thrombin generation either through an antithrombin III dependent or independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
