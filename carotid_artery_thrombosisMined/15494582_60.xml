<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of carotid plaque rupture and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, excluding those with possible cardiac embolization or with severe stenosis of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A total of 269 carotid plaques selected from an Interinstitutional Carotid Tissue Bank were studied by histology after surgical endarterectomy between January 1995 and December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 96 plaques were from patients with ipsilateral major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 91 plaques from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), and 82 plaques from patients without symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, cap rupture, cap <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, inflammatory infiltrate, and major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> between study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A thrombotically active carotid plaque associated with high inflammatory infiltrate was observed in 71 (74.0%) of 96 patients with ipsilateral major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 32 plaques from patients operated within 2 months of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) compared with 32 (35.2%) of 91 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (P &lt; .001) or 12 (14.6%) of 82 patients who were without symptoms (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was observed in 53.8% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> operated 13 to 24 months after the cerebrovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was associated with cap rupture in 64 (90.1%) of 71 thrombosed plaques from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and with cap <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> in the remaining 7 cases (9.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ruptured plaques of patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were characterized by the presence of a more severe inflammatory infiltrate, constituted by monocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocyte cells compared with that observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and asymptomatic groups (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between groups in major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a major role of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0577631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid atherosclerotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
