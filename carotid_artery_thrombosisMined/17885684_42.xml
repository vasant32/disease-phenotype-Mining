<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent human and animal data suggest that particulate matter may induce alterations in hemostatic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we determined the mechanisms by which particulate matter might accelerate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that mice treated with a dose of well characterized particulate matter of less than 10 microM in diameter exhibited a shortened <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, decreased prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times (decreased plasma clotting times), increased levels of fibrinogen, and increased activity of factor II, VIII, and X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This prothrombotic tendency was associated with increased generation of intravascular thrombin, an acceleration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, and an increase in bronchoalveolar fluid concentration of the prothrombotic cytokine IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knockout mice lacking IL-6 were protected against particulate matter-induced intravascular thrombin formation and the acceleration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of macrophages by the intratracheal administration of liposomal clodronate attenuated particulate matter-induced IL-6 production and the resultant prothrombotic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that exposure to particulate matter triggers IL-6 production by alveolar macrophages, resulting in reduced clotting times, intravascular thrombin formation, and accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide a potential mechanism linking ambient particulate matter exposure and thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
