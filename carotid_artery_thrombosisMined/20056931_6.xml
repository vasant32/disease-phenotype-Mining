<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the site of arterial obstruction has been shown to influence recanalization and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this has not been studied in randomized controlled trials, nor has the impact of arterial obstruction site on reperfusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the influence of site and degree of arterial obstruction patients enrolled in the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial (EPITHET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EPITHET was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the 3- to 6-hour time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial obstruction site and degree were rated on magnetic resonance angiography blinded to treatment allocation and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 101 EPITHET patients, 87 had adequate quality magnetic resonance angiography, of whom 54 had baseline arterial obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> growth attenuation was greater in those with tPA treatment compared to placebo among patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) obstruction (P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment benefit of tPA over placebo in attenuating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth was greater for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> than internal carotid artery (ICA) obstruction (P=0.060) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With tPA treatment, good clinical outcome was more likely with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> than with ICA obstruction (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients with ICA obstruction did not achieve good clinical outcome, whether treated with tPA (100%) or placebo (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study was underpowered to prove any treatment benefit of tPA among patients with any or severe degree of arterial obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Arterial obstruction site strongly predicts outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ICA obstruction carries a uniformly poor prognosis, whereas good outcomes with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> obstruction are associated with tPA therapy </plain></SENT>
