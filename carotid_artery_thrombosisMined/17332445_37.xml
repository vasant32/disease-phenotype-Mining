<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) generally has a poor prognosis and appears to respond poorly to intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanical thrombectomy is a newly available modality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy, but it is unknown whether this endovascular therapy may have a role in the specific setting of intracranial ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed the success rate of the Merci Retriever mechanical thrombectomy device in recanalization of intracranial ICA occlusions and sought to determine whether ICA recanalization with this therapy can result in better outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from intracranial ICA occlusion were identified in the MERCI and Multi MERCI Part I trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined the success rate of ICA recanalization with endovascular thrombectomy and then assessed clinical outcomes according to whether vessel recanalization was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from intracranial ICA occlusion were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 80 patients, 53% had successful ICA recanalization with the Merci Retriever alone and 63% had ICA recanalization with use of the Merci Retriever plus adjunctive endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline patient characteristics and procedural complications did not differ between the recanalized and nonrecanalized groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Good clinical outcome, defined by a modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 at 90 days, occurred in 39% of patients with ICA recanalization (n=19 of 49) and in 3% of patients without ICA recanalization (n=1 of 30) (P&lt;0.001; one patient was lost to follow up for 90-day modified Rankin Scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ninety-day mortality was 30% (n=15 of 50) in the recanalized group and 73% (n=22 of 30) in the nonrecanalized group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was not significantly different between the recanalized (6% [n=3 of 50]) and nonrecanalized (16.7% [n=5 of 30]) groups (P=0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> rates were also not found to be influenced by use of intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression identified ICA recanalization (OR=28.4, 95% CI=2.6 to &gt;99.9) and lack of history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR=0.15, 95% CI=0.04 to 0.57) as significant predictors of a good 90-day outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Failure to recanalize the ICA (OR=0.16, 95% CI=0.05 to 0.51) and age (per decade, OR=1.07, 95% CI=1.03 to 1.13) were significant predictors of mortality at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial ICA occlusion using the Merci Retriever device, alone or in combination with adjunctive endovascular therapy, has a high rate of successful vessel recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Subjects with successful ICA recanalization by this method have improved poststroke clinical outcome and survival compared with subjects in which the ICA is not successfully recanalized </plain></SENT>
