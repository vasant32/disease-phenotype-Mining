<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : In the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion (ICAs/o) are considered asymptomatic, yet they are prone to mostly subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: : The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) often fails to detect mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive in recognizing such changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : Scores on the MoCA and MMSE were compared in 70 asymptomatic patients with ICAs/o and 70 controls matched for demographic variables and vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : MMSE scores fell mostly within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in both patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences were significant for total MoCA scores (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ICAs/o performed worse on visuospatial and executive function (P=0.018), abstraction (P&lt;0.001), and delayed recall (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower MoCA scores were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio=6.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.277-32.220; P=0.024) and older age (odds ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.780-0.956; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> performed worse on delayed recall (P&lt;0.001), and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were worse on the MoCA naming subtest (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : The MoCA successfully identified reduced cognitive status in patients with ICAs/o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MoCA subtest scores revealed a pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> similar to that documented in other studies using more extensive neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MoCA could be used as part of the clinical evaluation of patients with ICAs/o </plain></SENT>
