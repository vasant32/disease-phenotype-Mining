<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Embolic ischemic events have long been suspected to occur in the cerebral arteries distal to an ipsilateral occluded internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Documentation of microemboli by transcranial Doppler sonography during catheter angiography in patients with ICA occlusions provides objective evidence of such distal emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven patients undergoing carotid angiography were evaluated with transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were also screened for ICA occlusions using carotid duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the seven patients, we saw five right ICA occlusions and two left ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time visual and auditory confirmations of emboli were obtained by recognizing their specific spectral signatures and harmonic qualities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Routes of collateral flow were determined from angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific phases of the examination were correlated with embolic occurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, emboli were seen during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the individual patients, emboli were identified in one to four of the eight angiographic phases we defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most emboli occurred during catheter flushing and contrast injection rather than during wire and catheter manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The emboli were detected in the middle cerebral artery distribution ipsilateral to the occluded ICA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow patterns included, in four patients, external carotid artery-to-ICA collateral flow; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients, patent anterior communicating arteries; and in three patients, patent posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Emboli seen in middle cerebral arteries ipsilateral to occluded ICAs during cerebral angiography strongly indicate that emboli can occur distal to an occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the thought that emboli arising from sources proximal to an occluded ICA may reach the hemisphere distal to the occlusion, resulting in parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or infarction </plain></SENT>
