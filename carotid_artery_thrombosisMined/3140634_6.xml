<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in rabbits that utilizes the Seldinger technique and digital arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid arteries of 14 rabbits were catheterized selectively and embolized with autologous blood clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After embolization, eight rabbits received IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA); the remaining six were infused with saline and served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After embolization, cerebral arteriograms were obtained at 30-min intervals for 180 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteriograms obtained after tPA therapy revealed partial or complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> dissolution in seven (88%) of the eight treated rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group, none of the arteriograms of the embolized internal carotid arteries showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> dissolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the tPA-treated group, the median time for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> dissolution was 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model is economical, reproducible, and less traumatic to the brain than most of the previously described animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also provides a means to compare the safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic agents in small animals </plain></SENT>
