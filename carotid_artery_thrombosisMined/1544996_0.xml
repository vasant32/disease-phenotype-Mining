<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following plaque characteristics were present: intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (73 plaques), ulceration (83 plaques), fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (93 plaques), and recanalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (22 plaques) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An average of 2.4 characteristics were observed in each complicated plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only significant (p less than 0.05) clinico-pathologic correlation was the presence of fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, found in 80% of the plaques from patients with a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, in 93% of those with nonfocal neurologic symptoms, and in 80% of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
