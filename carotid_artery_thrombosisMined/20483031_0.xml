<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To describe the clinical and neuroradiological features of internal watershed (IWS) infarction and to analyze the relationship between IWS infarction and occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of carotid artery</z:e> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 27 IWS infarction patients with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by commonly used templates within 10 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with potential cardiac sources of embolism were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of carotid arteries</z:e> were assessed by magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics, clinical course, prognosis, neuroradiological features and symptomatic arteries were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patterns were identified: 14 patients had confluent IWS (C-IWS) infarction, and 13 patients had partial IWS (P-IWS) infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients in C-IWS group and 10 patients in P-IWS group had severe stenosis (&gt;70%) or occlusion in either the internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occlusive diseases of ICA and non-lacunar syndrome were more prevalent in C-IWS group, while occlusive diseases of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and lacunar syndrome were more prevalent in P-IWS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitant small cortical lesions ipsilateral to IWS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in C-IWS group than in P-IWS group, and were significantly associated with ICA diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical deterioration during the first seven days after admission and poor outcome assessed by the Modified Rankin Score 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were more prevalent in C-IWS group than in P-IWS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a relatively definite relationship between IWS infarction and occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of carotid arteries</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The distribution of symptomatic arteries (ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in C-IWS group is significantly different from that in P-IWS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both hypoperfusion and microembolism are probable mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There may be some differences in their roles in pathogenesis of C-IWS and P-IWS infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Microembolism may contribute C-IWS infarction in addition to hypoperfusion, which is the major pathogenesis of P-IWS infarction </plain></SENT>
