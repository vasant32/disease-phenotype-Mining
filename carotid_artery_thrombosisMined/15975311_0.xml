<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medic (TFA) on the function of platelets and to explore its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat models of artery-veins bypassing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The platelets of rabbits were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was induced by collagen and intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was assayed by Fura-2 method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TFA (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently reduced the weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TFA (0.025, 0.05, 0.1 mg/ml) possessed dose-dependant inhibitory effects on rabbits' platelet aggregation induced by collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TFA significantly reduced the resting and CaCl(2)-induced increase of free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in rabbit platelet in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TFA has an antiplatelet effect via the inhibition on the influx of Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
