<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report eight patients from a 10-year interval who sustained blunt injuries to the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of eight patients suffered a hyperextension injury or had a cervical spine fracture or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arteriography revealed four <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> and four thrombotic occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two asymptomatic common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> and one dissection with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> had successful arterial reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients were treated nonoperatively: three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissections</z:e> with minor or no neurologic deficit; one asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; and one internal carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with a major fixed neurologic deficit that did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient died, and seven of eight made a complete neurologic recovery or remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of blunt carotid artery injuries should be suspected in patients with neck hyperextension injuries or with cervical spine fractures as well as in patients with neurologic deficits not explained by intracranial trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duplex scanning may be a useful noninvasive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgery is indicated for selected patients with accessible lesions who have minor or no neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients with small intimal flaps or dissections may be successfully treated nonoperatively </plain></SENT>
