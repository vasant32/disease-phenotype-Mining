<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which was treated by a saphenous vein graft, is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 49-year-old right handed male was admitted to the hospital because of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These symptoms disappeared spontaneously two weeks after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, visual acuity remained impaired on the left side due to occlusion of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed complete occlusion of the common carotid arteries as well as patency of the internal carotid arteries on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PET and 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT studies showed hypoperfusion in the left cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To restore the blood flow as well as to remove the source of the emboli, endarterectomy was performed on the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was followed by a saphenous vein graft between the left subclavian and the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography revealed patency of the bypass, and a SPECT study revealed increased blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient has remained in stable condition during the following 30 months with no neurological problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in the treatment of complete occlusion of the common carotid artery and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, a bypass graft between the internal carotid and the subclavian artery is quite effective, and that the site of the bypass graft should carefully be sought for by using preoperative angiographic studies </plain></SENT>
