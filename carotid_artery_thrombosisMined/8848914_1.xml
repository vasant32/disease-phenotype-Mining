<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Per- and postoperative neurologic complications occurring during carotid artery surgery may be related to different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that they are related and that patients who develop reversible neurologic events peroperatively are at risk of postoperative neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, studied 265 patients operated under regional anaesthesia to assess the incidence and the pathogenesis of per- and postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> and their relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Neurologic function was adequately assessed in 261 patients during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The operation was uneventful in 234 patients, while 27 suffered from transient ischaemic neurologic deficit occurring mainly during carotid artery clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative neurologic complications occurred in 6 (2.5%) of the patients who were symptom-free during surgery and in 1 (3.7%) of the patients who experienced neurologic deficit during surgery (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group, two additional patients had peroperative neurologic deficit which lasted a few hours postoperatively so that the total incidence of postoperative neurologic deficit (11.1%) was significantly higher than in the other group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Emboli (N = 3) and carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (N = 3) were the main causes of postoperative neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that patients who have suffered from a peroperative neurologic complication were more frequently in an unstable neurologic condition postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of "new" neurologic deficit, separated by a free interval from the one occurring peroperatively, was not significantly different in this group </plain></SENT>
