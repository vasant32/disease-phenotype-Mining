<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Intra-aneurysmal coil embolization has been established as a common method for the intravascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>, but few studies have evaluated its long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because there is no sufficient objective landmark of complete embolization, determination of its application depends on a surgeon's experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A glass <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> model was produced, and the changes in intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nylon thread with a diameter of 0.33 mm, resembling the coils clinically used for embolization, was used to fill in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After perfusion of glycerin solution to represent human blood, the half life of a dye injected into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was optically measured, and the relationship between the half life and the volume embolization rate (VER) of nylon thread in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximal VER obtained by filling nylon thread in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 41.7+/- 2.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The half life of the dye increased with the VER and was significantly increased at VER&gt;30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The half life of the dye in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> reflected stagnation of intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics, suggesting that the prolongation of the half life enhances <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggested that VER&gt;30% is sufficient for effective coil embolization </plain></SENT>
