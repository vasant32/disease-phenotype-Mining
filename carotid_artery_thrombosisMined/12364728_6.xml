<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The correct detection and quantification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> are of decisive impact on patient prognosis and adequate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the ability of ultrasonography to detect and to grade carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> through a comparison of the in vivo ultrasound findings with the planimetric analysis of the corresponding postmortem specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Shortly before their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 59 critically ill neurological patients (mean age, 70 years) were prospectively examined by extracranial and intracranial Doppler sonography and color-coded duplex ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was classified by hemodynamic and morphological ultrasound criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid specimens were removed in toto during autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under standardized conditions, specimens were redistended, sectioned, and histologically processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computerized planimetric measurements of the arteries were carried out and compared with the ultrasound findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation of the ultrasound and postmortem planimetric findings was available in 93 carotid bifurcations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Through both techniques, 46 carotid arteries were found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Steno-occlusive carotid lesions ranged from 8.5% to 100% lumen reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, r=0.96 and adjusted R(2)=0.90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the steno-occlusive carotid lesions, r=0.91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extracranial and intracranial Doppler and color-coded duplex ultrasound permits reliable detection and quantification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> and occlusions even under difficult examination conditions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
