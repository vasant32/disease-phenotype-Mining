<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A histologic method was developed for three-dimensional (3-D) analysis of atherosclerotic plaques removed from the carotid bifurcation during endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By sectioning the plaque at frequent intervals (0.5 to 1.0 mm), it is possible to obtain important information on plaque constituents with regard to their volume and distribution within the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data from each section are combined with those from other sections and displayed in a 3-D format for the entire length of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tissues making up each of the 10 carotid plaques were outlined and digitized for each histologic section by position along the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the areas outlined a 3-D model was created by a computer-aided design program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative information on tissue distribution within the plaque was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrous tissue constituted between 35% and 70% of plaque volume; loose <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> from 0.5% to 30% of the plaque and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occupied, at a maximum, 10% even though if was present in six of the 10 plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To investigate the distribution of constituents about the long axis, measurements were also made from each of the four quadrants of each section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of the measurements of three sets of sections at 10-mm separation showed that estimates of the amount of some constituents were very reproducible whereas others had considerable variation related to the small volume they occupied within the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By generating a complete 3-D reproduction of the contents of atherosclerotic plaques, it may be possible to identify those features of the plaque that are most responsible for the development of ischemic events </plain></SENT>
