<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a 67 male with a symptomatic high grad stenosis of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative completion angiography showed a thrombotic occlusion and the internal carotid artery (ICA) was resected with interposition of a Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Completion angiography then revealed a dissection of the petreous ICA, which was corrected by insertion of a coronary artery stent.Stenting of the ICA is a useful tool to restore cerebral perfusion without time delay and completion imaging is extremely helpful for early detection of dissection during CEA </plain></SENT>
