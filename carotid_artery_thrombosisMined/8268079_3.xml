<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first reported case in the international literature describing the association of posttraumatic innominate artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with total occlusion and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the common carotid artery at its origin by an intimal flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic problems created by this unusual injury are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case the patency of the distal portion of the common and internal carotid arteries was demonstrated by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), whereas color duplex and digital arteriographic studies were unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This demonstration was crucial to patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since no studies are available comparing color duplex imaging, conventional arteriography, and MRA in the evaluation of blunt carotid trauma, this case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of MRA in emergency situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we analyze the possible pathogenesis and discuss the surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
