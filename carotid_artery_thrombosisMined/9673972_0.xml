<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When interpreting CT studies after local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) in the carotid territory, one must consider that a hyperdense lesion may also be caused by extravasation of contrast material during angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we retrospectively analyzed CT scans of 24 patients performed within 24 h after LIF and correlated the results with clinical and angiographic findings before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of 24 patients (12.5%) showed striatocapsular parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, 2 patients died and 1 showed marked clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 24 patients (62.5%) showed hyperdense lesions without space-occupying effect within striatocapsular infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 6 of these patients (25%) these lesions were attributable to an extravasation of contrast medium during angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This extravasation required at least partial recanalization of the middle cerebral artery and always occurred within a striatocapsular infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of extravasation of contrast medium during local intra-arterial fibrinolysis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The identification of these lesions, however, is essential for the assessment of safety of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
