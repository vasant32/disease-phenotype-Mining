<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The radiological parameters employed for the assessment of ulcerations were excavations of the vascular contour, ill defined vessel walls and steep plaque surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall sensitivity of DSA was 66%, specificity 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The depth of excavations proved to be the most accurate sign in detecting ulcerative lesions (sensitivity 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in rare cases mural recesses with the angiographic appearance of ulceration corresponded to re-endothelialized cavities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small intimal disruptions with a depth of 0.1 to 1 mm. could not be detected by intravenous DSA </plain></SENT>
