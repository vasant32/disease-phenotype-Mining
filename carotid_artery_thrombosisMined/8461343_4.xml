<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reliable differentiation between a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, stenosis and occlusion of VA can now be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied two groups of patients in a prospective study with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> (n = 48), and with a combination of carotid and vertebral artery disease (n = 14), to determine the role of VA in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) in the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from the existing arteriosclerotic changes of the internal carotid arteries, the condition of the VA was of importance for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in the vertebrobasilar territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that 8% of the patients with isolated hemodynamically relevant stenosis or occlusion of one or both internal carotid arteries had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in the vertebrobasilar territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with combined carotid and vertebral artery disease had an increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in the same region in 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in this group might be attributed to the combined effect of carotid and vertebral artery disease, as a third group (n = 30) with isolated vertebral artery disease showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in only 13% </plain></SENT>
