<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of combining stent implantation in the parent artery with endosaccular coil placement for the treatment of experimentally created wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were surgically created on the common carotid artery in 12 swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A metal stent was endovascularly implanted across each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck and its effect documented anigiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> remained patent, a microcatheter was introduced into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> through the stent mesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrically detachable coils were delivered into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac to produce <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After stent implantation, one carotid artery thrombosed and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> spontaneously occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other 9 cases, coils were deposited through the stent to occlude the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> packing was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of the stent allowed placement of small coils near the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck, thus contributing to the safe occlusion of small remnants in the final stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> packing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of stent implantation and coil placement is feasible in the treatment of experimental wide-necked saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The stent maintains patency of the parent artery while allowing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion by endosaccular coil placement through the stent's mesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> remnants is possible with no fear of coil hernation or migration into the parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term studies will be necessary before application to treatment of selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
