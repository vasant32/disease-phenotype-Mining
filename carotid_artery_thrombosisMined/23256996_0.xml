<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, solvent group, and MWCNO group, each including 6 ∼ 9 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An inverted fluorescence microscope and a flow chamber were used to observe the effects of 20 g/ml MWCNOs on platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> at shear rates of 500 s(-1) and 1000 s(-1); the experiment was repeated at least three times in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rat model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by 25% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi>, and the effects of 2 mg/kg MWCNOs on the blood flow and wet weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> per millimeter in the model were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When the shear rate was 500 s(-1), the MWCNO group showed a significantly smaller number of adhering platelets than the solvent group (58.3 ± 16.1 platelets/0.01 mm(2) vs 190.1 ± 36.0 platelets/0.01 mm(2)), but the inhibitory effect of MWCNOs on platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> disappeared as the shear rate increased to 1000 s(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The wet weights of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> per millimeter at 0 h after injection of a solvent or MWCNOs via the caudal vein were 0.83 ± 0.12 mg/mm in the solvent group and 0.97 ± 0.11 mg/mm in the MWCNO group, and the wet weights of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> per millimeter at 12 h after injection were 0.89 ± 0.12 mg/mm in the solvent group and 1.01 ± 0.15 mg/mm in the MWCNO group, exhibiting no significant differences between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were also no significant differences between the two groups in terms of blood flow at 0 h and 12 h after injection (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MWCNOs have inhibitory effect on platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in vitro, but the injection of MWCNOs via the caudal vein has no effects on the blood flow and wet weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> per millimeter in experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
