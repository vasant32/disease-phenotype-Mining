<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The presence of collateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) flow via the primary collateral pathway is thought to protect against the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been few reports on early clinical outcomes according to the presence of collateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to investigate the early clinical outcomes and lesion patterns according to the presence of collateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flows in AIS with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with AIS with ICA occlusion consecutively admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center between October 2008 and March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if they were admitted within 12 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> with AIS and symptomatic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow was defined as the presence of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> signals from proximal M1 to distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion by magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early neurological deterioration (END) was defined as a 4-point increase in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score and persistent neurological deterioration for at least 24 h or newly developed neurological symptoms within 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-five patients (42 men, 23 women) were finally included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial NIHSS scores were significantly lower, and favorable outcomes at 3 months were better in patients with collateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow than in those without (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial lesion patterns were different according to the collateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, patients with mild AIS might more frequently deteriorate than those with moderate to severe AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our study, collateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow reduced initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and was associated with favorable outcomes at 3 months but did not seem to protect against END in mild AIS patients with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the results of this study suggest that mild AIS patients with ICA occlusion should be carefully managed because their conditions may deteriorate </plain></SENT>
