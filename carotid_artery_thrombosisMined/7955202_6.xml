<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic agents used clinically rely on the activation of plasminogen to plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasmin possesses multiple actions including increasing thrombin activity and activation of platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, after successful thrombolytic therapy, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and reocclusion may be the result of a predominant plasmin-induced thrombogenic action at the site of the residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrolase, a direct-acting fibrinolytic enzyme from southern copperhead snake venom, induces rapid clot lysis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrolase does not rely on plasminogen activation or any other bloodborne components for activity and is not inhibited by any of the rapidly acting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48353">serine proteinase inhibitors</z:chebi> in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the efficacy of fibrolase to lyse an occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formed in the carotid artery of the anesthetized dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrolytic injury was initiated in both the right and left carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after both arteries were occluded, each vessel was infused with either fibrolase (4 mg/kg over 5 minutes) or physiological saline (over 5 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two separate groups of dogs, anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) (0.1 U/kg) was infused into the occluded vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the artery infused with fibrolase, five of five dogs exhibited patency within 6 +/- 1 minutes of the infusion (P &lt; .05 versus vehicle-treated artery; Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral carotid artery that received vehicle, the occlusion was maintained throughout the experimental protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>APSAC alone lysed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in each vessel within 17 +/- 3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five minutes after the end of fibrolase administration and in one of the groups administered APSAC, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (GP)IIb/IIIa antibody, 7E3 (0.8 mg/kg IV), was administered to prevent reocclusion of the patent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After 7E3 administration, the vessel treated with fibrolase remained patent in four of five dogs, and six of six APSAC-treated vessels were patent for the remainder of the observation period (2 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that local administration of fibrolase lyses a carotid arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> rapidly without excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The enzyme in combination with antiplatelet therapy (7E3) offers a unique mechanism for clot dissolution and may prove useful as a clinically efficacious alternative to presently used thrombolytic agents or may act in a synergistic manner with plasminogen activators </plain></SENT>
