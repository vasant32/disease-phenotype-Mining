<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">Polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) patches have been shown to have comparable results to autogenous vein patching; however, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> has the disadvantage of prolonged hemostasis time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, many surgeons are using collagen-impregnated Dacron patches (Hemashield[HP]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We believe this is the first prospective controlled study of the use of HP in carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study included 144 consecutive patients who had 151 CEAs with HP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative duplex ultrasounds were done at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 12 months (range: 1-30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indications for CEA included symptomatic (64%) and asymptomatic (36%) stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 5% (4% perioperative), with a combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of &gt; or =50% recurrent stenosis was 21% (7% symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and &gt; or =80% recurrent stenosis was 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that at 1 year and 2.5 years freedom from &gt; or =50% recurrent stenosis was 78% and 57%, respectively, freedom from &gt; or =80% recurrent stenosis was 92% and 77%, respectively, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival rate of 94% and 72%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Women had a 22% and men a 14% recurrent stenosis rate (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between other specific risk factors and recurrent stenosis except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (33% vs 12%, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that CEA with HP had a higher incidence of recurrent stenosis (21%), and a higher perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (4%) after a mean follow-up of 12 months than previously reported using <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> or saphenous vein patching (2% and 9% recurrent stenosis rates, respectively, and 1% and 0% perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates, respectively after a mean follow-up of 30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This raises the question as to whether this patch is thrombogenic in this location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a randomized controlled trial comparing this patch with other patches (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> or vein) is warranted </plain></SENT>
