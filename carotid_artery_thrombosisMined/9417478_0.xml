<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgery or endovascular techniques can be used for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current techniques are not well adapted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a wide implantation (or neck) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this experimental work was to study a technique for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which can be used for wide neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A metal stent is implanted facing the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to allow occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first part of the study, the stent was inserted alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were created surgically in five dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stents were positioned facing seven of the ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The stent led to immediate occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in six of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> remained patent despite the correct position of the stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One dog developed secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three dogs have been followed for sixty days after insertion of the stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> thrombosed and one was patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since these results were less than satisfactory, a second part of the study was undertaken to cover the stent with a fragment of the autologous vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results in five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, evaluated three and eight weeks after treatment, showed partial or total repermeabilization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the third part of the study, we associated stents and detachable coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Twelve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the carotid artery in pigs were thrombosed and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were completely occluded after stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the nine other cases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were completely occluded after stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the nine other cases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> remained patent despite the stent and treatment was then completed with a coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Six of the animals have been followed for thirteen weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>One carotid artery thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the five other cases, the carotid arteries were patent and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were occluded at the control angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Histology results showed the presence of a fibromuscular endothelialized neointima at the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in four of the five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The technique described here could be proposed for the treatment of wide-neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> implanted low on the carotid artery in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Improvements should render the system more flexible </plain></SENT>
