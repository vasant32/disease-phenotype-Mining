<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the thrombolytic activity of a novel modified t-PA, YM866, with that of t-PA in a rat model of electrically-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> to be composed mainly of platelet clumps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the decrease in carotid blood flow showed that complete occlusion occurred within 14 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 10 min after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, a test drug (YM866, t-PA, or saline) was administered by i.v. bolus injection under heparinization (300 IU/kg, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both YM866 and t-PA exhibited dose-dependent thrombolytic activity; the reperfusion rate of YM866 was twice that of t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in time to reperfusion between the agents, but YM866 showed a greater improvement in patency status after successful thrombolysis than t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinogen fell slightly but significantly (14% of baseline value) in animals given 1 mg/kg of YM866 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups of rats showed a significant decrease in carotid artery blood flow at 1 hr after successful reperfusion or injection of the drug, but this decrease showed significant recovery in animals given 1 mg/kg of YM866 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that YM866 by single bolus injection is a superior thrombolytic agent to t-PA, and that YM866 can improve the patency status after successful thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this platelet-rich <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model permits continuous observation of the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and subsequent thrombolysis and provides a useful tool for the screening and evaluation of efficacy of new antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
