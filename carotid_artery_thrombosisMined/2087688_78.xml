<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small thermocouple transducers were fabricated from readily available materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A thermocouple was inserted under a carotid artery of the anesthetized rat and vessel temperature was recorded continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial injury was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> solution applied topically to the artery above the thermocouple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To validate the relationship between thrombotic occlusion and vessel temperature, blood flow velocity, proximal to the injury, and temperature were recorded simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Temperature decreased rapidly when velocity averaged 24 +/- 12 percent of control and velocity did not differ from zero within 20 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessels, average flow velocity did not decrease significantly from control until a fixed stenosis decreased diameter by 78 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average time to occlusion (TTO), signaled by the abrupt temperature inflection, ranged from 56 +/- 4 min to 14 +/- 1 min after 10 and 65 percent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> application respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vessel segments were fixed at various times after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> exposure and examined by scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endothelial damage was observed and was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> composed of activated platelets, fibrin strands and entrapped erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> dose-dependently induced formation of an occlusive mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that was indexed by monitoring the time between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> application and a rapid temperature decrease in the carotid artery of the rat </plain></SENT>
