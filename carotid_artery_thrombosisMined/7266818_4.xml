<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of an 18-year-old man who sustained a minor head and neck injury during a fist fight and developed a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> resulting from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the supraclinoid portion of the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conservative inpatient treatment with low dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin resulted in a gradual, steady improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two months later, after an intensive program of physical therapy, the patient showed good progress; his facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> had lessened and his left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although there is no ideal treatment for internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> secondary to minor trauma, conservative treatment should be undertaken unless there are progressive or recurring ischemic symptoms, in which case an extracranial-intracranial bypass operation should be considered </plain></SENT>
