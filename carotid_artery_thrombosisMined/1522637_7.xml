<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The traditional approach to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> has been repeat endarterectomy or patch angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concern with the durability of repeat carotid endarterectomy has resulted in our use of carotid resection with autogenous graft interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the outcome and efficacy of carotid resection compared with repeat carotid endarterectomy in the management of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1974 to 1991, 162 operations (repeat carotid endarterectomy 105, carotid resection 57) were performed for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indication for operation was hemispheric symptoms in 63% of patients, nonlateralizing symptoms in 25%, asymptomatic stenosis in 7%, and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one percent of patients had stenosis greater than 90% on arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate for carotid resection was 3.5%, with a subsequent rate of 0.0064 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For repeat carotid endarterectomy, the perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 1.9% with a subsequent rate of 0.011 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Graft patency after carotid resection was 93% (mean follow-up, 35 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients treated with carotid resection had graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and two of the four remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After repeat carotid endarterectomy, one patient had carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and recurrent stenosis greater than 50% developed in 23 patients (mean follow-up, 64 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients treated with repeat carotid endarterectomy underwent an additional operation for further symptomatic recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude carotid resection is a safe and effective alternative to repeat carotid endarterectomy for patients undergoing operation for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
