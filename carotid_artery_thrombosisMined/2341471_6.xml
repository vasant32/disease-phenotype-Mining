<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indication for surgery was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in 67.4%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 22.7% and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in 10.0% of the operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall major cerebral complication rate attending the operation was 9.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the last four years' period from 1981 to 1984 the procedure morbidity was 3.6% and there was no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications comprised 31 ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and one contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; the complications occurred during the first 24 hours in 28 cases and on the fourth or fifth day in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients 11 succumbed to internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and one to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associated factors for major complications were analyzed retrospectively in the light of 32 parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients of advanced age, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005978'>type II diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery, negative smoking history and those undergoing a second operation proved to be at high risk of early postoperative cerebral complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These complications can be reduced by intraoperative use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, preoperative <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> treatment and a short clamping time </plain></SENT>
