<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL: The authors report on a case of a partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient had outcomes of pulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dealt with surgical removal of the medium right lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At admission, the neurological examination evidenced non specific neurological deficits to both the advanced limbs above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood test evidenced 628000 platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The color-doppler showed in the internal carotid artery of right the presence of floating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, during very small fibro-calcified plate, likely ulcerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient was submitted to surgical urgent procedure without ulterior diagnostic deepening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such attitude was justified from the total regression of the symptomatology and from the absence of alterations of the BEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The urgent surgical treatment has had good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In literature there are similar cases but not place upon ones because of "aetiology" to the inner presence of floating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in carotid not completely occluding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and the three cases, causes do not correspond from alters platelet parameters, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was of cardiogenic origin in one case, it was caused by hormonal therapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterility</z:mp> in the second, there was <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We remark the importance of eco-color Doppler for urgent diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and timeliness of surgical treatment in the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>" patient with attenuation or regression of the debut symptomatology </plain></SENT>
