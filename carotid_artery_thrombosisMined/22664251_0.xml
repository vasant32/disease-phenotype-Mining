<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Preclinical pharmacological characterization of a novel inhibitor (UM8190) of prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We synthesized and evaluated a library of proline-based analogs as prospective recombinant PRCP (rPRCP) inhibitors and inhibitors of PRCP-dependent prekallikrein (PK) activation on human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the newly synthesized compounds, UM8190 was further characterized in vivo using methods that encompassed a mouse carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model and animal model of food consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(S)-N-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23870">dodecyl</z:chebi>-1-((S)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274">pyrrolidine-2-carbonyl</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> [Compound 3 (UM8190)] was selected for further evaluation from the initial assessment of its PRCP inhibitory action (K(i)= 43 μM) coupled with its ability to block PRCP-dependent PK activation on HPAEC (K(i)= 34 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UM8190 demonstrated excellent selectivity against a panel of carboxypeptidases and serine proteases and blocked bradykinin (BK) generation and BK-induced permeability by 100%, suggesting that it may be useful in preventing the local production of large amounts of BK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, UM8190 showed an anorexigenic effect when systemically administered to fasted mice, reducing food intake in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a mouse carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, it also demonstrated an antithrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>UM8190 is a selective PRCP inhibitor and it may represent a new anorexigenic, and antithrombotic drug, that works by inhibiting PRCP-mediated mechanisms </plain></SENT>
