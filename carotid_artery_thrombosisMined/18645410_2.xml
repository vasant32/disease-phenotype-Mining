<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Factor Xa (FXa) has been a target of considerable interest for drug development efforts aimed at suppressing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, a new orally active, small molecule, active-site directed FXa inhibitor, GW813893, has been profiled in a succession of in vitro and in vivo assays involved in its preclinical characterization as a potential antithrombotic therapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro profiling of GW813893 consisted of assessing its inhibitory potential against FXa and a broad panel of related and unrelated enzymes and receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the FXa inhibition potential of GW813893 was assessed in prothrombinase and plasma-based clotting assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo characterization of GW813893 consisted of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> studies in a rat inferior vena cava model, a rat carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, and a rabbit jugular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> studies were conducted in a rat tail transection model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo determinations of compound effects on FX and clotting activity were also undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GW813893 was more than 90-fold selective over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> enzymes tested, and it inhibited FXa and prothrombinase activity with a Ki of 4.0 nM and 9.7 nM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, GW813893 concentration-dependently suppressed thrombotic activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> models tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic activity correlated with the suppression of plasma-based clotting activity and the inhibition of plasma FX activity (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the antithrombotic dose-range, an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding diathesis</z:hpo> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These experiments demonstrate that GW813893 is a potent, selective, orally active inhibitor of FXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that GW813893 has robust antithrombotic potential at doses that have no detectable hemostasis liability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the profile suggests that GW813893 has the preclinical pharmacology underpinnings of an oral antithrombotic therapeutic </plain></SENT>
