<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>JTV-926 released tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) from human vascular endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The thrombolytic effect of JTV-926 was studied using three animal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models; a photo-irradiation-induced mouse carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, a photo-irradiation-induced rat femoral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model and a thrombin-induced rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, t-PA deficient mice (t-PA-/- mice) and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (t-PA+/+) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>JTV-926 was injected as a bolus 30 min after the interruption of blood flow by an occlusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was continuously monitored for 180 min after intravenous administration of JTV-926 (1 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the recanalization rate of the occluded artery was 37.5% in t-PA +/+ mice with the vehicle control, it increased to 75% in t-PA+/+ mice after JTV-926 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when JTV-926 was administrated in t-PA-/- mice, vascular recanalization was not observed in any arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the photo-irradiation-induced rat femoral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, intra-duodenal administration of JTV-926 induced thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the thrombin-induced rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> model, the dose-dependent thrombolysis was also observed by oral administration of JTV-926 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that JTV-926 revealed a sufficient thrombolytic effect through the absorption from the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, a newly synthesized compound, JTV-926 induced t-PA release from vascular endothelial cells and effective thrombolysis in vivo </plain></SENT>
