<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There would be value in a simple model of this process to evaluate the mechanisms involved in antibody-mediated damage and the development of accommodation, as well as the impact of potential interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have thus developed a novel large animal model of this process using an allosensitisation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two inbred lines of miniature pigs that carry different major histocompatibility antigen haplotypes were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pigs of one line were sensitised by the sequential subcutaneous injection of major histocompatibility antigen-mismatched allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from the other inbred line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that this generated high titres of allospecific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then transplanted carotid arteries from donors syngeneic to the priming cells into the sensitised animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 48 h these vessels showed a profound mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate in both intima and media, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> compromise with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and antibody deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean endothelial surface affected by this process was 59.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No such pathology was seen in any of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This model is technically simple to perform with few post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It provides proof-of-principle of a model of antibody-mediated rejection which will be of potential value in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the process and the efficacy of interventions to prevent or treat it </plain></SENT>
