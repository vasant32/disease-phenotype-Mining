<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embolization was detected in 92 per cent of successfully monitored operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most emboli were characteristic of air and not associated with adverse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, more than ten particulate emboli during initial carotid dissection correlated with a significant deterioration in postoperative cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A relationship between persistent particulate embolization in the immediate postoperative period, and both incipient carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the development of major neurological deficits was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediate intervention, based on TCD evidence of embolization, has the potential to avert neurological deficits resulting from particulate embolization </plain></SENT>
