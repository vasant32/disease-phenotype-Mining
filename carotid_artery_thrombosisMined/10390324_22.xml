<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the effects of the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi>-5'-diphosphocholine (citicoline) and thrombolysis on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, clinical outcome, and mortality in a rat embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-three Sprague-Dawley rats were embolized in the carotid territory with a single fibrin <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and randomly assigned to the following treatment groups: (1) control (saline), (2) citicoline 250 mg/kg, (3) citicoline 500 mg/kg, (4) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) 5 mg/kg, (5) rtPA 5 mg/kg plus citicoline 250 mg/kg, and (6) rtPA 5 mg/kg plus citicoline 500 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rtPA was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over 45 minutes starting 45 minutes after embolization; citicoline was given intraperitoneally 30 minutes and 24, 48, and 72 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 96 hours, the brains were fixed and stained by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores were determined daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, measured as percentage of the affected hemisphere, in the control group was 37% (interquartile range, 26% to 69%) compared with 22% (5% to 52%; P=NS) in group 2, 11% (5% to 34%; P=NS) in group 3, 24% (12% to 31%; P=NS) in group 4, 11% (3% to 22%; P=0.02) in the combined group 5, and 19% (9% to 51%; P=NS) in group 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly reduced in the combined citicoline+rtPA-treated groups to a median of 13% (5% to 30%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Citicoline 500 mg/kg and citicoline combined with rtPA also promoted functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the combination of low-dose citicoline and rtPA significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in this focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
