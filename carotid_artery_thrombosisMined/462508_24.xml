<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific pathologic findings were studied in 50 symptomatic patients who underwent 69 carotid endarterectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed analyses of their carotid plaques included correlations between photographs of gross specimens, microscopic findings, angiograms, preoperative symptoms and long-term postoperative follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaques were primarily fibrous with significant (greater than 70%) stenoses encountered in 70% of the arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stenoses were due to simple fibrous thickening in only 20%; the remainder due to intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, atheromatous debris and, least often, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> with or without ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was frequent in plaques associated with focal neurologic symptoms and may have preceded localized collections of atheromatous debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ulceration occurred in 1/3 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques, symptomatic or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the carotid plaques start as fibrointimal thickening evolving to symptomatic stages by the occurrence of one or more of a number of pathologic changes, intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> being prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single rational therapeutic regimen seems impossible until patients can be classified according to their pathologic changes diagnosed non-invasively </plain></SENT>
