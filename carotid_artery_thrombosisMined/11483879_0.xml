<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the long-term antithrombotic efficacy of a direct fXa inhibitor, FXV673, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> after short-term infusion in conscious dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dogs were instrumented surgically to induce carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by electrolytic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day 1, dogs received a 3-h infusion of placebo (n = 10), FXV673 (100 microg/kg + 10 microg/kg/min, n = 7), or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (60 U/kg + 0.7 U/kg/min, n 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injury (100 microA) was initiated concomitantly for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The procedure was repeated on day 2 with injury of 200 microA for 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery blood flow (CBF) and coagulation parameters were monitored continuously for 3 h on days 1 and 2 and for 30 min on days 3, 4, and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 1 at 3 h, CBF in the placebo-treated group was 26% of baseline with 70% incidence of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the vessels occluded in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and FXV673 groups; however, the CBF was significantly higher in the FXV673 group (92+/-8 ml/min versus 39+/-12 ml/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Before injury on day 2, CBF recovered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups to 71-89% of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the second injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vessels in the placebo-treated group progressed to complete occlusion by 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CBF was significantly higher in FXV673 group compared with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> throughout the 3-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On days 3, 4, and 5 the placebo-treated vessels remained occluded, but the CBF in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group was 33+/-20 ml/min, 55+/-11 ml/min and 68+/-12 ml/min, respectively, compared with 84+/-10 ml/min, 98+/-7 ml/min, and 99+/-10 ml/min in the FXV673 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mass was significantly lower in FXV673 group (13+/-4 mg) compared with placebo (103+/-10 mg) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (44+/-11 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data demonstrate that short-term infusion of FXV673 was associated with long-term efficacy that was superior to standard <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and underscore the role of direct fXa inhibition in arterial passivation </plain></SENT>
