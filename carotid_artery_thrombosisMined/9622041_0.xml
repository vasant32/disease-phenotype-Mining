<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FK633 at 0.32 mg/kg i.v. or aspirin at 10 mg/ kg i.v. inhibited ex vivo collagen-induced aggregation by &gt;50% for 1 hour in guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, aspirin was very weak in inhibiting <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo antithrombotic effects of FK633 and aspirin were compared using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi>-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 0.32 mg/kg i.v. of FK633 significantly prevented occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, but aspirin at 10 mg/kg i.v. did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In thrombolysis experiments, adjunctive use of FK633 (0.32 mg/kg i.v.) with rt-PA (0.3 mg/kg bolus+1.0 mg/kg/hr) achieved reperfusion in five of five animals without reocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspirin (10O mg/kg i.v.) with rt-PA also achieved reperfusion in three of five animals with high incidence of reocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that FK633 may be a more effective antithrombotic agent than aspirin due to its <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-independent antiplatelet effects </plain></SENT>
