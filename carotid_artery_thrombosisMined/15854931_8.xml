<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that aprotinin provides hemostasis while reducing vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by attenuating protease-dependent platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbits (3 to 4 kg) underwent carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induced by electrical current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment animals (n = 8) received aprotinin by a 100,000-KIU bolus followed by a continuous infusion (25,000 KIU/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals (n = 8) received crystalloid solution </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was examined in response to protease-dependent (thrombin) and protease-independent (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) platelet <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet thrombin protease-activated receptor (PAR) expression was analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ear <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time and abdominal incisional <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were measured at baseline and serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> weight was decreased by aprotinin (6.1 +/- 1.1 mg versus 10.8 +/- 1.5 mg, aprotinin versus control, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Time to thrombotic occlusion was prolonged in the aprotinin group (17.4 +/- 1.0 minutes versus 8.3 +/- 1.3 minutes, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rabbit platelet expression of thrombin PARs was demonstrated by Western blot analysis, and was not altered by aprotinin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation due to thrombin was decreased by aprotinin therapy (59.2% +/- 3.0% versus 95.8% +/- 1.5%, p &lt; 0.001), whereas protease-independent, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation was unchanged with aprotinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Incisional <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was not different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the aprotinin group, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time was unchanged at baseline and then reduced for the duration of the experiment (35.0 +/- 4.7 seconds versus 76.8 +/- 6.4 seconds, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While providing hemostatic effects, aprotinin attenuates vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in part by inhibition of PAR activation, resulting in the prevention of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
