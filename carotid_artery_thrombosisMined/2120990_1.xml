<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the thrombogenicity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, and endothelial response to the presence of sterilized, 1-French <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> catheters implanted into the arterial system and subcutaneous tissues of 18 rats and two dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At time periods ranging from 1 week to 6 months, repeat angiography was done, the animals sacrificed, and the tissues containing the catheter removed for histologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the subcutaneous tissues the catheter became encased in a very thin (less than 0.5 mm) coating of fibrous tissue with no evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In large vessels, the catheter at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time periods appeared identical both angiographically and histologically to that at the time of implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In small to medium-sized vessels a slight increase in vessel size (25% increase in diameter of the rat iliac) was observed angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On histologic evaluation, there was evidence of myointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, which was asymmetrically placed, centered around the position of the catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> or of incorporation of the catheter itself into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_631'>hypertrophic tissue</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In dogs and rats, an implanted 1-French <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> catheter is well tolerated: the animals showed no evidence of thrombotic, thromboembolic, or inflammatory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was observed in small to medium-sized arteries, which is of unknown significance </plain></SENT>
