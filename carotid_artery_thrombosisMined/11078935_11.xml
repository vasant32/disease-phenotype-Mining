<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tested the requirement for hsp72 expression in a gerbil tolerance model in which postischemic temperature was varied to modulate the level of hsp72 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were subjected to 2 min bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and kept under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia for 90 min, during which rectal temperature was either maintained at 37 degrees C (normothermic, NT) or elevated to 39.5 degrees C (hyperthermic, HT) during 15-60 min recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hsp72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was determined by in situ hybridization with a (35)S-labeled oligonucleotide probe at 3, 24 and 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separate groups were subjected to a test challenge of 5 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 48 h after the priming insult, and CA1 neuron counts were obtained at 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant protection was observed in both NT and HT groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, while 90% of hippocampi from NT animals showed detectable protection of CA1 neurons, less than half showed detectable hsp72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, within the limits of experimental detection, hsp72 expression is not required for induction of ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
