<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An embolic source in the setting of minimal stenosis at the carotid bifurcation has rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report a previously healthy 48-year-old woman, without any risk factors for cerebrovascular events, sustained multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> in the right anterior and middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated imaging of the heart and cerebral vessels missed a very small abnormality arising from the posterior wall of the internal carotid artery, until it was diagnosed by computed tomographic angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is problematic because by North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria, minimal stenosis essentially excludes the carotid artery as an embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite maximum antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy, she continued to have neurological deteriortation by progression of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She underwent standard carotid endarterectomy and sustained no new embolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination showed an endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with organizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, which on the posterior wall of the internal carotid artery, is likely a hemodynamically induced on top of preexisting atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
