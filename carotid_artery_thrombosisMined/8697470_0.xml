<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The extrinsic coagulation pathway is activated when tissue factor (TF) is exposed as a consequence of arterial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TF binds to factor VII (FVII) or activated FVII (FVIIa), generating a complex that activates both FX and FIX, ultimately leading to thrombin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether inhibition of FVII binding to TF would result in antithrombotic effects, active site-blocked FVIIa (FVIIai) was used in a rabbit model of intravascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, to study the interaction between extrinsic coagulation pathway activation and platelet aggregation, in the same model of intravascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, recombinant human FVIIa was administered in antiplatelet-treated rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cyclic flow variations (CFVs), due to recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, were initiated by placing an external constrictor around the endothelially-injured rabbit carotid arteries (Folt's model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid blood flow was measured continuously by a Doppler flow probe placed proximally to the constrictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CFVs were induced in 29 New Zealand White rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After CFVs were observed for 30 min, the animals were randomly divided in four groups: 5 animals received via a small catheter (26G) placed proximally to the stenosis, an intra-arterial infusion of human recombinant FVIIai (0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min); 9 animals received AP-1, a monoclonal antibody against rabbit TF (0.1 mg/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>bolus); 7 animals received ridogrel, a dual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>bolus); finally, 8 rabbits received aurintrycarboxilic acid (ATA), an inhibitor of platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ib/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor interaction (10 mg/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>bolus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FVIIai abolished CFVs in 5 of 5 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p &lt; 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 106 +/- 9% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AP-1 abolished CFVs in 7 of 9 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p &lt; 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 58 +/- 35% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals receiving ridogrel or ATA CFVs were abolished (CFV frequency 0 cycles/hour; p &lt; 0.05 in both groups; carotid blood flow velocity, respectively 62 +/- 32 and 66 +/- 40% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline in both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes following inhibition of CFVs, in the FVIIai treated rabbits, human recombinant FVIIa was infused, via the small catheter placed proximally to the stenosis, at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the other three groups, FVIIa, at the same dose, was infused i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Infusion of FVIIa restored CFVs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FVIIai treated animals and in 6 of 7 AP-1 treated animals, thus indicating that AP-1 and FVIIai bindings to TF was competitive and was replaced by FVIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Infusion of FVIIa failed to restore CFVs in ridogrel e ATA treated rabbits (1 of 7 and 0 of 8 rabbits, respectively), showing that activation of extrinsic coagulation by FVIIa was overcome by inhibition of platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Activated partial thromboplastin time, and ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and thrombin, were not different after FVIIai infusion, while prothrombin time was slightly but significantly prolonged as compared to baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thus, FVII-VIIa plays an important role in initiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Administration of FVIIai exerts a potent antithrombotic effects in this model without affecting systemic coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In addition, in this model platelets exert an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, since in the presence of inhibition of platelet function, activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway failed to restore <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
