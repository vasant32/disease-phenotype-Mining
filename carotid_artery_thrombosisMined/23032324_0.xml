<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lectin pathway initiation complexes are composed of multimolecular carbohydrate recognition subcomponents and 3 lectin pathway-specific serine proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that the lectin pathway-specific carbohydrate recognition subcomponent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that the endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL)/ficolin-associated protein-1 (MAP-1) that inhibits complement activation in vitro also could be an in vivo regulator by attenuating myocardial schema/reperfusion injury and thrombogenesis when used at pharmacological doses in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 2 mouse models, MAP-1 preserves cardiac function, decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, decreases C3 deposition, inhibits MBL deposition, and prevents thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAP-1 displaces MBL/ficolin-associated serine protease (MASP)-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3 from the MBL complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the natural, endogenous inhibitor MAP-1 effectively inhibits lectin pathway activation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAP-1 at pharmacological doses represents a novel therapeutic approach for human diseases involving the lectin pathway and its associated MASPs </plain></SENT>
