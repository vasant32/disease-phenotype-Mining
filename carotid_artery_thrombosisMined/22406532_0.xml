<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical use of niacin to treat dyslipidemic conditions is limited by noxious side effects, most commonly facial flushing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mice, niacin-induced flushing results from COX-1-dependent formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>₂ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>₂ followed by COX-2-dependent production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>₂ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, niacin-induced flushing in humans is attenuated when niacin is combined with an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>₂ receptor DP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>-mediated suppression of COX-2-derived <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>₂ has negative cardiovascular consequences, yet little is known about the cardiovascular biology of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>₂ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>₂ biosynthesis is augmented during platelet activation in humans and, although vascular expression of DP1 is conserved between humans and mice, platelet DP1 is not present in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, DP1 deletion in mice augmented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and the hypertensive response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> and accelerated atherogenesis and thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, COX inhibitors in humans, as well as platelet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, COX-1 knockdown, and COX-2 deletion in mice, revealed that niacin evoked platelet COX-1-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>₂ biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced spreading on fibrinogen was augmented by niacin in washed human platelets, coincident with increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> (Tx) formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in platelet-rich plasma, where formation of both Tx and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>₂ was increased, spreading was not as pronounced and was inhibited by DP1 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>₂, like <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>₂, may function as a homeostatic response to thrombogenic and hypertensive stimuli and may have particular relevance as a constraint on platelets during niacin therapy </plain></SENT>
