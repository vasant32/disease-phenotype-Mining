<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies demonstrated that orally administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a rat jugular vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, where bovine unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH) and the low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> tinzaparin reduced thrombotic incidence by 50% at 7.5 and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to determine if similar antithrombotic effects of oral <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> could be observed in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this model, filter paper soaked in 30% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> was applied to the exposed rat carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A flowmeter recorded blood flow over a 60 min period determining time when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> began forming (TTB) and time till occlusion (TTO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately following, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was removed, dried and weighed 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bovine UFH (7.5 mg/kg), tinzaparin (0.1 mg/kg) or saline was administered by stomach tube at 2, 5 and 25 h prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TTB was significantly increased when UFH was given at 5 and 25 h but not 2 h prior, and when tinzaparin was given at 5 but not 2 or 25 h prior compared to rats given oral saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TTO was significantly increased for both UFH and tinzaparin when given 5 and 25 h but not 2 h prior (one-way ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in TTO and TTB between UFH and tinzaparin treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A trend in reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight was observed for UFH at 5 and 25 h prior and tinzaparin at 5 h prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> initiation (one-way ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although no significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin times, Heptest or anti-Xa activity from plasma of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treated rats, endothelial <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly greater than controls for UFH at 5 h and for tinzaparin at 2, 5, and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> administered by the oral route are effective antithrombotic agents in arterial as well as venous models </plain></SENT>
