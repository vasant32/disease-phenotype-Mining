<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An open study of intravenous rtPA in 100 patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> between 20 and 81 years of age, with a baseline Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SSS) score of &lt;48 at entry was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion time was within 7 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rtPA (0.8 mg/kg) was infused for 90 minutes, with an initial 10% bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was given according to 3 consecutive protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SSS evaluation was done on days 0, 1, 7, 30, and 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scan was performed before treatment, on days 1 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Etiological investigations included echocardiography and carotid Doppler sonography and/or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome at 1 year was documented by SSS score, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and a 10-point invalidity scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of poor versus good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At day 90, 45 patients (45%) had a good result, defined as complete regression or slight neurological sequelae (mRS score of 0-1), 18 patients had a moderate outcome (mRS 2-3), and 31 patients had serious neurological sequelae (mRS 4-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients died, 2 with intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> after immediate <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five of 11 patients (45.5%) treated between 6 and 7 hours had a good result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> rate was 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Higher values of fibrin degradation products at 2 hours were observed in the subgroup with intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of poor outcome on multivariate logistic regression analysis were baseline SSS score of &lt;15 (odds ratio [OR], 3.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>74; P=0.04), indistinction between white and gray matter on CT scan (OR, 6.59; 95% CI, 2.19 to 19.79; P=0.0008), and proximal internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 0.99 to 10.95; P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the safety of intravenous rtPA at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg and suggests efficacy for this drug even within 7 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Outcome and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> rates were at least as favorable as for trials of therapy with a 3-hour time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Subgroups with a poor prognosis include low baseline neurological score, baseline CT changes, and proximal ICA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, approximately 30% of patients with each of these characteristics show a good outcome, so their inclusion in future routine rtPA protocols is still justified </plain></SENT>
