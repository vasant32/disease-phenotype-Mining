<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the correlation of clinical and echo-Doppler findings from the internal carotid artery (ICA) in 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (AF) and in 68 patients with hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (H-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the study population as a whole, moderate stenoses (20%-49% diameter reduction) were the most prevalent finding in the symptomatic ICA, being detectable in 51.6% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total occlusions were found in an unexpectedly high percentage (7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic ICAs, that were contralateral to the symptoms, showed the same degree of atherosclerotic involvement as the symptomatic ICAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When we compared AF with H-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, we found a significantly higher prevalence of severe hemodynamically significant stenoses in the former (52.6% vs. 18.8%, chi-square test 10.85, P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that in the vast majority of patients with transient neurological symptoms a bilateral ICA involvement is to be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The side on which the symptoms occur does not indicate which ICA is more severely stenotic except in AF, where a severe involvement of the ipsilateral ICA is most likely </plain></SENT>
