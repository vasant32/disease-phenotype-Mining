<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four high grade (greater than 50% diameter reduction) internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> and one low grade (less than 50% diameter reduction) stenosis were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The noninvasive findings were confirmed at endarterectomy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulsed Doppler ultrasonic imaging combined with real time spectrum analysis can accurately quantitate the degree of atherosclerotic stenosis at the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experience with these four patients suggests that these techniques can be used in lieu of angiography to evaluate patients who are unable to undergo standard radiographic examination </plain></SENT>
