<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relative infrequency of blunt carotid artery trauma prompted a multicenter review to determine the spectrum of injuries, treatment strategies, and neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During a six-year period, 60 carotid artery injuries from blunt mechanisms in 49 patients were treated at 11 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 11 bilateral injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injury mechanisms were diverse but involved motor vehicles in 35 (72%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 14 (29%) patients, significant neurologic deficits developed more than 12 hours after a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> admission neurologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography in 42 (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duplex ultrasound accurately demonstrated the arterial injury in 12 (86%) of 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Documented injuries included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in 20 arteries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> alone in 19, dissection with pseudoaneurysm in six, pseudoaneurysm alone in five, frank arterial disruption in seven, and carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>Arterial dissection</z:hpo> was managed nonsurgically in 15 (79%) of 19 cases, the majority with systemic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was managed with supportive therapy alone for 16 (80%) of 20 arteries; most associated with fixed neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pseudoaneurysm repair was performed for six (55%) injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were treated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three instances with balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was 16 of 49 patients (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Good neurologic outcome was achieved in 22 (45%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: (1) Neurologic symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion; prior clinical suspicion and diagnostic testing are essential; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> without complete occlusion may effectively be managed by anticoagulation; (3) pseudoaneurysms in accessible anatomic locations can be repaired with good results; and (4) injuries with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> are associated with high mortality and poor neurologic outcome in proportion to the initial degree of neurologic impairment </plain></SENT>
