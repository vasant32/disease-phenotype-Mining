<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that SVAP 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 mg/ml inhibited significantly the rabbit platelet aggregation triggered by 0.3 U/ml thrombin, 10 microM <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> in vitro (P&lt;0.05 or 0.01) and SVAP at the dose of 0.32, 0.64 mg/kg iv prolonged distinctively the occlusion time of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that were induced by electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased% of 0.16, 0.32 and 0.64 mg/kg were 30.16, 71.74, 98.27%, respectively, which showed a good dose-effect relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SVAP 0.22 mg/ml (in vitro) or 0.2, 0.4 mg/kg (in ex vivo) could obviously increase the plasma concentration of 6-keto-PG F1alpha, but slightly effect rats plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> in vitro and in ex vivo and significantly increase of value of PG I2/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>, which suggested that the mechanism of the antithrombotic action of SVAP is related to the resistance against platelet aggregation, increase of the concentration of PG I2 in plasma </plain></SENT>
