<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of 798 patients by Duplex scanning or digital venous angiography 6 months to 13 years after carotid endarterectomy revealed a recurrent stenosis rate of 3.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the recurrent lesions showed a clear correlation with the operative technique: after closure of the arteriotomy directly (continuous suture) or with a vein patch (303 pat.) the recurrent stenosis rate was 4 times higher than after closure with a dacron patch (495 pat.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our investigations indicate that recurrent stenosis and occlusions after carotid endarterectomy are largely avoidable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sufficient length of arteriotomy (5-8 cm), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the distal internal carotid artery and lumen congruent closure of the arteriotomy with a dacron patch are the pivots of success </plain></SENT>
