<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the findings of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) with angiography after stenting for supraaortic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases that underwent both MSCT and angiography were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases, stenotic findings were shown by neither MSCT nor angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lumen diameters measured by MSCT tended to be shorter than those measured by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-stent stenosis evaluated by MSCT was found in 6 cases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them revealed low density areas in the inner stent lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 4 of them, intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was indicated by angiography, but in 2 of them, unexpectedly, no stenotic findings were found by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case, using MSCT the part two stents partially lying over one another revealed severe artifact in the inner stent lumen, but no stenosis was found by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, unevenly spread extra-stent space was found, but that was not revealed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MSCT is useful to evaluate lumen diameter, in-stent intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, in-stent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, and extra-stent space </plain></SENT>
