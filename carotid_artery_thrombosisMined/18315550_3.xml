<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48545">pentapeptides</z:chebi> called Thrombostatin FM compounds consisting mostly of D-isomers and unusual amino acids were prepared based upon the stable angiotensin converting enzyme breakdown product of bradykinin - RPPGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: These <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are direct thrombin inhibitors prolonging the thrombin clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time at &gt;or=0.78, 1.6, and 1.6 microm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They competitively inhibit alpha-thrombin-induced cleavage of a chromogenic substrate at 4.4-8.2 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They do not significantly inhibit plasma kallikrein, factor (F) XIIa, FXIa, FIXa, FVIIa-TF, FXa, plasmin or cathepsin G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One form, FM19 [rOicPaF(p-Me)], blocks alpha-thrombin-induced calcium flux in fibroblasts with an IC(50) of 6.9 +/- 1.2 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FM19 achieved 100% inhibition of threshold alpha- or gamma-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation at 8.4 +/- 4.7 microm and 16 +/- 4 microm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of thrombin in complex with FM19 shows that the N-terminal<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32693"> D-Arg</z:chebi> retrobinds into the S1 pocket, its second residue Oic interacts with His-57, Tyr-60a and Trp-60d, and its C-terminal p-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> Phe engages thrombin's aryl binding site composed of Ile-174, Trp-215, and Leu-99 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When administered intraperitoneal, intraduodenal, or orally to mice, FM19 prolongs thrombin clotting times and delays carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FM19, a low affinity reversible direct thrombin inhibitor, might be useful as an add-on agent to address an unmet need in platelet inhibition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes in diabetics and others who with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> current antiplatelet therapy still have reactive platelets </plain></SENT>
