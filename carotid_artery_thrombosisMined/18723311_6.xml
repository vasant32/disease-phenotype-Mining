<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To lower the risk of complications, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to open surgery for carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> after neck irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 18 and stenosis &gt;50% in 53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical failure occurred during CAS in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall technical success rate was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A cerebral protection device was used in 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred during the first postoperative month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in nine, and restenosis in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Medium-term neurologic outcome was acceptable, but the incidence of anatomic events such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and restenosis was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A randomized study is needed to confirm that the outcome of the endovascular and surgical therapy is comparable in this indication </plain></SENT>
