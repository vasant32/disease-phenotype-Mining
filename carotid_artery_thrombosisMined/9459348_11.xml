<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address its role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced in the carotid artery and the femoral vein of hamsters, following which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> prevention by two different <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of vWF was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> was the anti-human vWF monoclonal antibody AJvW-2, which inhibits the botrocetin and ristocetin induced aggregation of human blood platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AJvW-2 reacts with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> present in the A1 domain of vWF in very different species (human, pig, rabbit, dog, Guinea pig and rat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> was found to be conformational and overlapping with vWF binding sites for aurin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> (ATA), but not for botrocetin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AJvW-2 has affinities for vWF in the absence (Kd = 0.5 +/- 0.03 nmol/l in solution) and in the presence of shear stress (Kd = 3.3 +/- 0.6 nmol/l during perfusion at 1,300 s over subendothelial matrix associated vWF) sufficiently elevated to neutralize vWF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During perfusion of subendothelial matrix with anticoagulated human blood, the surface covered by adhering platelets was reduced by AJvW-2, with IC50s equal to 6.6 +/- 0.34 microg/ml at 1,300 s(-1) and to 1 +/- 0.01 microg/ml at 2,700 s(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a second <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, molecular size gel filtered ATA was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fractionated ATA inhibited platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to matrix with IC50s equal to 0.27 +/- 0.09 mmol/l at 1,300 s(-1) and 0.16 +/- 0.008 mmol/l at 2,700 s(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When administered to hamsters, AJvW-2 prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the injured carotid artery dose-dependently (ED50 = 0.15 +/- 0.01 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> in the similarly injured femoral vein was however also inhibited (ED50 = 0.37 +/- 0.06 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Likewise, fractionated ATA completely inhibited carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (ED50 = 0.42 +/- 0.13 mg/kg), but also interfered with femoral vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (apparent ED50 between 2 and 3 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that antagonizing the vWF A1 domain by AJvW-2 and to a lesser extent also by fractionated ATA, inhibits <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> not only in the arterial but also in the venous circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were prevented at only 3-5-fold higher doses of <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, vWF participates in injury induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
