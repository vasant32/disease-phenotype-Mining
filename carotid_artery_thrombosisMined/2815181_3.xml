<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The area of stenosis of the vessel lumen was determined morphometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severe atherosclerotic stenosis was frequent but was not a prerequisite for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation since specimens from almost one half of the patients had only moderate narrowing of the lumen (less than 60% stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens from three patients showed ulcerations, those from one showed intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and those from one massive plaque rupture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were thought to be important in thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> such types of plaque complications may thus precipitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> but no single complication was particularly predominant, and specimens from one half of the patients showed no complications at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening of the carotid arteries for stenosis can therefore detect only one half of the individuals who ultimately will develop <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and the risk caused by plaque complications seems to be moderate in unselected materials </plain></SENT>
