<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe five cases of giant carotid cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which evolved with spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of internal carotid artery (STICA), with emphasis at epidemiology, clinical presentation, natural history, related factors and neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: There were 711 consecutives patients with 802 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with and without surgical treatment during a period of 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selected 35 patients with 40 carotid cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (5%) of which 20 (50%) were giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among those cases, 5 patients evolved with STICA (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and findings at presentation were recorded and compared with those at outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical presentation was commonly related to atherosclerotic factors such as elevated blood pressure (80%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (40%) and dislipidemy (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with hemicranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, ophthalmparesy and retro bulbar pain, and after STICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presented improvement of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After STICA, 4 patients had regression of deficit, 2 partial and 2 complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had sensorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trigeminal neuropathy</z:e> in V1 and V2 territories, also showing improvement of symptoms after STICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: STICA is a common outcome in giant carotid cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and is related with significant improvement of symptoms; however, it may be catastrophic for those patients without efficient collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
