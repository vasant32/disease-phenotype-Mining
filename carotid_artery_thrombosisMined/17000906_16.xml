<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>Subacute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a major clinical concern, and the search for new molecules to cover stents remains important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">Dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) is used for preservation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and is infused into patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite its intravenous application, the impact of DMSO on vascular cells has not been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In human endothelial cells, monocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), DMSO inhibited tissue factor (TF) expression and activity in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha or thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DMSO did not exert any toxic effects as assessed by phase-contrast microscopy, trypan blue exclusion, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that inhibition of TF expression occurred at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was mediated by reduced activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases c-Jun terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi> kinase (51+/-6%; P=0.0005) and p38 (50+/-3%; P&lt;0.0001) but not p44/42 (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to TF, DMSO did not affect expression of TF pathway inhibitor or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, DMSO treatment suppressed TF activity (41%; P&lt;0.002) and prevented thrombotic occlusion in a mouse carotid artery photochemical injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DMSO also inhibited VSMC proliferation (70%; P=0.005) and migration (77%; P=0.0001) in a concentration-dependent manner; moreover, it prevented <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> and paclitaxel-induced upregulation of TF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DMSO suppresses TF expression and activity, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation; in addition, it inhibits VSMC proliferation and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given its routine use in modern clinical practice, we propose DMSO as a novel strategy for coating drug-eluting stents and treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes </plain></SENT>
