<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of standard unfractionated <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (SH) and low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) on intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was studied in a sheep <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) end-to-side carotid artery vascular graft model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered subcutaneously in a dose of 7250 units twice daily (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enoxaparin, an LMWH, was administered subcutaneously in two different dose regimens of 2 mg/kg (n = 6) and 5 mg/kg (n = 6) daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1 month the animals were killed and the grafts sectioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An intima to media ratio was obtained under light microscopy, using an eyepiece graticule, from measurements taken from the floor of the native artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were analysed with a rank-sum correlation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Control sheep had a median ratio of 0.104, an SH level of 0.021, a low-dose LMWH level of 0.035 and a high-dose LMWH level of 0.017 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between control and SH (P &lt; 0.001), control and high-dose LMWH (P &lt; 0.05), and SH and low-dose LMWH (P &lt; 0.05), but there were no differences between SH and high-dose LMWH or between the two LMWH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both LMWH groups recorded high anti-Xa levels but only slight prolongation of thrombin time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> has a similar effect to SH on the inhibition of fibro-intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in this animal model but is safer, with less <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> potential, and is more convenient to administer as a once-daily dose </plain></SENT>
