<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper concerns the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> coming on in the early postoperative period after successful carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experience in effectively reversing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> in three such consecutive patients forms the basis of this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The value of instant reoperation is emphasized, and several factors that facilitate urgent reoperation have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These include omission of preoperative angiography, immediate reexploration under local anesthesia, and rapid restoration of cerebral flow by insertion of a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our experience would indicate that reversal of neurological deficit in such patients can be accomplished if reoperation is carried out within one hour of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients managed by these criteria recovered and were neurologically intact eight to twelve months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are in contrast to the failure to reverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> noted by us and others when the above measures were not followed </plain></SENT>
