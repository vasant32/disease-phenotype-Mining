<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial duplex scanning was performed during an 18-month period on 124 vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of this duplex scan review revealed the following data: A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scan was obtained in 87/124 (70.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrent stenosis was identified in 35/124 (28.1%), and an occluded vessel was identified in 2/124 (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the total recurrent stenosis group, recurrent stenosis was graded mild in 22/124 (17.7%), moderate in 7/124 (5.6%), and severe in 6/124 (4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 35 vessels with recurrent stenosis by duplex scanning, 22/35 (62.8%) were in female patients, and 13/35 (37.2%) were in male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the vessels with severe recurrent stenosis, 5/6 (83%) were in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrent stenosis following carotid endarterectomy is more common than appreciated clinically, and female patients in particular may be more prone to recurrent stenosis </plain></SENT>
