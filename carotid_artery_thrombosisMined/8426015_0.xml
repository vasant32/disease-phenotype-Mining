<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the in vivo effects of increasing doses of prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) on arterial vasoconstriction, platelet deposition and their interrelation after balloon injury of porcine carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Extensive platelet deposition and localized vasoconstriction occur acutely after arterial injury in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The platelet deposition and vasoconstriction are directly correlated, and previous studies suggest that platelets may mediate the vasoconstrictive response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether vasoconstriction contributes to platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven pigs received an intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> at 10 ng/kg per min (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> 10), 8 pigs at 50 ng/kg per min (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> 50) and 4 pigs at 500 ng/kg per min (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> 500); 24 pigs with saline infusion served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vasoconstriction immediately proximal and distal to the balloon-dilated carotid arterial segment where selective endothelial injury occurred was directly related to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111-labeled platelet deposition within the dilated segment in both control pigs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>-treated pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this relation was such that for any given level of platelet deposition relative to control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0003026'>decreased vasoconstriction</z:mp> in a dose-related manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the treatments (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> 10, 50 or 500) decreased quantitative 111In-labeled platelet deposition or the proportion of deeply injured arteries with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> (91%, 70% or 75%, respectively, p = NS) compared with values in control pigs (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, vasoconstriction was directly related to platelet deposition in control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>-treated animals, but vasodilation alone did not decrease platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> significantly decreases vasoconstriction but not platelet deposition or mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after arterial injury by balloon dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is therefore unlikely that vasoconstriction mediates platelet deposition in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At hemodynamically tolerated doses, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> infusion probably will not prevent the thrombotic complications associated with angioplasty </plain></SENT>
