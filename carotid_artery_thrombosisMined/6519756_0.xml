<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether atherosclerotic complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> can be prevented is more problematic and may depend on effects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> other than the reduction of blood pressure, such as effects on plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and possibly hemodynamic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following discussion summarizes a series of studies that suggest that the hemodynamic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> may be an important aspect of this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In studies in rhesus monkeys and hypertensive patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> were shown to have differing effects on blood velocity and heart rate, important parameters in the genesis of arterial flow disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, hydralazine increased, whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> reduced, the occurrence of abnormal high-velocity flow patterns associated with turbulence and vortex formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a hypertensive (one kidney, one-clip) cholesterol-fed rabbit model, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> was significantly more effective than hydralazine in preventing the occurrence of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the cardioprotective effect of beta blockers may extend to an antiatherosclerotic effect by hemodynamic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is being further tested in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
