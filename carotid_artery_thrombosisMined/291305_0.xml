<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>94% of the animals died within a few minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated to what extent these lethal effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (possibly caused by embolizing platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>) can be prevented by potential antithrombotic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As indicated in the tables the animals are protected by some compounds, especially the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi>, in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the results of this in vivo model showed no correlation with the potency of the drugs for inhibiting platelet aggregation and inhibition of experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is therefore reasonable to assume that the drug effects in this model reflect an overall inhibition of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxanes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
