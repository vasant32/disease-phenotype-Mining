<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this 6-year period, carotid artery restenosis was detected in eleven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had been operated upon initially in the department: carotid thromboendarterectomy (10 cases), internal saphenous vein graft (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient were asymptomatic at time of diagnosis of restenosis, the mean a period of which was 20.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identification was by cervical murmur (5 cases), routine review Doppler examination (2 cases), digital subtraction angiography by arterial approach (2 cases); this examination being conducted on contralateral carotid artery during preoperative investigations, and conventional arteriography of supra-aortic trunks to determine permeability of a contralateral temporo-sylvian anastomosis in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography by the arterial approach was carried out in 8 of the 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apart from the simplicity of repeated examinations (16 times in these 8 patients) this procedure permitted medical treatment to be instituted for 2 cases of restenosis and was sufficient to indicate the need for 5 repeat operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 6 recovery operations were performed, one in a symptomatic patient and five in asymptomatic patients: rapid surgery was necessary in 4 of these because of an immediate critical restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgery was carried out in the last case due to progressive worsening of repeated stenotic lesions on serial angiographic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Operations included venous grafts (crural internal saphenous vein) in 4 cases and angioplasty with venous patch grafts in 2 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
