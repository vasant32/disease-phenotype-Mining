<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This is a report of the operative findings and results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) when the conventional arteriogram demonstrates an internal carotid artery with a high-grade origin stenosis and a small or poorly visualized distal extracranial segment with an apparent diameter of 2 mm or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen CEA were performed on 17 patients with this preoperative finding and patent common and external carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indications for CEA were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in seven patients, completed minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in five and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had bilateral findings and global cerebral ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At CEA 16 internal carotid arteries had atherosclerotic very high-grade origin stenosis, and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 16 open arteries had true external diameters of 4 mm or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, seven were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> above the stenosis, two had a long, trailing intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that was removed, and one had high-grade distal stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the six arteries with true diameters of 3 mm or less (hypoplastic), two had a thick fibrotic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The carotid stump back pressure for the 16 open internal carotid arteries was 56 +/- 15 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was significantly higher than the 39 +/- 14 mm Hg back pressure measured in 1016 arteries without a string sign (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was one 30-day postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no systemic or neurologic morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-CEA duplex scans demonstrated eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, five mildly stenotic, and five occluded internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two of the occlusions were found at CEA and the other three occluded arteries had low flow after CEA, two of which were hypoplastic and the other had a distal stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with symptoms with these findings on arteriograms should undergo CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the success of CEA in this setting depends on the internal carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and disease, which is difficult to determine before CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with a truly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> extracranial internal carotid artery have an excellent probability of a successful CEA, but this is not the case when the artery is small or fibrotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Low internal carotid artery flow after a technically satisfactory CEA is a harbinger of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and should be managed by internal carotid artery ligation and external CEA </plain></SENT>
