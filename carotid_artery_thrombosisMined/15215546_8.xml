<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of echo-planar T2*-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) sequences in detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involving the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging within 6 hours after clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination included echo-planar T2*-weighted, diffusion-weighted (DW), and perfusion-weighted (PW) imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presence or absence of the susceptibility sign on echo-planar T2*-weighted images, which is indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic occlusion involving <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ICA, was assessed in consensus by two observers blinded to clinical information and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in lesion volume on DW and PW images between patients with and those without the susceptibility sign were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P &lt;.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients (71%) had a positive susceptibility sign that correlated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ICA occlusion at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean lesion volume on PW images was higher in patients with a positive susceptibility sign (P =.01), but no significant differences were found in mean lesion volume on DW images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cases in which the susceptibility sign was identified proximal to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> divisional bifurcation (27 patients) showed a mean perfusion deficit of 83.9% of the total <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (range, 50%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Presence of the susceptibility sign proximal to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation provides fast and accurate detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ICA thrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
