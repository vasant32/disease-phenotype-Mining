<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In concordance with the angiographically proven high percentage of significant extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, six of the eight patients examined had an increased platelet accumulation in the carotid artery clinically affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiography and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> attack the platelet scintigraphy even revealed a pathological platelet accumulation in the ipsilateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm the hypothesis that most <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> attacks are due to arterio-arterial emboli originating from atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
