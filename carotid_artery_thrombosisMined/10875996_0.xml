<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study analyzes the role of oculopneumoplethysmography (OPG/Gee) in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CAT) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a timely fashion for immediate exploration, and minimizing unnecessary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with neurologic deficits that were noticed after CEA in the operating or recovery room had immediate OPG/Gee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a positive OPG underwent immediate exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a negative OPG had a duplex ultrasound (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>), and if positive for &gt;/=50% stenosis, the patient underwent exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> was negative, the patient underwent cerebral computed tomography scanning and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one of 53 (58%) had a positive OPG, 30 (97%) of whom had CAT on exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of 53 (42%) with a negative OPG had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>, 4 of whom had &gt;/=50% stenosis (1 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) that was confirmed by exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 18 patients had a negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> that was confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OPG had an overall accuracy of 96% in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CAT, with a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 97%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined OPG and selective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> had an overall accuracy of 98% in detecting surgically correctable lesions, with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity 97% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and 100% NPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mandatory exploration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 53 patients would have resulted in 19 (36%) unnecessary surgeries versus 1 of 53 (2%) if exploration had been done based on OPG with selective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even if exploration was done based only on the OPG, 30 of 34 surgical lesions would have been explored within a few minutes; only 4 would have been delayed until a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OPG/Gee is very sensitive and timely in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CAT, and carotid exploration in these patients can improve the results of CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also minimizes unnecessary explorations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with a negative OPG should undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>, and if positive, they should undergo exploration </plain></SENT>
