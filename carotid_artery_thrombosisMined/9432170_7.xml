<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We assessed the performance of T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in detecting atherosclerotic fibrous caps and in depicting their integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> removed by carotid endarterectomy were imaged on a 1.5-T system using T2-weighted spin-echo sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were reviewed independently by four blinded interpreters for fibrous caps and ruptures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results obtained from the observers were then graded against histologic findings by using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve for fibrous cap detection was 0.80, indicating that T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was a good but not definitively diagnostic test for detecting ex vivo fibrous caps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ROC curve for fibrous cap characterization yielded an area of 0.75, indicating that T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was a fair but not highly diagnostic test for depicting fibrous cap integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A definite reading for detection of fibrous caps or rupture was fairly specific (90% and 98%, respectively) but not very sensitive (37% and 12%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of ex vivo atherosclerotic plaques aided in the detection and evaluation of fibrous caps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging proved more useful for ruling out disease than for confirming its presence </plain></SENT>
