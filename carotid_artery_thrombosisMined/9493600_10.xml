<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the antithrombotic activity of a novel synthetic inhibitor of factor Xa, YM-60828, in an electrically-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, the antithrombotic activity of YM-60828 after i.v. infusion was compared with those of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, darteparin and argatroban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Test drug was administered by i.v. infusion from 30 min before electrical stimulation to the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>YM-60828 at 1 mg/kg/h significantly improved patency status, prolonged the time to occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and duration of patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> at 300 U/kg/h also improved these parameters, but were accompanied by a marked increase in systemic coagulation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, the antithrombotic activity of YM-60828 after oral administration was compared with those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, cilostazol, aspirin, beraprost, ethyl icosapentate and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Test drug was orally administered to fasted rats 60 min before electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>YM-60828 at 30 mg/kg p.o., but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, cilostazol, aspirin, beraprost, ethyl icosapentate or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, significantly reduced the incidence of occlusion and improved carotid arterial patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that YM-60828 may be a promising antithrombotic agent for the treatment and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> which can be given by oral as well as intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
