<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most researchers have only investigated the incidence of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the amount of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is determined in carotid endarterectomy specimens from 33 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients that caused &gt;70% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plaque components (<z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, calcification, and intraluminal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) were quantified as a percentage of the total plaque volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high incidence of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was found in both the symptomatic (94%, 31/33) and asymptomatic (71%, 10/14) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amount of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was very small within the plaques of the symptomatic (0.39% +/- 0.70%) and asymptomatic (0.37% +/- 1.12%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plaques of the symptomatic patients contained more <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> than <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (45.62% +/- 14.99% and 20.45% +/- 21.45%, respectively), as did the plaques of the asymptomatic patients (42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>51% +/- 15.28% and 15.46% +/- 15.22%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, intraluminal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and calcification were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the amount of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was very small and therefore question its direct role in the development of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In general, the "unstable" plaque contained more <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> than <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
