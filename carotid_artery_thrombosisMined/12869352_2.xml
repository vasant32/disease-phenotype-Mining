<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Tissue factor (TF) is normally expressed at low levels in the media of blood vessels, but it is readily induced after vessel injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether vascular damage per se or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation is responsible for this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cyclic flow variations (CFVs), attributable to recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, were induced in stenotic rabbit carotid arteries with endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CFVs were observed for 30 minutes and 2, 4, and 8 hours in different groups of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another group of rabbits pretreated with hirudin before inducing arterial damage to inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was observed for 8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial sections were immunostained for TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Undamaged arteries served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In additional rabbits, in situ hybridization experiments were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No TF expression was observed in the media of control vessels, whereas a progressive increase in TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression was observed in carotid arteries as CFVs progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No increase in TF expression was observed in animals pretreated with hirudin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments demonstrated that TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is induced in smooth muscle cells stimulated with activated platelets as well as with some platelet-derived mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This phenomenon may contribute to sustain intravascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation after the initial thrombogenic stimulus </plain></SENT>
