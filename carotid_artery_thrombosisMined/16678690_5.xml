<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The series includes 2262 CEAs (335 bilateral) in 1521 men and 741 women (33%) with median ages of 66 and 68 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications were asymptomatic stenosis for 1503 procedures (66%), <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> or cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> each for 271 (12%), and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for 217 (9.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CEA was done as an isolated operation in 1959 patients and was performed in conjunction with simultaneous CABG in 303 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary arteriotomy closure was used for 783 CEAs (35%), vein patching for 1232 (54%), and synthetic patching for 247 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome event rates were assessed by logistic regression analysis, proportional hazards models, and Kaplan-Meier estimations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 7.5; P = .001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.4; P = .001), and combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality rates (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.0 to 5.8; P &lt; .001) were significantly higher for simultaneous CEA/CABG than for isolated CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were similar (2.6% vs 1.7%, P = .41) in both settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vein patching had a lower risk for ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.86; P = .015) than primary closure, but was not significantly different from synthetic patching (P = .10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The documented incidence of postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 1.5% with primary closure, 0.6% with vein patching, and 2.0% with synthetic patching (P = .088) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall Kaplan-Meier survival was 92% at 1 year, 71% at 5 years, 41% at 10 years, and 20% at 15 years, but long-term mortality rates were higher after simultaneous CEA/CABG (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.5; P = .002) than after CEA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> infarctions have been reported after 97 (5.0%) of the 1923 operations for which follow-up was available, 51 (2.3%) of which were ipsilateral to CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of &gt; or = 60% recurrent stenosis was independently influenced by carotid patching (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.92; P = .019) but not by the choice of patch material (P = .11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results substantiate the common observation that patients who require simultaneous CEA/CABG have a higher risk for adverse outcomes than patients who undergo isolated CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Carotid patching provided significant benefit with respect to the risks for ipsilateral postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and &gt; or = 60% recurrent stenosis </plain></SENT>
