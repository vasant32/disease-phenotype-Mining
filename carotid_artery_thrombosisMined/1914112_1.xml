<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although antithrombotic therapies with aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> have decreased thrombo-occlusive events, they have not abolished these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endovascular mechanical support, first reported by Dotter in 1969, has been proposed as a means to reduce both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vessel closure by providing a supporting framework for the disrupted and sometimes dissected arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the effects of placing self-expanding stainless steel wire endoprostheses on the accumulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> at sites of carotid artery endarterectomy we measured platelet deposition continuously for 90 minutes and at 24 and 48 hours by gamma camera imaging of autologous 111In-labeled platelets in six stented and nonstented endarterectomized baboons that received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> but no antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At nonstented endarterectomy sites 5.36 +/- 1.25 x 10(8), 4.78 +/- 0.98 x 10(8), and 4.55 +/- 0.81 x 10(8) platelets per cm were deposited at 30, 60, and 90 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, stented endarterectomy sites accumulated 0.99 +/- 0.31 x 10(8), 0.66 +/- 0.33 x 10(8), and 0.80 +/- 0.36 x 10(8) platelets per cm at 30 minutes (p = 0.02), 60 minutes (p = 0.004), and 90 minutes (p = 0.002), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet deposition remained reduced at 24 and 48 hours in stented endarterectomized carotid arteries (ECAs) when assessed as a ratio between net radioactivity in the endarterectomized region versus whole blood radioactivity (p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both stented and nonstented ECAs remained patent acutely, although two of six nonstented ECAs occluded by 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By comparison 11 of 14 nonstented ECAs remained patent in another group of control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Scanning electron microscopy of control and stented arteries at 30 days demonstrated equivalently confluent endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that endovascular stents reduce the thrombogenic effects of flap formation, tearing, dissection, and vasospasm in ECAs </plain></SENT>
