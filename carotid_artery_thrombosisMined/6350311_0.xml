<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We use a small focal spot x-ray tube, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30514">cesium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16382">iodide</z:chebi> image intensifier and the image is recorded on a 512 X 512 matrix at 1.2 frames per second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subtraction angiograms have been obtained in 250 patients and 86% of the results were graded as either good or excellent in head and neck examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is however a small proportion of patients in whom results are unsatisfactory and in whom this fact can be attributed most often to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The advantages of digital intravenous and intra-arterial subtraction angiography have been evaluated and amount to improved patient safety, high system contrast and favourable cost effectiveness; these outweigh the limitations of the restricted field of view and the relatively low resolution of the image in comparison with conventional arteriography </plain></SENT>
