<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the synthesis and evaluation of three new fibrin-targeted PET probes (FBP1, FBP2, FBP3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three fibrin-specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were conjugated as DOTA-monoamides at the C- and N- termini, and chelated with 64CuCl2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Probes were prepared with a specific activity ranging from 10 - 130 ÂµCi/nmol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and the probes exhibited nanomolar dissociation constants (Kd) for the soluble fibrin fragment DD(E), although the Cu-DOTA derivatization resulted in a 2-3 fold loss in affinity relative to the parent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biodistribution and imaging studies were performed in a rat model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For FBP1 and FBP2 at 120 min post injection, the vessel containing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> showed the highest concentration of radioactivity after the excretory organs liver and kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed ex vivo by autoradiography which showed &gt; 4-fold activity in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> containing artery compared to the contralateral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FBP3 showed much lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> uptake and the difference was traced to greater metabolism of this probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hybrid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-PET imaging with FBP1 or FBP2 confirmed that these probes were effective for detection of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in this rat model </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FBP1 and FBP2 represent promising new probes for the molecular imaging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
