<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the effects of varying coil caliber, length, activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> per centimeter of coil or per volume, and spatial distribution of coils on recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the angiographic evolution of 81 canine maxillary, cervical, and vertebral arteries implanted with a variety of nonradioactive (n=29 arteries) or radioactive (n=52) devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared 1- or 2-caliber 0.015 or 0.010 coils ion-implanted or not with 3 different activity levels (0.05 to 0.08, 0.06 to 0.12, 0.18 to 0.32 microCi/cm) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> and totaling 4, 8, and 16 cm in length for the same arterial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared inhibition of recanalization by beta radiation delivered by stents, after coil occlusion proximal to or within the stent, with that delivered by coils placed within nonradioactive stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We finally studied the angiographic evolution of canine lateral wall carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with 1 or 2 stents of various activity levels positioned inside the parent artery across the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed at 4 and 12 weeks for macroscopic photography and pathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> arteries (29 of 29) occluded with nonradioactive devices were recanalized, while 49 of 52 arteries (94%) implanted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> devices were occluded at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with stents, radioactive or not, demonstrated residual filling of the sac or of channels leading to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at follow-up angiography at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The recanalization process found in the canine <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> model is minimally affected by coil caliber, number, and length or packing density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Beta radiation reliably inhibits this process, but <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is an essential condition for the efficacy of a radioactive coil strategy </plain></SENT>
