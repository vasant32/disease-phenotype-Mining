<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microemboli released during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and cardiac surgery are thought to cause a variety of functional deficits in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize the type and extent of neurobehavioral deficits present after photochemically induced common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT), a thromboembolic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the rat that results in a platelet emboli shower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups 1 (n = 8) and 3 (n = 8) were long-term (6-week survival) and short-term (2-week survival) experimental groups subjected to right CCAT with the use of the photochemical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Groups 2 (n = 8) and 4 (n = 8) served as sham-operated controls for each experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A battery of behavioral tests was applied daily beginning 24 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; this consisted of elicited forelimb placing, postural reflex, beam balance, beam walking, and open field activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognitive testing with a water maze task was performed on post-CCAT days 30 to 33 for groups 1 and 2 and on post-CCAT day 2 for groups 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten-micrometer coronal brain sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location and frequency were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant sensorimotor deficits were observed, which recovered within 2 weeks after CCAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data that follow are derived by combining the two experimental groups and comparing these with the two sham groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The following tests showed significant effects after CCAT: contralateral elicited forelimb placing, ipsilateral elicited forelimb placing, beam balance, and beam walking score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive dysfunction</z:e> was seen acutely (group 3 animals) at 2 days after CCAT; <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> length and latency to target were significantly greater in the experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No deficits were seen in postural reflex, open field activity, or delayed cognitive testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Histopathological assessment revealed small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 11 of 16 thrombosed rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, a strong relationship between neurobehavioral deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location was not consistently demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CCAT produces consistent sensorimotor and cognitive behavioral deficits that recover within 2 weeks of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Behavioral outcome was not necessarily associated with overt histopathological damage, suggesting that reversible injury mechanisms, both vascular and neuronal, may be partly responsible for the temporary loss of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data strengthen the role of CCAT as a clinically relevant model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
