<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Grafts 6 cm long and 4 mm in diameter were placed in the carotid arteries of sheep and perfused for 4 hours at 25 ml/min in order to accelerate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The thrombogenicity was determined by calculation of the percent of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labelled platelet accumulation was determined in some of the grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stabilized ionic bonding of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> significantly reduced the early thrombogenicity of PU but had little effect on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> grafts; but the thrombogenicity of the latter was markedly decreased following covalent bonding of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A regional distribution of platelet accumulation was found with the distal anastomoses showing the highest platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By choice of an appropriate method of heparinization, a significant reduction of the thrombogenicity of PU and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> grafts was achieved </plain></SENT>
