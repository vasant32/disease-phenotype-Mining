<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic arch arteriography revealed appropriate internal carotid artery lesions which were amenable to endarterectomy in 36 patients (64 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of this group, abnormal Doppler findings were present in only 11 patients (31 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The definitive clinical applications of the Doppler cerebrovascular examination are limited to those settings in which demonstration of altered hemodynamics is decisive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In view of the apparent preponderance of embolic rather than hemodynamic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the Doppler examinations has only an adjunctive role in the evaluation of most patients with hemispheric symptoms of cerebrovascular occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In such patients, preselection of candidates for diagnostic arteriography is an inappropriate application of the Doppler cerebrovascular examination </plain></SENT>
