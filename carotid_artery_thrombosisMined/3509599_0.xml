<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During a study period from 1977 through 1984, 11 (0.4%) of 2651 patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy at The Cleveland Clinic had early, symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and underwent urgent reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With only two exceptions, neurologic deficits occurred after lucid intervals when the patients had recovered from general anesthesia and were discovered within the first 8 hours in three patients, within 8 to 24 hours in five patients, and on the second postoperative day in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical management consisted of thrombectomy alone in two patients, thrombectomy and vein patch angioplasty in eight patients, and thrombectomy of the external carotid artery with ligation of the ICA in a single patient in whom retrograde ICA flow could not be reestablished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight (73%) of the 11 patients recovered substantial neurologic function after reoperations, six of whom had complete or nearly complete resolution of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient (9%) sustained a fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a collected series of 41 patients from this study and other reports, prompt surgical treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurring after carotid endarterectomy was associated with clinical improvement in 61% of patients and appears to be the preferred approach to this catastrophic complication </plain></SENT>
