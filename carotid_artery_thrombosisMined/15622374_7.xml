<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to characterize molecular events related to recanalization or organization of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in a new murine model by studying genes reported to be involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> or neointima formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">Platinum</z:chebi> coils, radioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">phosphorus 32</z:chebi> coils or not, were implanted in the carotid artery in mice to cause thrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome of the occlusion was followed up with transmyocardial angiography and pathologic analysis at 2, 6, or 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic results were compared with the Pearson chi2 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">Messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF); smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA+); platelet endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (PECAM-1); vascular endothelium cadherin (VE-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Cad</z:e>); endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS); vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha); matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9, MMP-12, and MMP-14), and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs: TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, TIMP-4); angiopoietins (Ang-1, Ang-2); and receptors Tie-1 and Tie-2, were analyzed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 2, 6, and 15 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were compared with analysis of variance and the Student t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid arteries implanted with nonradioactive 0.015-caliber coils were occluded in 84% of arteries on day 2, but in only 57% of arteries on day 15, which confirms that recanalization occurred in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arteries implanted with 0.015-caliber <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> coils did not become recanalized, and 100% were occluded on day 15 (n = 13; P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was associated with endothelial-like cell-lined channels, whereas persistent occlusion was caused by complete filling of the lumen with conjunctive tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coil occlusion, with or without recanalization, was followed by decreased expression of vWf, VE-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Cad</z:e>, eNOS, VCAM-1, MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2; stable expression of PECAM-1, SMA+, and TIMP-3; and overexpression of Ang-1 and Ang-2, MMP-9, MMP-14, and TIMP-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences when arteries were implanted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> coils included decreased expression of TIMP-4 (P = .011) and increased expression of MMP-9 (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recanalization and organization of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is associated with expression of genes involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neointima formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recanalization can be prevented with beta-radiation, but molecular mechanisms remain to be refined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> has permitted its regulation as a new option in treatment of various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> may help control diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, stimulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> may palliate conditions associated with insufficient blood supply, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> or critical limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Yet little is known regarding recanalization (to be differentiated from thrombolysis), a cellular process that occurs concurrently with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> "organization." Recanalization is an important physiologic phenomenon because it can efficiently reestablish antegrade circulation after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> both in veins and in arteries, and could be modulated for therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus our efforts at better understanding of mechanisms involved in recanalization could be used, in addition to its promotion to recover flow after thrombotic occlusions, to prevent its occurrence after endovascular interventions designed to permanently occlude <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
