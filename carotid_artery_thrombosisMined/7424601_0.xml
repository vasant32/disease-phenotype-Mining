<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dog was chosen as the experimental animal because of its maxillocarotid artery which permits collateral flow round the occlusion and helps to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clot was prepared by incubating blood at room temperature to inactivate plasminogen activators and then refrigerating it to promote clot retraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Emboli persisting 48 hours were seen in 80% of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were not seen when 0.25 to 0.30 cm3 were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autoradiography and well counting revealed uptake of isotope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The test, when refined, should provide a tool for the investigation of thromboemboli </plain></SENT>
