<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety consecutive intact carotid plaques obtained from surgery and 43 carotid plaques from cadavers without symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ulceration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> were the only morphologic findings statistically correlated to the presence of hemispheric symptoms (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was more common in patients with hemispheric symptoms but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plaque causing high degree stenosis had a higher incidence of intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (p = 0.04) and ulceration (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ulceration of plaque plays a major role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hemispheric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of our study support the hypothesis that in the majority of the cases, hemispheric symptoms are embolic in nature </plain></SENT>
