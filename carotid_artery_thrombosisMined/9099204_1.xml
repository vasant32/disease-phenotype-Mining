<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in antiplatelet research led to the discovery of the platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa complex (GPIIb/IIIa), the final common pathway for platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine the oral antithrombotic efficacy of a potent and specific platelet GPIIb/ IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, DMP728, in an electrically induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the powerful antiplatelet efficacy of this mechanism in inhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation as well as in inhibiting platelet procoagulant activity (thrombin generation and hence fibrin formation), an orally active <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for this integrin receptor might have potential benefits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anesthetized dogs were instrumented for monitoring of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and carotid artery flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with saline or DMP728 (0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg PO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation (platelet-rich aggregate with fibrous coating and a few erythrocytes) by anodal electrolytic stimulation (300 microA) to the intimal surface of the right carotid artery was initiated 120 minutes after oral DMP728 administration and continued for 180 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whole blood cell counts, ex vivo platelet aggregation, and template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time were determined at different time points throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DMP728 administered at 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg PO exhibited dose-dependent antithrombotic efficacy in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DMP728 was shown to be significantly effective in inhibiting ex vivo platelet aggregation and in inhibiting <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg PO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The antiplatelet, antithrombotic effects of DMP728 were demonstrated without any significant changes in the different hemodynamic or coagulation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrated the oral antithrombotic efficacy of DMP728 in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Platelet GPIIb/IIIa blockade with an orally active <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> was shown to be safe and effective in the prevention of carotid artery occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
