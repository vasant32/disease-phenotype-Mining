<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation and release phenomena are central to most postulated mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and neointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore high-dose aspirin (HDA) has been advocated to minimize these sources of endarterectomy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have defined low-dose aspirin (LDA) that selectively blocks platelet cyclooxygenase but preserves arterial wall cyclooxygenase in the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared this theoretically optimal aspirin dose with HDA and no treatment (control) in a model of carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aspirin was started before operation and continued for 6 weeks after operation, at which time the endarterectomized vessels were excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patency and morphologic findings of the arteries were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet function was monitored by <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LDA and HDA were associated with 100% patency, whereas the control group had 50% patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, HDA did not protect the vessel from developing neointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, which was seen in the control group and was associated with platelet adherence to the flow surface at 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 6 weeks, LDA significantly decreased but did not totally prevent neointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and the flow surface was healed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore the genesis of neointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> after endarterectomy may be more complex than simply a function of platelet-vessel wall interaction </plain></SENT>
