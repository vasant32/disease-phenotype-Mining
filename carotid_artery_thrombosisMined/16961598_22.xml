<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent reports have suggested an association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To confirm whether subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT) among men and women age 65 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study (n = 4,108) without baseline clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> use or previous VT were followed for a median of 11.7 years after non-invasive assessment of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> using carotid ultrasound (intima-media thickness and presence of plaques), ankle-brachial blood pressure index and electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each event was classified as idiopathic or secondary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the relative risk of overall and idiopathic VT for individuals with and without baseline subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 133 first time VT events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> measures were associated with increased risk of overall or idiopathic VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjusted relative risks of overall and idiopathic VT for presence of any type of subclinical disease were 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.39-0.91) and 0.32 (0.18-0.59), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of this association was explained by an inverse association of high-risk carotid plaques (prevalent in 54% of those at risk) with VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-invasively measured subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was not associated with increased risk of overall or idiopathic VT in this observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaques and arterial events during follow up were inversely associated, a finding that requires further study </plain></SENT>
