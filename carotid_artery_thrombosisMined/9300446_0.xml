<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many previous reports have shown that TCD-detected microemboli may be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this study is to verify whether microemboli cease after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring was performed in 43 cases before and after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring was carried out for an hour at the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of each case using a 2-MHz pulse-wave transcranial Doppler device, and high intensity transient signals were counted as microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were detected preoperatively in 10 cases (23.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were not detected in any case immediately after CEA, in either the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage (from 14 to 21 days after CEA) or in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage (more than 3 months after CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage (from 3 to 7 days after CEA), microemboli were detected in three cases (7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of TCD-detected microembolic was always significantly reduced after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring can be helpful in assessing the effect of CEA for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by removing the suspected source of microemboli </plain></SENT>
