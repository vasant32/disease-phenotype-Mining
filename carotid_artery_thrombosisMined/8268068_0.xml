<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was initiated to evaluate the need for cerebral arteriography in the preoperative evaluation of patients for CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred five patients undergoing 114 CEA procedures are included in a retrospective review to determine whether the addition of cerebral arteriography changed the operative management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 58 of 105 patients (55%), color-flow duplex scanning and cerebral arteriography were performed in the workup prior to CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four patients a discrepancy was found between the duplex results and the arteriogram, leading to a change in the operative approach in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 47 patients (45%) underwent color-flow duplex scanning as the definitive preoperative study; the surgical management was altered because of the operative findings in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although color-flow duplex scanning does not provide absolute concordance with cerebral arteriography, in most instances it can be used as the definitive preoperative study prior to CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We define the indications for cerebral arteriography in patients undergoing CEA </plain></SENT>
