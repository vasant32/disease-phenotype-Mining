<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings obtained have revealed a correlation between the level of the compensatory collateral blood supply of the bed of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and the source of collateral blood circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors have demonstrated the vulnerability of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bed secondary to a low level of blood supply persisting despite the functioning of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathways of the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
