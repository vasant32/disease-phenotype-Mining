<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Special care must be done while performing the corticotomies to prevent injuries to blood vessels or nerves nearby </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rare iatrogenic severe injury occurred while performing this operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>REPORT OF PATIENT: A 3 year-old girl was operated upon to correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>mandibular hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A rotating saw was used to perform corticotomies in the mandibular angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the right side occurred <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and in the saw there was a piece of a blood vessel that was 15 mm long and 2 mm in diameter with an open lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exploration of the neck revealed that the most distal segment of the internal carotid artery was severed, with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the proximal end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distal segment retracted into the temporal bone without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proximal artery was ligated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After recovery she moved well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A computed tomogram was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and further condition improved clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This complication from the use of a rotary saw has not been documented previously and it must be prevented by using some protection behind the bone </plain></SENT>
