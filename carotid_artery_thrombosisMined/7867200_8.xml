<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relation between the systemic anticoagulation generated by thrombin inhibitors and their antithrombotic effect is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a guinea pig carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, the activated clotting time (ACT), the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin-generation tests were evaluated for their ability to predict the arterial antithrombotic effect of direct thrombin inhibitors such as hirudin and Ro 46-6240 compared with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the carotid artery was induced by subendothelial damage in guinea pigs, and the subsequent cyclic flow variations were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of pretreatment with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, hirudin, and Ro 46-6240 were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After doubling the baseline aPTT, 1 IU.kg-1.min-1 heparin was inactive, whereas either hirudin or Ro 46-6240 (30 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation by 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> (10 IU.kg-1.min-1) induced the same antithrombotic effect but with indefinite aPTT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, for similar prolongation of the ACT, the three compounds had equivalent antithrombotic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombin generation was predictive of the antithrombotic effect of the thrombin inhibitors but not of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The arterial antithrombotic effect of direct thrombin inhibitors, when compared with those of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, should be evaluated by the ACT and not the aPTT or thrombin-generation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For a "therapeutic" aPTT prolongation, thrombin inhibitors induce higher systemic anticoagulation than does <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and thus might unduly have higher <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> liability </plain></SENT>
