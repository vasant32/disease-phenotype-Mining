<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were treated; of these, 10 were carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 5 were vertebrobasilar territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurological status of the patients were graded according to the Glascow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale and National Institutes of Heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a CT examination on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 4 patients had diffusion-weighted and one patient had a perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients of carotid territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were treated within 6 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no time limitation for the basilar artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Rankin Scale (RS) was used as outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of the 10 patients with carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had carotid territory occlusions, 8 had middle cerebral artery main trunk occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients had symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>; of these, 3 died within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the third month 4 patients had a good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 5 patients with basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 4 had basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the basilar artery was open but the flow of the contrast material was very slow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients with unsuccessful recanalization due to underlying high grade atherosclerotic stenosis and one patient with successful recanalization died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the third month, the other patient with succesful recanalization had a poor outcome (RS 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patient with slow basilar artery flow developed from RS 5 to RS 1 and was discharged without any neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, local IA thrombolysis is a safe and feasible treatment when the right patient is selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> does not exceed that which occurs in the natural history of the disease and with other treatment methods </plain></SENT>
