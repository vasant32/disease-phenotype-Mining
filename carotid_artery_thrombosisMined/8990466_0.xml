<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Embolism from a stenotic lesion of the extracranial internal carotid artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e>) is considered to be an important pathomechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to estimate the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> associated with microembolism in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> and thereby to determine the importance of TCD-detected microemboli in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one cases with more than 30% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> and 10 cases without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring was carried out for an hour at the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of each case using a 2-MHz pulse-wave transcranial Doppler device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High intensity transient signals were counted as microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were detected in 27 of 71 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e>, but not in cases without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were detected more frequently in cases with 70% to 99% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> (53.3%) compared with in cases with 30% to 69% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarctions</z:e> were recognized in the ipsilateral hemisphere in 23 of 27 cases with microemboli (85.2%) by means of MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> were recognized only in 21 of 45 cases without microemboli (47.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a stenotic lesion of the extracranial internal carotid artery, especially high-grade stenosis, is a major source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and that detection of microemboli by TCD is a useful tool capable of reliably assessing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
