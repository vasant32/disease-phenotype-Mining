<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A library of 72 peptides consisting of d and/or synthetic amino acids was designed with various substitutions in positions 1 to 5 in Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe (RPPGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two compounds, rOicPGF (TH146) and betaAK2K-4(rOicPGF) (MAP4-TH146), were characterized further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TH146 or MAP4-TH146 completely inhibits threshold gamma-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation at a concentration of 142 +/- 0.05 or 19 +/- 0.06 microM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TH146 completely inhibits threshold alpha-thrombin-induced washed platelet aggregation at 444 +/- 0.04 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TH146 or MAP4-TH146 blocks 2 nM alpha-thrombin-induced fibroblast calcium mobilization with an IC(50) value of 110 or 18 microM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significant prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, or thrombin clotting time occurs at 31, 62, or 7.8 microM TH146 and 0.4, 6.25, or 1.56 microM MAP4-TH146, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TH146 and MAP4-TH146 inhibit both alpha-thrombin with a K(i) value of 97 and 49 microM, respectively, and factor VIIa with a K(i) value of 44 and 5 microM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both TH146 and MAP4-TH146 specifically bind to the exodomain of recombinant PAR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAP4-TH146 (200 microM) completely blocks <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">thrombocytin</z:chebi>, a PAR1-activating snake venom protease, without inhibiting the enzyme's active site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TH146 inhibits gamma-thrombin-induced aggregation of mouse platelets, prolongs mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times, and delays the time to mouse carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TH146 and MAP4-TH146 inhibit human and mouse platelet aggregation and mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analogs of RPPGF are model compounds to develop PAR1 activation <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> as well as direct inhibitors to thrombin and factor VIIa </plain></SENT>
