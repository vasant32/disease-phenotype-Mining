<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained before, during, and after occlusion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> by means of a balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doppler examination of the periorbital vessels and the carotid arteries in the neck region (selective for the common, internal, and external carotid arteries) allows a reliable and atraumatic evaluation of the carotid circulation and the pathologic venous drainage of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> by the orbital veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proper positioning of the balloon therefore is facilitated by simultaneous Doppler recording of the pathologic venous flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The balloon-catheter technique described by Prolo et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(1971) was modified and lead to a complete occlusion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> without causing a carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
