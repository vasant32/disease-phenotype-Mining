<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Color duplex sonography is useful for assessing blood flow in these vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of retrograde flow in an internal carotid artery (ICA) with an occluded ipsilateral CCA identified using color duplex sonography in a 70-year-old man with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and known atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Color duplex sonography revealed that the right CCA was totally occluded near its origin and that flow was re-established at the bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow in the right ICA was directed cephalad, with a low-frequency, damped waveform; flow in the right external carotid artery (ECA) was bidirectional, with increased reversed diastolic flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were also found in the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endarterectomy of the left carotid bifurcation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up color duplex sonography 3 months later revealed a small increase of stenosis in the left CCA and mild stenosis in the left ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The right CCA remained occluded, but reversed flow with a high-resistance flow pattern was seen in the ipsilateral ICA that supplied the ECA, which had cephalad-directed flow </plain></SENT>
