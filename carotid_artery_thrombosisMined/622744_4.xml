<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These ocular changes have been presumed to be manifestations of ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors have recently encountered this sign in seven patients and in none was there evidence of ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to an ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, arteriograms demonstrated that the major source of blood supply to the homolateral cerebral hemisphere was by retrograde flow through markedly enlarged ophthalmic arteries filled in retrograde fashion from dilated external carotid collateral channels in the orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association of dilated episcleral arteries as a sign of increased orbital blood flow and the major source of collateral blood supply to the homolateral cerebral hemisphere has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reemphasize the importance of a careful examination of the episcleral vessels in patients suspected of having internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
