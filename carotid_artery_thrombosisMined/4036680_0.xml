<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study this problem, three different needles were tested on the exposed carotid arteries of 30 rats: the 100 mu taper point, the 100 mu cutting point, and the 75 mu taper point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trauma generated by the penetration of needles was tested first as the needle and its attached suture was passed through the vessel, then the suture was left in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hour after penetration, the arteries were prepared for scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences between the 100 mu taper point and the 75 mu taper point were significant in terms of size and extent of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An arc of endothelial cells surrounding the wounds showed flattening, tissue destruction and clotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To minimize endothelial trauma, taper point needles are superior to cutting needles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 100 mu cutting needle caused damage to the vessel wall in tissue cutting on needle penetration, causing a slit-like incision, and in aggregation of platelets at the puncture site </plain></SENT>
