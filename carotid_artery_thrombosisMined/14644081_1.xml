<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In the rat model of topical <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a transient blood flow velocity (VEL) increase is observed immediately following <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immediacy of the response suggested vasoconstriction, as thrombotic narrowing of the vessel lumen was hypothesized to be too slow to account for the rapidity of the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To explore this phenomenon, the effects of two mechanistically distinct <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) and hydralazine (HYD), on velocity increase, ex vivo platelet aggregation and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, were assessed in the rat <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">Sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (10, 30 and 50 microg/kg/min i.v.) and hydralazine (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg/min i.v.) reduced the mean arterial pressure with the higher dose regimens eliciting equivalent hypotensive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> and hydralazine blunted the initial velocity increase, but only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> significantly reduced the incidence of thrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in ex vivo platelet aggregation responses to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>), collagen (COLL) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) were observed between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> and hydralazine treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, platelet aggregation response to thrombin was significantly reduced in the 50 microg/kg/min i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> compared to the 1.0 mg/kg/min i.v. hydralazine and vehicle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of the initial velocity increase by two mechanistically distinct <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, and the dissociation between this velocity change and antithrombotic efficacy, support the hypothesis that the early velocity increase results from a change in vascular tone rather than due to enhanced platelet activation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet activation may contribute to the antithrombotic actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> in this preparation </plain></SENT>
