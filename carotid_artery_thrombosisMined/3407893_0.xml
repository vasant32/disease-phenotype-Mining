<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Premedication (pethidine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi>) and induction of anesthesia were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (by HPLC/<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>), ADH, ACTH, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> (by RIA), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and free <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> were determined before and after induction of anesthesia, 7 times during the operation, and 30 min after extubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAP and HR were measured continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical evaluation was undertaken by analysis of variance with repeated measures on 1 factor, considering P values of less than 0.05 as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> parameters failed to show any remarkable increase during the entire operation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the end of the operation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hormones rose significantly (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and increases in MAP and HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and ADH were higher in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> group (P less than 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that cardiovascular reactions during carotid endarterectomy are not caused by systemic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuroleptanesthesia leads to better stress protection in the postoperative period, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia has some advantages for the intraoperative control of arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
