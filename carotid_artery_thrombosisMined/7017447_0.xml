<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2) Removal of atheroma plaque en block, as far as possible, shortened the operation time and diminished the arterial wall damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3) We could approach to the carotid artery without dissection of the common facial vein by antero-medial retraction of the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4) The operation without internal shunt made the technique simple and shortened the operation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5) Interlacing vascular suture with microsurgical technique prevented narrowing or shortening of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>6) We used a pair of small needle holders with teeth for anterior wall suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could pick up the adventitia easily and exactly, and did not need change of the needle holding with these instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>7) Others: The clamping time ranged 15-45 minutes without any neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
