<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi>, Z<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>-Glu (Ot-Bu) Ala-Leucinal (PSI), is active in the prevention of platelet-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> induced in renovascular hypertensive rats (two-kidney, one clip <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1398850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Goldblatt</z:e> model, and 2K1C, n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The administration of PSI intravenously at a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg before induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> markedly increased carotid final flow rate, as compared to control (vehicle) group (10.36 +/- 1.8 ml/min and 1.2 +/- 1.2 ml/min, respectively), significantly decreased the wet (1.23 +/- 0.23 mg and 4.1 +/- 0.94 mg, respectively), and dry (0.46 +/- 0.145 mg and 1.46 +/- 0.39, respectively) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight, and completely prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, platelets from PSI - treated thrombotic 2K1C rats, showed in response to collagen a significant inhibition of aggregation in the whole blood (10.26 +/- 0.6 ohms vs. 15.51 +/- 0.91 ohms in the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, collagen-induced platelet aggregation was not inhibited in vitro, after pre-treatment of the blood with PSI at the concentration of 10 microM that effectively inhibited the 20S proteasome activity in platelets, indicating that ex vivo anti-aggregatory effect of PSI proceeds through an indirect mechanism not associated with suppression of 20S proteasome activity in platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our in vivo findings demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi>, Z<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>-Glu(Ot-Bu)Ala-Leucinal, prevents the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in renovascular hypertensive rats and effectively suppresses platelet aggregation by an indirect mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the data provide a new insight into the potential role for the proteasome-dependent pathway in cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
