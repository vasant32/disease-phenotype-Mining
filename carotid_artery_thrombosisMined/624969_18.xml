<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immediately after flow was established, a fibrinplatelet carpet formed on the endarterectomized surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formed on this initial layer resulting in vessel occlusion in 52% of non-heparinized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 48 hours after surgery, there was little evidence of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and reendothelialization from existing endothelial cells was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week later, most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> had disappeared and re-endothelialization was well underway; by 3 months after surgery, re-endothelialization was complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative heparinization resulted in a striking reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation and 100% patency rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vessel closure with vein-patch grafts resulted in no improvement of vessel patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the results of this aspect of the study cannot be totally extrapolated to human carotid endarterectomy for the reasons discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival of the vein-patch grafts was investigated </plain></SENT>
