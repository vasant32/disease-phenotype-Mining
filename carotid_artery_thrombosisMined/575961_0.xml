<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dissection and anastomosis damage the endothelia of the arteries and veins and expose collagen in the subendothelial layers of these vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 1 hr of the introduction of blood flow through the grafts, deposits of fibrin and platelets led to blockage of the grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 rats, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was given intravenously about 0.5 hr before completion of the grafting procedure; <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was also used to wash out the veins for grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 11 rats, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was used only to wash out the veins for grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At periods 1-11 weeks later, the grafts were reexamined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were patent except 1 from the first group, examined at 7 weeks, and 1 from the second group, examined at 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scanning electron microscopy showed that complete healing of the venous endothelium took several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was equally effective in keeping the grafts patent when given intravenously and used locally or when only used locally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study indicates, therefore, that long-term patency in small diameter vein grafts can be achieved merely by washing out the veins for grafting with a solution of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
