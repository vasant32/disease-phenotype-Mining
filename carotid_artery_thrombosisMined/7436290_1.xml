<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over 700 cerebral vascular operations have been undertaken on the Surgical Unit of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis, the majority being carotid endarterectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the unique features of the latter procedure is the marked instability of postoperative blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relation of this change to interference with carotid baroreceptor function was studied by per-operative carotid sinus nerve recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was possible to relate nerve activity to the postend-arterectomy changes in the mechanical properties of the vessel wall in the region of the carotid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypotensive episodes</z:e> could be reversed by the injection of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anaesthetic</z:chebi> alongside the carotid sinus nerve through a cannula left in situ at operation.The complications of 425 carotid endarterectomies were analysed by computer and specific risk factors were found to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the presence of contralateral internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, and the presence of lower limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The carotid angiograms of 200 patients were studied with respect to the extent of the disease at the origin of the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operative complication rate was found to be closely related to the severity of this disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> severe complications occurring in patients with severe bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding has led to the introduction of the term the ;reperfusion syndrome', and the mechanism of the complication is still under study.Seventy-nine extraintracranial revascularising procedures have been undertaken and this operation has been shown to carry a very low morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative incidence of recurrent transitory ischaemic attacks (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> is low, but the longest follow-up period is still only 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The value of the procedure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> is under study, as is its place in the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
