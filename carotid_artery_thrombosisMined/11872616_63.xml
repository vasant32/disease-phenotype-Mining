<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence or degree of haemodynamic impairment due to occlusive cerebrovascular disease is often inferred from measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and the cerebral rate for oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship of these variables, in particular CBV, to regional cerebral haemodynamics is not clearly established in humans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the relationship of CBV to OEF, CBF and CMRO2, and to subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, in order to define better the associated haemodynamic and metabolic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed data from 81 patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion enrolled in a prospective study of haemodynamic factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of CBV, CBF, OEF and CMRO2 were made on entry using PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into groups by hemispheric ratios and absolute ipsilateral values of OEF and CBV, based on comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic and metabolic values, risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on hemispheric ratios, 45 patients had increased ipsilateral OEF; CBV was increased in 19 of these 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in CBF, CMRO2 or clinical risk factors were found between these 19 patients and the remaining 26 patients with increased OEF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or reduced CBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred during follow-up, and 10 of the 13 occurred in the 19 patients with increased OEF and CBV (log rank P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of the 68 patients with complete quantitative PET data had increased OEF by absolute ipsilateral values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CBV was increased in 20 of the 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No differences in CBF, CMRO2 or clinical risk factors were found between these 20 patients and the remaining 12 patients with increased OEF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven of the nine ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that occurred in the 68 patients occurred in those 20 patients with increased OEF and increased CBV (log rank P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The higher risk of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with increased OEF and CBV suggests that their degree of haemodynamic compromise is more severe than those with increased OEF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> carotid occlusion and increased OEF, increased CBV may indicate pronounced vasodilation due to exhausted autoregulatory vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The physiological explanation for the measurement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBV in patients with increased OEF is less certain and may reflect preserved autoregulatory capacity </plain></SENT>
