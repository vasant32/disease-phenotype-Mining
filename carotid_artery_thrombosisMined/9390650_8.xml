<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of particular therapeutic interest are those substances that facilitate vasodilation and the clearance of platelet aggregates in the compromised microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A likely contributor to these functions is nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> because it is known to inhibit platelet aggregability and promote vascular relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the involvement of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in the hemodynamic changes after experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, photochemically induced nonocclusive common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CCAT is a rat model of unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and platelet embolization to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study characterized the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic consequences of CCAT and the resultant pattern of platelet deposits with and without nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibition by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> local cerebral blood flow changes were studied at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right CCAT was produced in 30 male Wistar rats injected with (111)In-labeled platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between 5 and 15 minutes after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, rats were treated with either 15 mg/kg of L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> (intravenously) or saline vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic changes were studied 30 to 45 minutes after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight coronal levels were analyzed, and cortical and subcortical regions of interest were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant increases were observed in total platelets in the ipsilateral hemisphere after L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> treatment, and in the distribution of platelets in the anterior frontal and occipital cortices with nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibition, encompassing the anterior and posterior border zone areas of the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, foci of labeled platelets were detected throughout the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean local cerebral blood flow images (n = 5) revealed a moderate bilateral global reduction in flow acutely, which normalized in the untreated thrombosed group by 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>-treated groups (sham and experimental) had lasting, widespread reductions in flow of approximately 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pairwise comparisons between groups showed that CCAT/L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> was significantly different from shams in the corpus callosum and different from L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> shams in the internal capsule (P &lt; 0.05) These hemodynamic and platelet accumulation changes may partially account for the aggravation of cognitive and sensorimotor deficits previously reported in this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
