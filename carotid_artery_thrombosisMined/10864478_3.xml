<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study compares vascular closure staples (VCSs) with conventional sutures in the rabbit carotid vein graft model to determine whether anastomotic technique affects cellular proliferation, blood velocity, or intimal changes when measured over a period of 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.0-3.2 kg underwent interposition of jugular vein grafts in left carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Half of the animals had anastomoses performed with small VCSs (n = 13) and half had anastomoses performed with 8-O interrupted <z:chebi fb="80" ids="53550">polypropylene</z:chebi> suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were allowed to survive for 1 week (n = 4, VCS; n = 4, suture), 2 weeks (n = 4, VCS; n = 4, suture), and 3 months (n = 5, VCS; n = 5, suture) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the distal anastomosis was measured after completion of the graft and again at sacrifice in the 3-month survival groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At sacrifice, sections were taken from the middle and distal end of the vein graft and the distal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular cell proliferation was measured using 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine labeling and intimal changes were measured using digitized microscopic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 26 grafts were open at the time of sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PSV at the distal clipped anastomosis was 40.52 cm/s (t = 0) and 34.3 cm/s (t = 3 months, P = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PSV at the distal sutured anastomosis was 38.30 cm/s (t = 0) and 39.23 cm/s (t = 3 months, P = 0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the two techniques at either t = 0 or t = 3 months (P = 0.51 and P = 0.31, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cell proliferation and smooth muscle cell proliferation at the anastomosis was highest during the 2 weeks after the procedure, then returned to baseline levels by 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But there was no significant difference between the clipped and sutured groups with respect to vascular cell proliferation postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The intimal thickness changed significantly in the vein graft at the anastomosis for both the clipped and sutured groups (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>But there was no difference when the intimal changes for each technique were compared (P = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No differences were observed when peak systolic velocity, vascular cell proliferation, and intimal changes were compared between sutured and stapled anastomoses in rabbit vein interposition grafts over a period of 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
