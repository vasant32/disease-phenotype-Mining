<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Continuous use of oral anticontraceptive agents has been related to adverse vascular changes in the form of venous or arterial thromboses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our case, we describe a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> due to occlusion of the common carotid artery after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> massive overdose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> due to error of dosage when using Yuzpe's system or emergency post-coital therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: We describe a 26 year old woman with no previous clinical history, who smoked 20 cigarettes per day, did not take oral contraceptive pills and suffered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left facial-brachial-crural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> together with reduced level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging tests showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the right common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Etiological study of the patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accident</z:e> was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only etiopathogenic factor to be related was having taken oral contraceptive agents for three days after coitus as emergency post-coital treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This treatment was incorrect, since the dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> was four times that recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The continued use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi>, especially at doses over 30 micrograms per day, was considered responsible for approximately 10% of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi> in young people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accident</z:e> is greater when there is associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and/or smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient who showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> use of high doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> may also cause <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, in this case in the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
