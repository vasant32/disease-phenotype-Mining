<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technical efficacy of fibrinolysis, defined as the clot volume lysed per unit time, was found to be optimal with r-tissue plasminogen activator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) activated lys-plasminogen (= plasmin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to carotid artery territory occlusion were treated by local intraarterial fibrinolysis using the plasmin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angiographic data and clinical outcome of these patients were compared with those of 40 patients who received plasminogen activators (urokinase or r-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory and clinical data confirmed that plasmin lysis is superior to treatment using only plasminogen activators </plain></SENT>
