<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the effects of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in an experimental model of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Folts model was used in 60 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After anesthesia, the carotid artery was exposed and a 75% stenosis was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A compression injury of the artery triggered a series of cyclic flow reductions (CFRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After counting baseline CFRs, animals were assigned randomly to one of four groups (n = 15 in each): control, PRP, rFVIIa and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control animals received 10 mL.kg(-1) of saline while 10 mL.kg(-1) of a hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> solution (200,000/6%/0.5) were infused in the three other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CFRs were measured again, followed by treatment with PRP, rFVIIa or placebo and by a final measurement of CFRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of each observation period, an ear immersion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time (BT) was measured and a blood sample was drawn for the evaluation of hematological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was evaluated at the end of the experiment in grams of blood shed from liver and spleen sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results are presented as median (range) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rFVIIa shortened the BT and decreased microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as compared with placebo [60 (35-100) sec vs 110 (50-140) sec, P = 0.0019 and 9 (4-24) g vs 17 (5-28) g, P = 0.002, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>rFVIIa did not increase CFRs [3(0-9) vs |(0-5), P = 0.11] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: rFVIIa led to a decrease in BT and microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> but did not significantly affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
