<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The decision to patch was made at the surgeon's discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general a patch was used for small arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the primary closure group 32 patients (2.7%) had a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in the patch angioplasty group 17 (3.4%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference (2.7% vs. 3.4%) was not significant (p &lt; 0.5275, Fisher's exact two-tailed test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 240 arteries were closed with a vein patch and 11 (4.6%) of these patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 266 were closed with a synthetic patch (Dacron, 211; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi>, 55) and six of the patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (2.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate between the vein and synthetic patch groups (4.6% vs. 2.3%) was not significant (p &lt; 0.2159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patch angioplasty cannot be shown to reduce the incidence of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late carotid patency was not studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study supports a policy of selective patch angioplasty based on arterial size rather than patching <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When a patch is used, we prefer filamentous Dacron as the patch material </plain></SENT>
