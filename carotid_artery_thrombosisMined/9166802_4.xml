<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to determine whether ultrasonic tissue characterization could detect carotid plaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were examined preoperatively and the ultrasonic tissue characterization findings were compared to those of optical microscopy of the removed plaque specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten of 15 patients studied had plaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultra-ultrasonic tissue characterization entailed an analysis of parameters obtained from the power spectrum of backscattered ultrasound signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained with a nominal 10 MHz sector scanning transducer with an effective bandwidth of 3 to 13 MHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The parameters were the slope and intercept derived from the linear regression of the normalized spectrum and total power (log of the integrated power of the normalized spectrum over the effective bandwidth) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined effect of the three parameters was determined by discriminant function analysis and showed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) between nonthrombus and plaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in a small sample of patients with advance carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These parameters applied singly could not provide such a distinction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correct classification of carotid plaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> using the multiple-parameter analysis revealed a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 80%, and accuracy of 86.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that analysis utilizing a combination of multiple spectral parameters was able to detect carotid plaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
