<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and neurological deficits appeared in rat focal cerebral ischemic models, and the degree was of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> larger in occlusion model than in thrombogenesis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly smaller and neurological deficits greatly improved at large dose of EGb(200 mg.kg-1, i.v.), the preventive effect appeared to be better than the treatment effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The positive control drugs urokinase and nimodipine were also shown to distinctly decrease the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improve the neurological deficits in the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small dose of EGb(100 mg.kg-1, i.v.) was found to decrease the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size of thrombogenesis model, and improve neurological deficits of both thrombogenesis and occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGb was also shown to inhibit the thrombogensis of rat common carotid artery stimulated by electrical current in dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This experiment indicates that EGb might have beneficial effects on prevention and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
