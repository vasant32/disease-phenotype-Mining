<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For several decades it has been recognized that the alpha-subunit of GP (GPIbalpha) also binds thrombin but the physiological relevance, if any, of this interaction was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that a sulfated tyrosine 276 (Tyr276) is essential for thrombin binding to GPIbalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the in vivo relevance of GPIbalpha residue Tyr276 in hemostasis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>.Methods: Transgenic mouse colonies expressing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human GPIbalpha subunit or a mutant human GPIbalpha containing a Phe substitution for Tyr276 (hTg(Y276F)) were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both colonies were bred to mice devoid of murine GPIbalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surface-expressed GPIbalpha levels and platelet counts were similar in both colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>hTg(Y276F) platelets were significantly impaired in binding alpha-thrombin but displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> binding to type I fibrillar collagen and human VWF in the presence of ristocetin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In models of laser-induced injury, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> developing in hTg(Y276F) animals were also less stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that GPIbalpha residue Tyr276 is physiologically important, supporting stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo </plain></SENT>
