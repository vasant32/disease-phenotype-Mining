<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and with a visible cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on computed tomographic scan, due to cervical dissection and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal carotid artery, were studied with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography in order to assess the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), the regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) and the regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) in different regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rCBF and rCMRO2 were only decreased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area but not in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone or elsewhere in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As rOEF was not increased in the affected cerebral hemisphere, the present study suggests artery-to-artery embolism rather than a haemodynamic event as the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> thus appears to be the appropriate treatment in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
