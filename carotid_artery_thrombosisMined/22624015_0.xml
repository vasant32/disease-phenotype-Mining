<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several anthocyanin compounds have been reported to be protective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e>), the direct effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35218,38697">anthocyanins</z:chebi> on platelets, the key players in atherothrombosis, has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The roles of Dp-3-g in platelet function are completely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effects of Dp-3-g on platelet activation and several <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that Dp-3-g significantly inhibited human and murine platelet aggregation in both platelet-rich plasma and purified platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also markedly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> growth in human and murine blood in perfusion chambers at both low and high shear rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using intravital microscopy, we observed that Dp-3-g decreased platelet deposition, destabilized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, and prolonged the time required for vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dp-3-g also significantly inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> growth in a carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanisms, we examined platelet activation markers via flow cytometry and found that Dp-3-g significantly inhibited the expression of P-selectin, CD63, CD40L, which reflect platelet α- and δ-granule release, and cytosol protein secretion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that Dp-3-g downregulated the expression of active integrin αIIbβ3 on platelets, and attenuated fibrinogen binding to platelets following <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> treatment, without interfering with the direct interaction between fibrinogen and integrin αIIbβ3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found that Dp-3-g reduced phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate-activated protein kinase, which may contribute to the observed inhibitory effects on platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, Dp-3-g significantly inhibits platelet activation and attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> growth at both arterial and venous shear stresses, which likely contributes to its protective roles against <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
