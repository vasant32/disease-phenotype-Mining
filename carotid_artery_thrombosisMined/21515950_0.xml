<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endovascular intervention was performed in 10 of 751 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to our institution between April 2001 and July 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications were: presentation within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score ≥ 10 on admission; absence of extensive signal hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging; and carotid T occlusion on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Localized intra-arterial thrombolysis using urokinase and/or mechanical clot disruption using micro-balloon catheter were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiographic findings, ΔNIHSS defined as NIHSS on day 7 - NIHSS on admission, 3-month modified Rankin scale (mRS), 3-month mortality, and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial recanalization was achieved in 5 of 10 patients, but no recanalization was obtained in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in 3-month mRS (0-2) or symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> were identified between these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the partial recanalization group showed significantly better clinical outcomes (median 3-month mRS 3 vs. 6, p = 0.009) and lower mortality rate at 90 days (0% vs. 80%, p = 0.047) with significantly greater ΔNIHSS (-8 vs. +6, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascular intervention based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging resulting in partial recanalization may reduce poor outcomes and mortality in patients with embolic carotid T occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement of the outcomes of such patients requires more efficient methods such as clot retrieval therapy </plain></SENT>
