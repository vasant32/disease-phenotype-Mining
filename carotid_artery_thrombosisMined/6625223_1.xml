<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the sensitivity of the test exceeds 90%, the method has a lower specificity which ranges between 8 and 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The poor specificity is due to the difficulty in distinguishing flow disturbances normally present at the carotid bifurcation from those produced by minimal amount of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to improve the ability of the method to predict normalcy, new features measured from the low common carotid waveform are evaluated on 150 sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference of frequency from the systolic peak (a) to the point of first zero slope after peak systole (b) was used to define the ratio (a-b)/a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A ratio greater than 0.5 was associated with 76% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sides and only 7% of the diseased sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A ratio below 0.5 was associated with 83% of the diseased sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This ratio, when used alone, can improve the specificity of the method to 76% </plain></SENT>
