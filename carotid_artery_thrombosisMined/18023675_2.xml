<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Sutureless anastomoses for coronary artery surgery are being investigated for a minimally invasive setup because they are easy to perform and less time-consuming than are sutured anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The short-term effects of the biocompatible adhesive BioGlue on vascular tissue have been described as potentially unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the medium-term macroscopic and histologic effects associated with the use of BioGlue on rabbit carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four carotid arteries of 17 New Zealand White rabbits were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine carotid arteries were left unmanipulated and free of glue, 9 carotid arteries had BioGlue applied as a control, and 16 carotid arteries were transected and reanastomosed with the aid of BioGlue and an endovascular balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 16 transected arteries, 4 had to be excluded from further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic scanning was performed 60 days postsurgery, after which the animals were euthanized and tissue samples were obtained for macroscopic and histologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The application of BioGlue resulted in a marked invasion of inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The glue partially degraded and was replaced with connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Obvious calcification of the arterial wall and the capsule that had formed around the glue was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stenoses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, and pseudoaneurysms were predominantly noted in the glued anastomosis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study raise concerns about the safety of BioGlue in coronary artery surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In light of our results, the use of BioGlue in large-vessel vascular surgery should be considered with great care for each individual patient </plain></SENT>
