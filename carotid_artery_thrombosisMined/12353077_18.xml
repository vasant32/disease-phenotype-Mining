<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This overall system functions in anticoagulation, profibrinolytic, and antiinflammatory responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice with a severe targeted deficiency of this receptor have been generated by integration of exogenous DNA elements into the 5'-untranslated region of the EPCR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the retention of the entire endogenous EPCR coding sequence in the altered EPCR gene locus, only very low EPCR message contents were detected in mice by quantitative RT-PCR during embryogenesis and up to at least early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of various regions of the arterial tree of mice up to 4 months of age, employing an anti-murine EPCR antibody, confirmed that undetectable levels of this protein were present in arterial regions during these periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, these mice are not more prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> after challenge in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small amounts (&lt;10% of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>) of this protein were found in other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Matings of mice homozygous for this deficiency led to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> births and survival of the offspring, in contrast to results by others demonstrating early <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> of a total EPCR deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data further show that minimal levels of EPCR are able to support male and female virility, as well as embryonic development, birth, and survival to adulthood </plain></SENT>
