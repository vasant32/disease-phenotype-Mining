<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigations were done in 110 patients with symptoms of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_105'>circulatory disorders</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 45 patients carotid arteriography was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 30 cases arterial reconstructive operations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The curves of blood flow velocity in the common carotid arteries were recorded with a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-10 ultrasound blood flow detector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The obtained curves were subjected to morphological analysis and the mean momentary velocity of the systolic and diastolic flow wave was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 80% of cases with impaired patency of the carotid arteries demonstrated by angiography abnormal curves of blood flow velocity in the common carotid arteries were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method of ultrasound recording of blood flow velocity is non-invasive and safe and it is very useful for establishing indications to angiography and for postoperative control </plain></SENT>
