<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this controversial climate, we feel that three important points should be underlined: the American studies, however reliable they may be, have been conducted with conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> and the generalisation to the results of other types of hormones such as those prescribed in Europe is perhaps a little hasty; other factors of risk should be taken into consideration in the eventual potentialisation of the risk induced by such treatment; the venous and arterial vascular risks are not based on the same physiopathological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence the increased risk in one or the other network system should perhaps not be amalgamated either </plain></SENT>
