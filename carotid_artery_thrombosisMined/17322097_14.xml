<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic anticoagulation is widely used, but limitations in efficacy and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications cause an ongoing search for new agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, with new agents developed it seems to be an inherent problem that increased efficiency is accompanied by an increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigate whether targeting of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> to activated platelets provides a means to overcome this association of potency and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS) on fibrinogen/fibrin-binding GPIIb/IIIa represent an abundant clot-specific target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We cloned an anti-LIBS single-chain antibody (scFv(anti-LIBS)) and genetically fused it with a potent, direct factor Xa (fXa) inhibitor, tick <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (TAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific antibody binding of fusion molecule scFv(anti-LIBS)-TAP was proven in flow cytometry; anti-fXa activity was demonstrated in chromogenic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo anticoagulative efficiency was determined by Doppler-flow in a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ScFv(anti-LIBS)-TAP prolonged occlusion time comparable to enoxaparine, recombinant TAP, and nontargeted mutant-scFv-TAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ScFv(anti-LIBS)-TAP revealed antithrombotic effects at low doses at which the nontargeted mutant-scFv-TAP failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> tested, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times were not prolonged by scFv(anti-LIBS)-TAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The novel clot-targeting approach of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> via single-chain antibody directed against a LIBS-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on GPIIb/IIIa promises effective anticoagulation with reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
