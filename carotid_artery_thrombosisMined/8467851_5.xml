<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The carotid occlusion was secondary to subendothelial fibrous tissue proliferation which was associated with a considerable mononuclear cell infiltration of the carotid wall, characterised as T cells by immunoperoxidase methods </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e>-like disease in our patient involved a T-cell-mediated attack to a vascular antigen </plain></SENT>
