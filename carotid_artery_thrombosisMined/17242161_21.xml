<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) enhances aggregation of platelets submaximally stimulated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This results from activation of EP3, one of the four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> receptors, which decreases the threshold at which <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> activate platelets to aggregate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> induced by administration of AA, its role in pathophysiopathological conditions has remained speculative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that arterial walls subjected to inflammatory stimuli produce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In several models, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> produced by the arterial wall facilitates <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next, we detected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> in mouse atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that this plaque-produced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> is not altered and is still able to activate EP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we present evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> can leave the plaque and activate EP3 on blood platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these findings, we observed that atherothrombosis induced in vivo by mechanical rupture of the plaque was drastically decreased when platelets lacked EP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> facilitates the initiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and, hence, contributes to atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the platelet EP3 receptor should improve prevention of atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
