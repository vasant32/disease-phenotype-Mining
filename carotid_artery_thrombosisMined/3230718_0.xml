<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The choroidal blood flow (ChBF) decreased significantly to about 75% for 60 minutes after the ipsilateral ligation of the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 11 of the rabbits ChBF was measured both one and six weeks after ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ChBF recovered to 88% of the resting level one week after the ligation, and returned to the resting values six weeks after the ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The left carotid artery was ligated six weeks after ligation of the right carotid artery, and there was not any significant change in the ChBF of the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It seemed that the recovery of the ChBF of the right eye was not through the contralateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
