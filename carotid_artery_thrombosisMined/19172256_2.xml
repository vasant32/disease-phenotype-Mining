<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the role of multidetector three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D CTA) for evaluating both the residual arterial lumen and the sequential change in the intraluminal diameter and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation following carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients consisting of 23 successfully stented carotid arteries were examined by 3D CTA with volume-rendering at 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks and 6, 12 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The eccentric in-stent hypodense area could be detected in ten of 23 (43.5%) carotid arteries at 2 weeks of follow-up, and they then gradually declined until they almost disappeared at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eccentric in-stent hypodense areas in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (up to 12 weeks after CAS) were found in nine out of 16 carotid arteries with longer stents (3 or 4 cm in size) deployed across the carotid bifurcation, whereas no eccentric in-stent hypodense area could be observed in the patients with a short stent (2 cm) deployed only to the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of the ten observed eccentric hypodense areas presented on the dorsal surface at the carotid bifurcation level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid 3D CTA for evaluating residual lumen and in-stent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation after CAS is considered to be a useful diagnostic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To avoid stent occlusion, both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phases following CAS (up to 12 weeks) call for the administration of appropriate anti-platelet therapy and careful observations of the patients </plain></SENT>
