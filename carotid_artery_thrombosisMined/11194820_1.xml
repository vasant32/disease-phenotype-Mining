<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To develop a porcine carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model using a novel stent-graft device to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy and angioplasty procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An endovascular device made from a tapered <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> graft inverted in a self-expanding nitinol stent was delivered to bilateral carotid arteries via a right femoral approach in 16 pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid thrombotic occlusion ensued from flow stasis created by the intrastent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Via selective carotid catheterization from a femoral approach, urokinase (250,000 IU) was pulse-sprayed in one carotid artery while a control saline solution was infused in the contralateral vessel; delivery times were 1 hour, 8 hours, 3 days, or 6 days after carotid occlusion (4 animals per time period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty was performed to maintain carotid patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arteriography and intravascular ultrasound were used to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy was used for histological analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred in 15+/-8 minutes after stent-graft placement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urokinase was effective in recanalizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occluded arteries in the 1-hour, 4-hour, and 3-day groups (100%) but was effective in only 2 of 4 animals in the 6-day group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall thrombolytic efficacy was 78%+/-7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Control saline solution showed no thrombolytic effect (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty successfully restored <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fully lysed arteries (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis showed fibrin-predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> with a varying degree of platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This endovascular approach, which creates a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> using this novel stent-graft device, is reliable in producing carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In our model, thrombolytic therapy was effective in restoring <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> patency, and the intraluminal stenosis is amenable to balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The model is useful for the evaluation of antithrombotic therapy and adjunctive endovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
