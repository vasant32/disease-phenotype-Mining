<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether early (&lt; 8 hours) or delayed (8 to 24 hours) recanalization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be an independent variable in the improvement of clinical outcome in patients with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 77 patients by combined Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at admission, repeated computed tomography and angiography before and after thrombolytic treatment at &lt; 8 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested an association between clinical and neuroradiological baseline characteristics, recanalization, and outcome as assessed by the modified Rankin Scale 4 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and determined the effect of recanalization on mortality and good outcome (Rankin Scale grades 0 to 3) by multiple logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization rates at 8 and 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> correlated with sites of occlusion (middle cerebral artery branch, 73% and 73%, trunk, 27% and 38%, respectively; intracranial internal carotid artery bifurcation, 14% and 14%; P = .002), collaterals (good, 43% and 51%, respectively; scarce, 17% and 19%, respectively; P = .01), and Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at admission (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of 6 patients with delayed recanalization had good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization at &lt; 8 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> had no independent predictive value for good outcome (P = .69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization at 24 hours increased the proportion of good outcomes from 23% to 75% in a subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization did not independently affect mortality (P &gt; .15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even if delayed, arterial recanalization may improve clinical outcome in a subgroup of patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
