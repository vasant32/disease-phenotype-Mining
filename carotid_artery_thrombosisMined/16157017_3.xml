<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore whether free radical damage against DNA exists or not, in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Urinary 8-hyroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and serum S100beta were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with relatively severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During days 3--5 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, urine was collected for 24 hours for 8-OHdG measurement and serum was sampled for S100beta analysis every day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total urinary 8-OHdG content was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than in non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> inpatients (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average value was more than twice the value of that of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> inpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total urinary 8-OHdG contents showed significant correlation (r=0.87, p&lt;0.01) with serum S100beta values, which are reportedly related to brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that urinary 8-OHdG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients may originate from brain tissue, and DNA damage also exists in the brain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
