<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although MRI can discriminate the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core from the collagenous cap of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in vitro with T2 contrast, it has not yet produced detailed in vivo images of these human plaque components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We imaged seven lesions from six patients who required surgical carotid endarterectomy and calculated T2 in vivo before surgery in various plaque regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the same acquisition parameters, we repeated these measurements in vitro on the resected fragment and compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2 values calculated in vivo correlate with in vitro measurements for each plaque component; the in vitro discrimination we demonstrated previously with T2 contrast can therefore be performed similarly in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI is the first noninvasive imaging technique that allows the discrimination of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> cores, fibrous caps, calcifications, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> media, and adventitia in human atheromatous plaques in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This technique also characterizes intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result may support further investigations that include MRI of plaque progression, stabilization, and rupture in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
