<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indication for surgery was based on the following criteria: hemodynamic efficacy of the stenosis, risk of embolism of the vascular lesion, causal connection between the extracranial stenosis and the neurological deficit, and exclusion of a serious concomitant internal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As operation technique, open thrombendarterectomy using an intraluminal shunt was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The arteriotomy was closed by means of a patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When there was a simultaneous elongation of the internal carotid artery (kinking), the internal was shortened with reinsertion into the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In stage I the surgical mortality was 0.9%, and the surgical morbidity (cerebrovascular deficit of ischemic origin) was 1.2%; in stage II the corresponding figures were 1.2% and 2.4% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The period of follow-up observation comprised three to 207 months (up to 17 years) with an average value of 70 months for patients of stage I and 67 months for patients of stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients of stage I suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 1.4% (n = 9) and patients in stage II suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 2.4% (n = 10) of cases i.e. annually 0.2% in stage I and 0.3% in stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There have been various reports on the favorable spontaneous course of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> treated non-surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of 1% to 3% was reported for stage I and a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of 3% to 4% was reported for stage II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
