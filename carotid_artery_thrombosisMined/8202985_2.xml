<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We compared the current antithrombotic strategy of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, with a specific genetically engineered chimeric antibody (c7E3 Fab) directed against the human <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor in an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were instrumented for monitoring of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and carotid artery flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with saline (n = 6), aspirin (25 mg PO daily for 3 days; n = 6), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (100 U/kg i.v. plus infusion adjusted to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time at 2 to 3 times baseline; n = 6), aspirin plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (as administered separately, n = 6), or c7E3 Fab (0.10 mg/kg i.v., n = 7; 0.15 mg/kg i.v., n = 6; 0.20 mg/kg i.v., n = 6; 0.25 mg/kg i.v., n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation via anodal electrolytic stimulation (100 microA) to the intimal surface of the right carotid artery was initiated 15 minutes after drug administration and continued for 180 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrolytic injury to the left carotid artery began 210 minutes after drug administration and continued for 180 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole blood cell counts, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor blockade, ex vivo platelet aggregation, template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, and activated partial thromboplastin time were assessed at various time points throughout the experimental protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemodynamic and hematologic parameters were comparable among groups at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with c7E3 Fab inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>increased bleeding time</z:hpo>, decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight, and increased time to occlusion in a dose-dependent manner in both vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with aspirin, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, or the combination of aspirin plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was ineffective for the prevention of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of the platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor with c7E3 Fab was found to be safe and effective for the prevention of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, whereas treatment with either aspirin or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or the combination of the two agents failed to protect against occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in cynomolgus monkeys </plain></SENT>
