<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect and the mechanism of Xuesaitong drop pills (total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26605">saponins</z:chebi> in Radix Notoginseng; XDP) on experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, thrombolysis and blood theology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: First, the rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, XDP (90, 30, 10 mg x kg(-1)), Xuesaitong tablet (XP) 30 mg x kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the effect of the drugs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was studied after the ratsthrombosis was induced by the arteriovenous shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, the rats were randomly divided into seven groups: model, XDP (90, 30, 10 mg x kg(-1)), XT (90, 30 mg x kg(-1)), lumbrukinase capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then the effect of the drugs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was studied after the rats'<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by the electrical stimulation of common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Third, the rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, model, XDP (80, 40 mg x kg(-1)), XT (40, 20 mg x kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then the effect of the drugs on blood circulation promoting was observed after the rats'<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> blood stasis induced by adrenalin and icy water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: XDP 90, 30 mg x kg(-1) could notably lighten the wet-weight and dry-weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the arteriovenous shunt model in rats in a dose-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>XDP 90 mg x kg(-1) with intragastric administration for 3 days had the satisfactory effect on thrombolysis after the rat's <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by the electrical stimulation of common carotid artery (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>XDP 80, 40 , 20 mg x kg(-1) reduced significantly erythrocyte aggregation (P &lt; 0.01) and decreased the whole blood viscosity at low shear rate (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>XDP 80, 40 mg x kg(-1) reduced the whole blood viscosity at high shear rate and plasma viscosity (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>XDP 80 mg x kg(-1) decreased the whole blood viscosity at high shear rate (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: XDP can significantly inhibit the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and has the satisfactory effect on thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One kind of the mechanism is related to the effect on blood rheology </plain></SENT>
