<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of arterial segments compressed by the surgical clip for 30 minutes, followed by 2 hours of reflow, revealed marked attachment of platelets and deposition of erythrocytes, with very few leukocytes, to exposed subendothelial tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This thrombotic deposition protruded as much as 150 mu into the vascular lumen (15% of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in animals pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi>, this deposition was limited to isolated areas of single or very few platelets with few erythrocytes or leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in overall quantity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation between nontreated and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi>-treated groups was much less obvious after 24 hours; however, fewer leukocytes and erythrocytes were seen to be attached to the platelet carpet in the treated group as compared with the nontreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> on the overall quantity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation corresponded inversely to the measured levels of serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> in these groups </plain></SENT>
