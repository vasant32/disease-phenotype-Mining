<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> regressed spontaneously subsequent to ipsilateral ICA endarterectomy and reversal of blood flow in the PCoA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The formation and regression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was well documented by repeat cerebral digital subtraction angiography studies, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the formation and regression of this 'flow-related' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was associated with hemodynamic changes in blood flow of the right PCoA and the right ICA </plain></SENT>
