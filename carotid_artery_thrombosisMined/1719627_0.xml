<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By means of transcranial Doppler (TCD), the author reports intracranial haemodynamic consequences of 57 stenosis or occlusions of the internal carotid artery (ICA), 13 dissections and 44 atheromatous lesions, in 50 patients 32 of whom having had angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If a stenosis is significant, the curve of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) becomes dampened and PTI (Pulsatility Transmission Index) diminishes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this series, the association <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> curve dampened and PTI lower than 0.90 is the evidence of a more than 90% stenosis, except in 2 atheromatous and symptomatic occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No precise explanation for these exceptions is given by literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ICA stenosis has also an influence on communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, collateralisation by the circle of Willis exists in 14% of 50-75% stenosis, 72.7% of 75-90% stenosis and 100% of more than 90% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can depend on anterior communicating artery (ACoA) alone, posterior communicating artery (PCoA) alone or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detailed study of the 3 groups leads to the hypothesis of a hierarchy in the function of the communicating arteries, ACoA having the priority </plain></SENT>
