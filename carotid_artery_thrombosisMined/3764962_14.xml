<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient population, selection, perioperative management, and the technical aspects of the operation, except for the vein patch, were essentially identical in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery status was assessed by direct continuous wave Doppler and Gee OPG at three to six months and again at one year postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were two hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, both in the nonpatched group, one cardiac and the other neurologic due to internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two reversible neurological deficits due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and one due to restenosis occurred in the non-patched group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic greater than 50% diameter restenosis occurred in four and asymptomatic occlusion in one non-patched carotids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no restenosis, no occlusions and no neurologic symptoms in the patched group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morbidity, mortality, restenosis or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-occlusion occurred in 10/100 (10%) non-patched and 0/100 (0%) patched arteries (p less than 0.01 by Chi Square) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restenosis or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-occlusion occurred in 9/100 (9%) of non-patched and 0/100 (0%) patched arteries (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the use of saphenous vein patch angioplasty reconstruction of carotid endarterectomy to protect against early restenosis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-occlusion </plain></SENT>
