<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of VN in the earliest response to vascular injury, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, is not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that variation in vitronectin expression alters the thrombotic response to arterial injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">Ferric chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi>) injury was used to induce platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in mouse carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (VN +/+, n = 14) and VN-deficient (VN -/-, n = 15) mice, matched for age and gender, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time to occlusion after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> injury was determined by application of a Doppler flowprobe to the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Occlusion times of VN -/- mice were significantly shorter than those of VN +/+ mice (6.0 +/- 1.2 minutes v 17.8 +/- 2.3 minutes, respectively, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologic analysis of injured arterial segments showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> from VN +/+ and VN -/- mice consisted of dense platelet aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies of murine VN +/+ and VN -/- platelets showed no significant differences in <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation, but a trend towards increased thrombin-induced aggregation in VN -/- platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Purified, denatured VN inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, whereas native VN did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombin times of plasma from VN -/- mice (20.5 +/- 2.1 seconds, n = 4) were significantly shorter than those of VN +/+ mice (34.2 +/- 6.7 seconds, n = 4, P &lt; .01), and the addition of purified VN to VN -/- plasma prolonged the thrombin time into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, suggesting that VN inhibits thrombin-fibrinogen interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PAI-1-deficient mice (n = 6) did not demonstrate significantly enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (n = 6), excluding a potential indirect antithrombin function of VN mediated by interactions with PAI-1 as an explanation for the accelerated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> observed in VN -/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that vitronectin plays a previously unappreciated antithrombotic role at sites of arterial injury and that this activity may be mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting platelet-platelet interactions and/or thrombin procoagulant activity </plain></SENT>
