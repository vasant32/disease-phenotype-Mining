<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was based on the hypothesis that abnormalities in peripheral artery are responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral arterial coagulability was investigated in a rabbit experimental model in which AF was induced by high-frequency stimulation of the right atrium, creating stenosis of the carotid artery together with endothelial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rabbits were classified into 4 groups: (i) sinus rhythm only (group 1), (ii) sinus rhythm after 6 h of pacing (group 2), (iii) short AF (continuous pacing for 5 min; group 3) and (iv) long AF (continuous pacing for 6 h: group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid blood flow developed a typical pattern, called cyclic flow reductions (CFRs), the frequency of which (CFRF) was 18.59+/-2.85 in AF (group 3+4) compared with 14.46+/-2.1 in sinus rhythm (group 1+2) (p&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the groups with AF, correlation analysis showed an association between CFRF and pulse dispersion (p&lt;0.02, r=0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the distinctive hemodynamic effects with AF, in particular pulse dispersion, substantively influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation on injured vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
