<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with VBI significantly showed a weak collateral circulation and tight stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral ICA, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for the VBI was hemodynamic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emboligenic factors ICA (stump, external carotid artery or common carotid artery ulcerated stenosis, ulcerated plaque on the contralateral ICA) dit not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, vascular risk factors, vertebrobasilar or sub-clavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> did not influence the development of VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a hemodynamic phenomenon is the cause of VBI in our cases, probably from an intracranial steal from the vertebro-basilar circulation towards the carotid system </plain></SENT>
