<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a decrease in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) caused by ischemic changes may also decrease the CBF response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> by decreasing the production of carbon dioxide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether the values of CBV and CMRO(2) are independent predictors of the CBF response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in major cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography to study 30 patients with major cerebral artery steno-occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBF response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was assessed by measuring baseline CBF and CBF 10 min after an intravenous injection of 1 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was used to test the independent predictive value of the CBV and CMRO(2) at baseline with respect to the percent change in CBF during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both increased CBV and decreased CMRO(2) were significant and independent predictors of the reduced CBF response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBV accounted for 25% of the variance in the absolute change in CBF during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> administration and 42% of the variance in the percent change in CBF, whereas CMRO(2) accounted for 19% and 4% of the variance, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with major cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e>, a decrease in CMRO(2) may contribute to the reduced CBF response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, although an increase in CBV appears to be the major contributing factor </plain></SENT>
