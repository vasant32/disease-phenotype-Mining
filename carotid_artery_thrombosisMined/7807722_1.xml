<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> density region on X-ray CT, a significant negative correlation was observed between Angiographic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This indicates that cerebral blood flow can be estimated by Angiographic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the ratio of cerebral blood volume (CBV) to CBF (CBV/CBF), i.e., mean transit time determined by PET well agreed with OEF, and is good indicator for brain circulation reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, no significant correlation was observed between Angiographic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and CBV/CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a significant positive correlation was observed between Angiographic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and no significant correlation was observed between Angiographic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and oxygen consumption rate (CMRO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These indicates that Angiographic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> may be indicator for brain circulation reserve </plain></SENT>
