<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of prophylactic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> in a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> vascular model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three groups of Wistar rats, control (n = 6), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> (n = 6) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> + HO-1 inhibitor (n = 6), were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">Hemin</z:chebi>-treated animals received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg/d; I.P.) for seven days and HO-1 inhibitor group received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> at the same dose and SnPP IX (60 mg/kg/d; I.P.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were exposed to electric stimulation of the left carotid according to Kawasaki's procedure to induce reproducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> treatment did not induce blood pressure disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> on vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were quantified by histopathology and its influence on haemostasis was assessed by measuring prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and blood parameters at the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HO-1 mRNA and protein level variation were also checked out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> significantly (p &lt; 0.01) reduced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> degree when compared to control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> SnPP groups with 7.2 +/- 4.6 vs. 71.1 +/- 14.7 and 74.0 +/- 8.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed significant (p &lt; 0.05) perturbations of blood parameters in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi>-treated and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi>-SnPP treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> treatment did not significantly increase both PT and APTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the HO-1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi>-treated carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> by inducing HO-1 expression may be a preventive agent against clinical disorders associated to an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> events and may limit haemorrhagic risks </plain></SENT>
