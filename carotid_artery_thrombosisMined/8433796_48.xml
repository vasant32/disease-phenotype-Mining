<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A group of 59 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vertebrobasilar or carotid territory occlusion have been treated by local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high recanalisation rate was accomplished with either urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, with either substance, even if a high dose was used, recanalisation was a time-consuming process which usually took 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reasonable explanation for the lack of effectiveness of these plasminogen-activating substances might be a deficit of substrate, e.g. plasminogen, in aged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LIF was capable of improving clinical outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, reducing mortality to 50% in patients fulfilling inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the carotid territory multiple occlusions had a poor prognosis while good clinical results could be achieved in occlusions of the proximal middle cerebral artery or single branches </plain></SENT>
