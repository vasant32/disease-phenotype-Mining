<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> would be neuroprotective following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using a rabbit embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model with a well-defined behavioral endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM), a drug or drug combination is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the amount of microclots (mg) measured in brain that produce neurologic dysfunction in 50% of a group of animals (P(50)) compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg, s.c.), increased the P(50) value to 1.80+/-0.24 mg (p&lt;0.05) when administered 5 min following embolization and increased P(50) values by 195% and 161% (compared to control) when administered 1 and 3 h following embolization, respectively, but was inactive when applied 6 h following embolization, compared to the cumulative control group (P(50)=0.93+/-0.16 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To simulate the design of current clinical trials, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> was also given following a standard tPA regimen, which by itself increased the P(50) value to 2.72+/-0.28 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When tPA was infused 1 h following embolization and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> was given 3 h following embolization, the P(50) was 2.68+/-0.56 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> may have substantial therapeutic benefit for the treatment of AIS since it had a therapeutic widow of at least 3 h in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> can also be administered with a thrombolytic to improve behavior </plain></SENT>
