<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the 133xenon-inhalation technique, we evaluated the effects of enalapril on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 7 with CAOD and 7 without CAOD (no CAOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF and blood pressure were measured before and 60 minutes after a single dose of enalapril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in mean arterial pressure after enalapril were not significantly different between the two groups: CAOD -4.67 +/- 8.7 mm Hg, no CAOD -6.18 +/- 8.2 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in mean CBF after enalapril were also not statistically different: CAOD -1.0 +/- 3.9, no CAOD 1.0 +/- 2.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the CAOD group only, however, changes in CBF were significantly related to increasing age (r = -0.9253, p less than 0.01), such that in patients 65 years or older CBF tended to decrease, whereas in younger patients it increased </plain></SENT>
