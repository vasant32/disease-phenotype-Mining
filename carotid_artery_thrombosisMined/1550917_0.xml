<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> was 50% with a 31% (18 of 58) of hemodynamically insignificant restenoses, a 13.8% (8 of 58) incidence of haemodynamically significant restenoses, and a 5.2% (3 of 58) of occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The segment that had been endarterectomized showed a bulbous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in 24.1% (14 of 58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases extensive flow reversal zones could be demonstrated, the possible importance of which is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examinations in 9 patients with reimplantation of subclavian artery to the common carotid artery and grafting technique between these arteries and in 11 patients with reimplantation of vertebral artery to the common carotid artery demonstrated one occlusion of the ipsilateral vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
