<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid atherosclerotic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic efficacy of either aspirin or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> alone in this setting is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently we developed a simple model, the "clamp" method, to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo in guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used this model to evaluate the antithrombotic effects of aspirin, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and their combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four male guinea pigs were divided equally into control, aspirin, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and combined groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physiological saline, aspirin (5 mg/kg body wt), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (200 units/kg body wt), or a combination of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, respectively, was injected via the jugular vein before the use of the clamp method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after the injection of saline or drug(s), PÃ©an's forceps was used to clamp the carotid artery at a tangent angle for 3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hour later, the carotid artery was resected and prepared for observation under a scanning electron microscope or light microscope to evaluate the degree of mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that the combination of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> had an excellent effect in inhibiting in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.001) and was significantly better than the effect of aspirin alone (p &lt; 0.01) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> alone (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study clearly demonstrated that the combined use of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> produced a much better antithrombotic effect than either agent alone at sites of carotid endothelial injury when given before the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This combined regimen may be useful clinically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid diseases</z:e> or carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
