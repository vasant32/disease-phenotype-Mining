<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The value of combined diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) for detecting ischemic lesions of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic injury was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combined pre- and posttreatment DWI and PWI studies were used to assess the efficacy of intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intra-arterial thrombolysis was performed within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 10 patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery or internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI and PWI obtained before and after treatment were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final T2-weighted magnetic resonance scans were obtained 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis resulted in recanalization in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mismatch ratio percentage ([initial PWI-initial DWI/initial PWI] x 100) and the rescued ratio percentage ([initial PWI-final T2/initial PWI] x 100) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) was used for neurological assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity at admission and at 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the mismatch ratio was greater than 60% (mean +/- standard deviation, 81.7 +/- 16.7%) and was significantly correlated with initial NIHSS score (-0.74; P = 0.03), and the rescued ratio was significantly correlated with the NIHSS score 1 month after the insult (r = -0.83; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients who exhibited recanalization of the occluded artery (n = 7), the mean rescued ratio was 89.6 +/- 12.8% (range, 63-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the lesion volume on posttreatment DWI scans and final T2-weighted magnetic resonance images was not enlarged; on posttreatment PWI scans, it was significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The NHISS score at 1 month after the insult (2.3 +/- 2.1) was markedly improved as compared with the initial NHISS score (10.7 +/- 3.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a small number of patients who presented with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the DWI/PWI mismatch ratio correlated with the initial neurological severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rescued ratio may be an objective indicator of the efficacy of treatment </plain></SENT>
