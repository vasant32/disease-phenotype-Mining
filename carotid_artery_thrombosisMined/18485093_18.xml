<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Platelet membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) is considered to be essential for hemostasis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but the in vivo topography of platelet PS has not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that platelet PS exposure would be identified on adherent platelets at the site of vascular injury and that blockade of PS would impede hemostasis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To localize and estimate the extent of platelet PS exposure and evaluate the impact of PS blockade in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lactadherin, a PS-binding milk protein, was utilized together with annexin V to detect both partial and complete membrane PS exposure on platelets in a mouse model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and to evaluate the functional need for PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preliminary experiments were performed with synthetic membranes and with purified platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of lactadherin-binding sites on synthetic membranes was proportional to PS content, whereas annexin V required a threshold of 2.5-8% PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 95% of thrombin-stimulated platelets exposed PS, but the quantity was below the threshold for annexin V binding at physiologic Ca(2+) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In mice, most adherent and aggregated platelets on the walls of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-treated mesenteric veins exposed low levels of PS, rather than having complete exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In mice, blockade of PS with lactadherin inhibited platelet prothrombinase and factor Xase activity, and prolonged tail <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time and the time to carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In vivo PS exposure contributes to both hemostasis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this model of vascular injury, most platelets exhibit partial rather than complete PS exposure </plain></SENT>
