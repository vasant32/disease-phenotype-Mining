<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION Internal carotid artery (ICA) kinking is a pathological malformation with angulation of the vessel's axis of 90 degrees or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that kinking causes the reduction of flow within the vessel that may be exacerbated by progressive head rotation up to the point that causes complete cessation of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report on the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reversible ischaemic deficit induced by internal carotid artery kinking and immediate neurological recovery following surgical reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE OUTLINE A 64-year-old woman was admitted to Vascular Surgery Clinic due to severe dizziness, fainting and walking instability, suddenly arising a few days prior to admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two years before, the left ICA reconstruction was done for kinking, after which there was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms have been present perpetually, enhanced when resting and with head movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT angiography (MSCT) showed haemodynamic significant right ICA kinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The left ICA postoperative finding was regular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography (CT) of the endocranium was done and no novel lessions were verified than those seen two years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resection, shortening and reimplantation of the right ICA were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A few hours following surgical reconstruction, there was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> symptoms, neither when resting nor with head movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the third postoperative day, the patient was discharged for home treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgical repair for symptomatic ICA kinking contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> symptoms reduction, improves cerebral perfusion and significantly prevents carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we have seen that in case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> symptoms and ICA kinking, surgical ICA treatment appears to be justified </plain></SENT>
