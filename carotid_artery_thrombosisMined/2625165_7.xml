<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the period 1976 to 1986 we encountered 18 extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were atherosclerotic (12 in 9 patients), congenital (3 in 2 patients), mycotic (1) and secondary (false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) after previous carotid surgery (2 in 2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients presented with neurological symptoms (11) or a pulsating mass in the neck (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was detected accidentally during angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From this study it became clear that "carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>" is not a well defined entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" configuration of the carotid bulb with its usually larger diameter, is in part a cause of the problem of definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A recently described technique for predicting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel diameters in stenosing lesions of the carotid arteries was retrospectively applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With these measurements, made on standard preoperative angiograms, it was possible to quantify the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, and confirm the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 14 patients were operated on without mortality, no neurological deficits were seen as a result of the operation and minimal morbidity occurred in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From this study we conclude that surgical correction of accessible carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is a relatively safe procedure and these lesions should be operated on irrespective of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report that gives clear guidelines for measuring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the extracranial carotid arteries and based on these guidelines we suggest criteria for the discrimination between physiological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation, the latter condition being an indication for operation </plain></SENT>
