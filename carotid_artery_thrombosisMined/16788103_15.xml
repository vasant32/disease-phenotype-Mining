<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work has demonstrated that bt/VWF-mediated agglutination activates alphaIIbbeta3 and elicits ATP secretion in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (TxA2)-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signaling that results in TxA2 production was shown to be initiated by Lyn, enhanced by Src, and propagated through Syk, SLP-76, PI3K, PLCgamma2, and PKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that the signaling elicited by GPIb-mediated agglutination that results in TxA2 production is dependent on Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that Btk is downstream of Lyn, Syk, SLP-76, and PI3K; upstream of ERK1/2, PLCgamma2, and PKC; and greatly enhances Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship(s), if any, between ERK1/2, PLCgamma2, and PKC were not elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The requirement for Btk and TxA2 receptor function in GPIb-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was confirmed in vivo by characterizing blood flow in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-treated mouse carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the Btk family kinase, Tec, cannot provide the function(s) missing because of the absence of Btk and that Btk is essential for both bt/VWF-mediated agglutination-induced TxA2 production and GPIb-dependent stable arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo </plain></SENT>
