<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A critical component in the regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and clearance is the balance between tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in the plasma concentration of PAI-1 has been proposed as a risk factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PAI-1 activity may have utility in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here the evaluation of three diketopiperazine-based low molecular weight inhibitors of PAI-1 activity (XR334, XR1853 and XR5082) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro these compounds reversed the inhibitory effects of PAI-1 against both tPA and urokinase (UK) (IC50: 5 to 80 muM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other serpin-serine protease interactions, including alpha 1-antitrypsin-trypsin, alpha 2-antiplasmin- plasmin and antithrombin-thrombin, were not affected, neither did these inhibitors affect global tests of haemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the light of this promising in vitro profile these compounds were evaluated in a standard radioisotopic assay of clot lysis in whole rat blood following intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this assay these compounds dose-dependently enhanced fibrinolysis ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After intravenous bolus administration XR334, XR1853 and XR5082 at 5 mg/kg increased clot lysis by 32.0 +/- 5.1% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> (n = 25, p &lt; 0.01), 36.7 +/- 3.5% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> (n = 36, p &lt; 0.01) and 60.0 +/- 2.8% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> (n = 17, p &lt; 0.01) respectively compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of these compounds (1 mg/kg/min for 20 min) significantly prolonged (approximately twofold) the time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">blood vessel occlusion</z:e> in the rat electrically-stimulated carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, these low molecular weight inhibitors of PAI-1 activity enhanced fibrinolysis ex vivo and protected against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the rat </plain></SENT>
