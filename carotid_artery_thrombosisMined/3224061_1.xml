<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six procedures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> occurred twice (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technical deficits, judged to be unacceptable, were identified and corrected in eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of the defects requiring repair occurred in the first 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two of the last 45 required revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred when an intimal flap was overlooked on an inadequate arteriogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An intimal laceration attributable to the arteriogram was readily identified and repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An unexpected benefit of completion arteriography has been its educational value with respect to surgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our early experience with unsuspected technical defects has led us to place greater emphasis on assuring <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> adequacy and avoiding arterial kinks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, operative revisions have been required much less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We strongly believe that intraoperative assessment to assure the technical adequacy of carotid reconstruction is imperative if optimal results are to be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Routine completion arteriography proved highly satisfactory for this purpose, and its use improved operative technique </plain></SENT>
