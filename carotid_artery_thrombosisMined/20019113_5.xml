<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Large IC <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is often resistant to recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our initial experience with the PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Presenting with a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the first 27 consecutive patients were considered for thromboaspiration therapy and retrospective data base analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received standard thrombectomy treatment as monotherapy or in combination with thrombolysis or IC stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was revascularization of the target vessel to grade 2 or 3 on the TICI scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were improvement of &gt;4 points on the NIHSS score at discharge and favorable outcome, and improvement in overall mortality at 3 months and in sICH- and procedure-related adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age was 66 +/- 14 years and the mean NIHSS score was 14 +/- 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anterior circulation was affected in 23 patients, and there were 4 basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stent placement was performed in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A recanalization to TICI 2 or 3 was achieved in 25 patients (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed sICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At hospital discharge, 15 patients (56%) had an NIHSS improvement of &gt;4 and 13 patients (48%) had an mRS score of &lt;2 at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between complete vessel recanalization and favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality at 3 months was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PS showed a high potential for recanalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboembolic occlusions of the large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization was strongly correlated with good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
