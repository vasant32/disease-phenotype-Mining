<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these clinical findings were investigated in an anatomic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two-thirds of these cases, the congenital "anomalous" relationship of ICA and CN XII caused a strangulation phenomenon during extreme turning manoeuvres of the head and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our clinical intraoperative findings, anatomic studies und reports in the literature, a further mechanism of vascular injury is suggested in this area </plain></SENT>
