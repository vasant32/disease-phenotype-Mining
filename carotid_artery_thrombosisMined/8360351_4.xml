<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reports from the literature demonstrated an early occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate of microvascular anastomoses of up to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to reduce free flap failure due to kinking and pressure in the region of the anastomosis, fibrin sealing of microvascular anastomosis was recommended in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is well accepted that haemostasis is activated by vascular wall injuries (lesions of the endothelial layer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For that reason, a fast re-endothelialisation of the inner surface of the anastomosis is thought to reduce early occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and, subsequent, free flap failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether application of fibrin adhesives exert any effect on microvascular anastomoses, we constructed 84 anastomoses in rat arteries applying sealant or non-sealant in randomized order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At certain time intervals, arteries operated on were removed and histologically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early complete endothelial regeneration, 4 days after surgery, was observed in the unsealed anastomosis group, whereas sealed anastomosis showed a complete re-endothelialisation only after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations may be explained by a reduced multiplication rate and migration speed (0.3 mm/day) of endothelial cells during the first 3 days (unsealed anastomosis: 0.63 mm/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, in sealed anastomoses a higher incidence of media <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was found (60.7% vs 49.3% in the unsealed group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These histological changes were confirmed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
