<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the symptomatologic characteristics and the prognosis were discussed with reference to the data in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four mechanisms by which the condition may be produced include; injury to the intrapetrous or cevernous portion of the carotid artery during basal skull fracture, injury to the point of emergence of the carotid artery from the cavernous sinus as a result of shearing strains suffered at the time of injury, a direct blow to the neck or trauma to the paratonsillar area by a foreign object carried in the mouth, and stretching of the carotid artery by heperextension and lateral flexion of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary symptoms due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the carotid artery after an interval develop most commonly from twelve to twenty four hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognosis in these patients is mostly poor </plain></SENT>
