<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proatherogenic and/or prothrombotic effects may underlie the potential causal relation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> and cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, the effects of selective lowering of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, plasma cholesterol, or both on endothelial function and on atherogenesis in male hyperlipidemic and hyperhomocysteinemic C57BL/6 low-density <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor (LDLr)(-/-)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi>-β-synthase (CBS)(+/-)-deficient mice were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, we evaluated whether selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> lowering has anti-thrombotic effects in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A hyperhomocysteinemic and atherogenic diet was started at the age of 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three weeks later, gene transfer was performed with E1E3E4-deleted adenoviral vectors for hepatocyte-restricted overexpression of CBS (AdCBS) or of the LDLr (AdLDLr), or with the control vector Adnull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a fourth group, AdCBS and AdLDLr were co-administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> lowering but not selective cholesterol lowering restored endothelial function at 6 weeks after gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intimal area in the aortic root and in the brachiocephalic artery at 13 weeks was more than 100-fold (p &lt; 0.001) smaller in AdLDLr and AdCBS/AdLDLr mice than in control mice and AdCBS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences in intimal area were observed between control mice and AdCBS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the average time to first occlusion and to stable occlusion were 1.9-fold (p &lt; 0.01) and 2.1-fold longer (p &lt; 0.01), respectively, in AdCBS-treated mice than in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data show that correction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> following selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> lowering has anti-thrombotic but no anti-atherogenic effects </plain></SENT>
