<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent in vitro studies using human plasma have shown enhanced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effects of hAPC by mutagenesis of either loop 148 in the serine protease domain or of the Gla domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Gla-domain mutant QGNSEDY-hAPC (= H10Q/S11G/S12N/D23S/Q32E/N33D/H44Y) was found to be particularly active as an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now combined the two mutations to create the variant QGNSEDY-hAPC:B148 and investigated the in vivo effects of this variant as well as of QGNSEDY-hAPC and WT hAPC using a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro clotting experiments using rat plasma demonstrated WT hAPC to be inefficient, whereas both mutant hAPC variants yielded distinct dose dependent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the arterial injury model, a segment of the left common carotid artery was opened longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An endarterectomy was performed and the arteriotomy was closed, whereafter the vessel was reperfused and the patency rate determined after 31 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three treatment groups each containing 10 rats and a control group of 20 animals were in a blind random fashion given intravenous bolus injections of 0.8 mg/kg WT or mutant hAPC or vehicle only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ex vivo clotting times of plasma drawn 3 min after the injections, as compared to baseline clotting times, were approximately doubled by QGNSEDY-hAPC and tripled by QGNSEDY-hAPC:B148 infusions, while WT APC had little effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to the control group, none of the hAPC preparations had significant antithrombotic effect or increased arteriotomy <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
