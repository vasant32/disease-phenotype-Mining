<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fucoidan is a highly sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi>, which has a molecular structure similar to that of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic effects of fucoidan in vitro have been widely reported, but its antithrombotic effects in vivo as well as its other biological properties in vitro have not been well investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study investigated the effects and mechanism of fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-induced mouse carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model was used to determine the antithrombotic effects of fucoidan in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, changes in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were examined in vascular cells treated with fucoidan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vivo studies employing a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi>-induced mouse carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model indicated that fucoidan had a stronger antithrombotic activity than <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, vascular cells treated with fucoidan demonstrated a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production as well as inhibition of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The major findings of this study showed that fucoidan has a stronger antithrombotic effect than <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in vivo and that fucoidan has an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine production and proliferation of vascular cells </plain></SENT>
