<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The question is whether spasm is a triggering factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a stenotic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>If so, what are the mechanisms for this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A stenosing <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">teflon</z:chebi> ring was applied to the right common carotid artery of anesthetized rabbits and 1-nor-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> was dripped over the outer surface of both carotid arteries, causing spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In control animals an indifferent solution did not cause spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen rabbits were killed 30 min or 24 h after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, arteries with stenosis and spasm contained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> nearby the stenosis significantly more often than arteries in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In another 14 rabbits, killed at 30 min, the number of platelets on the intimal surface away from the stenosis was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In arteries with both stenosis and spasm the counts were significantly greater than in arteries with no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intimal surface in stenotic and spastic arteries showed assumed imprints of eddying flow and endothelial injury downstream and upstream of the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Spastic arteries showed increased folding of the internal elastic membrane, altered endothelial cells, and adhering platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spasm in a rabbit artery with a preformed stenosis facilitates <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> probably by creating increased flow disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Spasm may induce endothelial injury, causing adherence of platelets </plain></SENT>
