<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now identify PRCP as a regulator of blood vessel homeostasis. Î²-Galactosidase staining in PRCP(gt/gt) mice reveals expression in kidney and vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Invasive telemetric monitorings show that PRCP(gt/gt) mice have significantly elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PRCP(gt/gt) mice demonstrate shorter carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> times in 2 models, and their plasmas have increased thrombin generation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic inhibition of PRCP with Z-Pro-Prolinal or plasma kallikrein with soybean trypsin inhibitor, Pro-Phe-Arg-chloromethylketone or PKSI 527 also shortens carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic and renal tissues have uncoupled eNOS and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PRCP(gt/gt) mice as detected by dihydroethidium or Amplex Red fluorescence or lucigenin luminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The importance of ROS is evidenced by the fact that treatment of PRCP(gt/gt) mice with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> (mitoTEMPO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi>, Tempol) abrogates the hypertensive, prothrombotic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, our studies reveal that PRCP(gt/gt) aortas express reduced levels of Kruppel-like factors 2 and 4, thrombomodulin, and eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, suggesting endothelial cell dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, PRCP siRNA treatment of endothelial cells shows increased ROS and uncoupled eNOS and decreased protein C activation because of thrombomodulin inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our studies identify PRCP as a novel regulator of vascular ROS and homeostasis </plain></SENT>
