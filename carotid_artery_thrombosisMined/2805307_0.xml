<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 900 consecutive elective endarterectomies performed during an 8-year period, 41 patients experienced a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were subdivided into three groups: group 1, 22 patients with perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; group 2, six patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but without symptoms; and group 3, 13 patients with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group 1, 17 patients were reexplored (group 1a), and five were observed without reexploration (group 1b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 2, three of the patients were reexplored (group 2a), and the remaining three were observed (group 2b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the group 3 patients were reexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 1a, four (23%) patients awoke from anesthesia with neurological deficits, whereas in group 3, nine (69%) patients awoke with such deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at 30 days revealed that 76% of group 1a patients demonstrated improvement in symptoms, whereas similar results were seen in only 20% of group 1b patients and 23% of group 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These trends were maintained throughout the follow-up period of 1-5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those patients who were asymptomatic, group 2, with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were more likely to have been operated on for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>. with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were more likely to have been operated on for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was the most common cause of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (63%) in patients after carotid endarterectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
