<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe a successful neurorescue technique in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> immediately after carotid artery stenting (CAS) for a postsurgical restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old man with a symptomatic recurrent high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> after carotid endarterectomy was treated with CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The procedure was complicated by sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with clot propagation into the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy was performed with adjunctive infusion of intravenous abciximab, resulting in complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> dissolution and resolution of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Access to a mechanical thrombectomy device was essential for rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extraction, and adjunctive abciximab aided in residual clot dissolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result of this combined method of clot removal, a disastrous outcome was averted </plain></SENT>
