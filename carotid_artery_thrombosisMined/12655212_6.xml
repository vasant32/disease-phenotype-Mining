<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> as effectively as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and have better bioavailability and a longer plasma half-life, which explains the increased use of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> as substitutes for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the ability of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> has been debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors compared the antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and the low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dalteparin in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A segment of the left common carotid artery was isolated between vascular clamps and opened longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An endarterectomy was performed and the arteriotomy was closed with a running suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic effect (vascular patency 31 minutes after reperfusion) and the surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Groups of 10 rats were treated in a blind, random fashion with intravenous injection of one of the following substances 1 minute before clamp release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three groups received a bolus of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (20, 60, or 180 IU anti-factor Xa/kg), three groups received dalteparin (60, 180, or 540 IU anti-factor Xa/kg), and one group was treated with vehicle (saline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> 180 IU/kg produced a distinct antithrombotic effect compared with the control group (p = 0.03), but it also significantly increased the surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> to 2.0 g compared with 1.5 g in the control group (medians, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dalteparin 180 and 540 IU/kg also produced a powerful antithrombotic effect (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 180 IU/kg dalteparin did not increase the surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (median, 1.5 g; p = 0.37 versus controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dalteparin 540 IU/kg increased the median surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> to 2.6 g (p = 0.06 versus controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The nonsignificant difference may be explained by the great interindividual variation of surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the high-dose dalteparin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Dalteparin prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> as effectively as unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, dalteparin did not increase the surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, which indicates that dalteparin instead of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> can be used to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in microvascular surgery </plain></SENT>
