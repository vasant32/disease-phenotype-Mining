<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Commercial aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) was separated into molecular-weight (MW) fractions of &lt; 210 to &gt; 25,000, using gel permeation chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fractions with MW &gt; 1,300 effectively inhibited both botrocetin-induced vWF and bovine vWF binding to fixed human platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These activities decreased with a MW &gt; 17,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet retention for a human in vitro was reduced by ATA at 150 microM, as was that for rats ex vivo at 3 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATA prolonged tail transection <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time in rats but had only a weak effect on buccal mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ATA had no effect on platelet count but markedly prolonged PTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATA at 10 mg/kg exhibited antithrombotic activity and caused a marked improvement in patency status following successful thrombolysis by t-PA in electrically and copper coil-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that specific inhibitors of the vWF-GPIb interaction such as ATA may prove useful as antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
