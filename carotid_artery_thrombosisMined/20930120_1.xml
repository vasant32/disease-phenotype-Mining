<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Par3(-/-) and Par4(+/-) mouse platelets showed partially decreased responses to thrombin, resembling those in PAR1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>-treated human platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P2ry12(+/-) mouse platelets showed partially decreased responses to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, resembling those in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>-treated human platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Par3(-/-) mice showed nearly complete protection against carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> caused by low FeCl(3) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Par4(+/-) and P2ry12(+/-) mice showed partial protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing FeCl(3) injury abolished such protection; combining partial attenuation of thrombin and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> signaling, as in Par3(-/-):P2ry12(+/-) mice, restored it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Par4(-/-) mice, which lack platelet thrombin responses, showed still better protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that (i) the level of thrombin driving platelet activation and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was low at low levels of arterial injury and increased along with the contribution of thrombin-independent pathways of platelet activation with increasing levels of injury; (ii) although P2ry12 acts downstream of PARs to amplify platelet responses to thrombin ex vivo, P2ry12 functioned in thrombin/PAR-independent pathways in our in vivo models; and (iii) P2ry12 signaling was more important than PAR signaling in hemostasis models; the converse was noted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results make predictions being tested by ongoing human trials and suggest hypotheses for new antithrombotic strategies </plain></SENT>
