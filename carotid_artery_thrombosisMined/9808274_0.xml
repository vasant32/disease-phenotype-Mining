<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients (66 operations), 48 men and 16 women, mean age of 63+/-8 (SD) years, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were examined clinically 1 day before and after the carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except 3 patients had stenosis &gt; or =50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duplex scanning and periorbital Doppler were performed before aortic arch angiography, within 2 weeks after operation and thereafter at 3, 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 10 patients experienced minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and one major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after operation, in 5 patients connected with occlusion on the operated side, which differed (P&lt;0.01) from 56 patients with open vessels in whom 6 ipsilateral minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of 6 patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in whom the operated vessels were open, recovered, whereas the neurological deficits were permanent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients with occlusion (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duplex scanning confirmed 10 new occlusions and 2 high grade stenoses &gt;75% postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persisting morbidity was 11% and no mortality at 3 months' control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 months' control, 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> related to preoperatively diagnosed occlusion on the non-operated side and 14 flow reducing lesions &gt;75% (11 occlusions and 3 stenoses &gt;75%) were found in 57 (24.6%) of examined vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: occlusion occurs in immediate postoperative period and seems to be a serious complication connected with significantly higher number of persistent neurological events than open vessels </plain></SENT>
