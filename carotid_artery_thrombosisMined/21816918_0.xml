<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flexible microstents, such as the closed-cell EN, have facilitated adjunctive coiling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little data are available on the ability of the stent struts to maintain vessel-wall apposition once deployed in the tortuous cerebral vasculature and the prevalence of ISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between geometric features of the parent vessel at the stent deployment site and prevalence of ISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postprocedural 3T-MRA was performed in a cohort of 39 patients undergoing EN stent-assisted <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3T-MRA was analyzed for the presence of ISA and supplemented by angiographic C-arm FPCT (DynaCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parent vessel diameter, curvature radius, and stent-subtended arc angle were measured at the site of deployment and analyzed for prediction of ISA in the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 3T-MRA uncovered a unique crescent flow pattern (CS) outside the EN struts, which was confirmed by FPCT to indicate ISA resulting from EN crimping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ISA was detected on 3T-MRA in 19/39 patients (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed ISA in the ICA to correlate with a large stent-subtended angle, a small curvature radius, and a large diameter but not stent length or jailing versus a sequential technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified ISA to correlate with vessel-curvature radius (OR, 253; P = .009), stent-subtended angle (OR, 225; P = .005), and parent vessel diameter (OR, 8.49; P = .044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, ISA was detectable by 3T-MRA in a significant proportion of patients undergoing EN stent-assisted coiling of ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in a vessel geometry- and stent-deployment location-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This characteristic of EN coiling at this potentially tortuous location should be taken into account when selecting an endovascular strategy </plain></SENT>
