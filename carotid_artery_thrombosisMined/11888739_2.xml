<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The absence of technical defects is considered to be of great importance during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context, both safe surgical technique and intraoperative quality control may be a fundamental part of the operative procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore undertaken a prospective study to evaluate the possible benefits of completion angiography in standard CEA using patch angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives were three-fold: (1) to identify the incidence of defects requiring prompt revision; (2) to assess the perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate as well as the number of residual stenosis after 6 weeks in angiographically controlled patients and (3) to compare these results with a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 1 January to 30 September 1999 111 patients with 115 consecutive CEAs which had completion angiography (Group A) were prospectively entered into this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results in group A were compared with a series of again 111 patients (Group B) which had 116 CEAs without intraoperative quality control between January and September in the year before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical technique was identical in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, risk factors were distributed evenly among both group with the exception that in group A were significantly more high-grade ipsilateral ICA stenoses while group B had more patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ipsilateral CT-defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group A, angiographic irregularities prompted us to immediate re-exploration in five patients (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of severe ICA spasm 1; re-exploration of distal ICA occlusion 1; reopening of occluded ECA 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a 30 day mortality of 0% each perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was comparable with 3/115 in group A and 3/116 in group B (P=1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2/3 patients with neurological deficits in group A had early postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>--in spite of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> completion study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Duplex examination after 6 weeks revealed one asymptomatic ICA occlusion in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of residual stenosis (&gt; or =50%) was not significantly different being 3.7% in group A and 3.2% in group B (P=0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When applying a safe and simple operative technique for CEA, the incidence of abnormalities warranting immediate correction appears to be a rare event and, therefore, the necessity for obligatory quality control may be questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, completion DSA allows a simple documentation of the adequacy of the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
