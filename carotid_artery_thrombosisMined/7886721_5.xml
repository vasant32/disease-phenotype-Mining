<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1985 to January 1994, review of noninvasive vascular studies, arteriograms, and operative reports of 26 consecutive patients undergoing 27 carotid endarterectomies for carotid pseudo-occlusion was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further review was conducted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients identified with carotid occlusion by noninvasive testing who underwent confirmatory arteriography during the same interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Conventional gray-scale duplex scanning (January 1985 to December 1989) correctly identified 3 of 11 (27%) pseudo-occluded internal carotid arteries compared with 15 of 16 (94%) internal carotid artery pseudo-occlusions correctly identified by color-flow Doppler (January 1990 to June 1994) (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, carotid occlusion was more accurately identified by color-flow Doppler (33 of 33, 100%) compared with gray-scale duplex scanning (19 of 27, 90%) (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of color-flow Doppler to the duplex evaluation of the extracranial carotid circulation improves the accuracy of distinguishing carotid pseudo-occlusion from the occluded internal carotid artery and may obviate the need for arteriography to identify patients with this critical level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
