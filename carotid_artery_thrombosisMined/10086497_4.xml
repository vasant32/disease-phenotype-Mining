<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A low rate of recanalization and a high mortality rate for this condition have been noted, even with endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the results of emergency embolectomy in six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients were admitted to our institute within 2 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scans on admission revealed no low-density or high-density regions in any patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and completion of angiography ranged from 2 to 4 h (2.8 +/- 0.7 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Emergency embolectomy was performed for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was confirmed angiographically in four of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining two patients, massive infarction in the territory of the ICA was detected on the CT scans obtained the day of the operation, and postoperative angiography was not performed in these two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These two patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">uncal herniation</z:e> 6 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the six patients were able to walk with a cane 2 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining two patients were unable to walk or attend to their own bodily needs without assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The time elapsed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to reopening of the occluded vessel was within 6 h in the four surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The recanalization rate was 66.7% (4/6) for the embolectomy procedure, significantly higher than that (12.5%) of the thrombolytic therapy reported in a previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In summary, open embolectomy can be performed when the time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms is less than 6 h </plain></SENT>
