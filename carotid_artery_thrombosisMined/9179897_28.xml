<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ion implantation is a physicochemical surface modification process resulting from the impingement of a high-energy ion beam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ion implantation and protein coating were used to alter the surface properties (thrombogenicity, endothelial cellular migration, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>) of GDCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These modified coils were compared with standard GDCs in the treatment of experimental swine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an initial study, straight <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils were used to compare the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombogenicity of standard and modified coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modified coils were coated with albumin, fibronectin, or collagen and underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49996">Ne+</z:chebi> ion implantation at a dose of 1 x 10(15) ions/cm2 and an energy of 150 keV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coils were placed in common iliac arteries of 17 swine for 1 hour, to evaluate their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> interactions with circulating blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a second study, GDCs were used to treat 34 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in an additional 17 swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GDCs were coated with fibronectin, albumin, collagen, laminin, fibrinogen, or vitronectin and then implanted with ions as described above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bilateral experimental swine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were embolized with standard GDCs on one side and with ion-implanted, protein-coated GDCs on the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The necks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were evaluated macroscopically at autopsy, by using post-treatment Day 14 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dimensions of the orifice and the white fibrous membrane that covered the orifice were measured as the fibrous membrane to orifice proportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histopathological evaluation of the neck region was performed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fibronectin-coated, ion-implanted coils showed the greatest <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombogenicity (average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight for standard coils, 1.9 +/- 1.5 mg; weight for fibronectin-coated coils, 8.6 +/- 6.2 mg; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By using scanning electron microscopy, an intensive blood cellular response was observed on ion-implanted coil surfaces, whereas this was rare with standard coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At Day 14, greater fibrous coverage of the necks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was observed in the ion-implanted coil group (mean fibrous membrane to orifice proportion of 69.8 +/- 6.2% for the ion-implanted coil group, compared with 46.8 +/- 15.9% for the standard coil group; P = 0.0143) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary experimental study indicate that ion implantation combined with protein coating of GDCs improved cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Future application of this technology may provide early wound healing at the necks of embolized, wide-necked, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
