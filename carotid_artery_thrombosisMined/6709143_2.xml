<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different doses of aspirin (0.5 mg/kg vs. 10 mg/kg) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen hours after oral aspirin administration, 20 endarterectomies were performed on mongrel dogs with the use of the operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was then restored for 3 hours and the vessels were prepared for investigation with the scanning electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten endarterectomies were also performed on unmedicated dogs as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five minutes before vessel unclamping, autologous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111-labeled platelets were administered intravenously, and the endarterectomized portions of the vessels were studied with a gamma counter system after harvesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 1, the control group, revealed extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> consisting of platelet aggregates, fibrin, red blood cells, and white blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the 10 vessels in Group 2, premedicated with 0.5 mg of aspirin per kg, demonstrated varying amounts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 3 (10 vessels), premedicated with 10 mg of aspirin per kg, revealed a platelet monolayer completely covering the exposed vessel wall media, with scattered white blood cells and infrequent fine fibrin strands overlying the platelet surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SD) radioactivity per group expressed as counts/minute/mm2 was: Group 1--2055.3 +/- 1905.5, log = 7.253 +/- 0.926; Group 2--1235.6 +/- 1234.3, log = 6.785 +/- 0.817; Group 3--526 +/- 433.06, log = 5.989 +/- 0.774.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
