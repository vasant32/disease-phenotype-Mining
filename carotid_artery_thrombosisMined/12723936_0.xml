<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The anti-thrombotic effects of LB30057, a direct thrombin inhibitor, were evaluated with in vivo rat and dog <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rats, 1 mg/kg of LB30057 inhibited half of the clot formations in the inferior vena cava at 5 minutes after intravenous application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When measured at 2 hours after oral application, 100 mg/kg prevented approximately half of the clot formations in the inferior vena cava and 50 mg/kg prolonged the mean occlusion time from 15.6 +/- 1.3 minutes to 47.2 +/- 8.3 minutes in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In dogs, the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the jugular vein was reduced to half at a dose range of 20-30 mg/kg at 6 hours after oral application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the LB30057 dosage required to reduce venous clot formation by approximately 80-90% in dogs was only about 10% of that required for the same reduction in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is probably due to the variation in its time-dependent blood concentration profiles in each species; for example, the plasma half-life of LB71350 in dogs was longer than that in rats (153.0 +/- 3.0 vs. 129.7 +/- 12.7 min at 30 mg/kg, i.v., respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AUC, T(max), C(max), and BA in dogs were 59, 8.9, 9.17, and 13.3 times higher than those in rats at oral 30 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that LB30057 administered orally is effective in the prevention of arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in rats and dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It therefore represents a good lead compound for investigations to discover a new, orally available, therapeutic agent for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
