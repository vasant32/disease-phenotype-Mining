<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cofactor-independent thrombin inhibitors as adjunctive treatment to thrombolysis have been found to enhance reperfusion and reduce the incidence of early reocclusion more effectively than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> thrombin inhibitors presently available are rapidly cleared from the circulation which may cause rebound effects after cessation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-hirudin (LU 87981) a new, long acting derivative of hirudin as adjunctive treatment to rt-PA, a thrombotic occlusion of the carotid artery was induced in mongrel dogs by means of a copper coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessel patency was continuously monitored with an electromagnetic flow probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis of the occluded artery was induced by administration of 40 micrograms x kg-1 + 240 micrograms x kg-1 x h-1 rt-PA (low dose) or 80 micrograms x kg-1 + 480 micrograms x kg-1 x h1 rt-PA (high dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With high dose rt-PA treatment, patency was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals within 50 min (range 24 to 75), with low dose rt-PA treatment only in 6 out of 8 animals after 73 min (range 26 to 117) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant administration of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-hirudin (0.3 mg x kg-1 bolus + 0.15 mg x kg-1 x h-1 infusion) increased the incidence of reperfusion in the low dose rt-PA group to 100% while the reperfusion time was shortened from 73 min in the corresponding control group to 38 min (range 20 to 75 min) in the group given <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-hirudin (p = 0.065, Mann-Whitney U-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The carotid artery blood flow, which rapidly declined to zero within 18 to 27 min after discontinuing low or high dose rt-PA infusions remained at a sustained level for the whole observation period of 4 h only in the group given <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-hirudin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one animal reoccluded after 229 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH) given at a dose of 0.3 mg x kg-1 bolus + 0.3 mg x kg-1 x h-1 infusion did not improve the incidence of reperfusion or lower the incidence of reocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Buccal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time was prolonged after high dose rt-PA treatment and after low dose rt-PA with adjunctive UFH- or <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-hirudin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Buccal blood loss was not significantly affected by either treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these experiments indicate that early reocclusion after thrombolysis can effectively be diminished by concomitant treatment with the long acting thrombin inhibitor <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-hirudin with moderate effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time and aPTT </plain></SENT>
