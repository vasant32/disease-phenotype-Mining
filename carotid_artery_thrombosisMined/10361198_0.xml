<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that embolization precedes carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a previously unpredictable event complicating 2-3 per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid endarterectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran 40</z:chebi> therapy might prevent progression to complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 1995 and July 1998, 400 consecutive patients were monitored following carotid endarterectomy using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with sustained embolization (more than 25 in 10 min) or those with emboli that distorted the middle cerebral artery waveform were commenced on an incremental <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran 40</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen patients (54 per cent) had one or more emboli detected (96 per cent within 2 h of flow restoration) but only 15 (4 per cent) required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolization ceased in each case although the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> dose had to be adjusted in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one of the latter patients, embolization recurred on day 5 but was again controlled with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 2 per cent and no patient suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A few patients develop sustained embolization following carotid endarterectomy which, in previous studies, has been shown to be highly predictive of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors' experience to date suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> can stop this phase of embolization and prevent progression to complete carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> has to be adjusted in 25 per cent of patients (i.e. blind administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> may not be effective) and, very rarely, embolization may recur later </plain></SENT>
