<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guinea pig haemostatic mechanisms, such as the platelet thrombin receptor repertoire, resemble those of humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measuring the performance characteristics of marketed antithrombotic drugs in guinea pig models is a key to predicting therapeutic indices of new agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of the current study was to benchmark representative marketed drugs in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and hemostasis models in guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Effects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35544">cyclooxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi>, aspirin, the P2Y(12) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi>, and the direct thrombin inhibitors, argatroban and hirudin, were evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic agents were tested in FeCl(3)-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and arterio-venous shunt <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haemostatic effects of drugs were evaluated in cuticle and renal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo measurements of platelet function and coagulation inhibition were performed to benchmark preclinical doses of each agent to those used clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall rank-order of potency in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models based on per cent of vessels occluded, average carotid blood flow, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight was aspirin=argatroban=<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi>&lt;hirudin=<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> models, the rank order was: aspirin&lt;<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>=argatroban=<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi>&lt;hirudin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This characterization of representative drugs from two important classes of anti-coagulant and anti-platelet agents in efficacy and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> models in guinea pigs provides a reference point for evaluation of new antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
