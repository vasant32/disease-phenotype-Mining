<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rat <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model was developed to assess the efficacity of antithrombotic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It had the following characteristics: controlled hemodynamic and rheological conditions corresponding to arterial flow, a collagen coated surface as a relevant thrombogenic stimulus, a method of measurement allowing dynamic monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and the possibility to assess the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A shunt composed of <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> catheters, including in the middle of the shunt a collagen coated glass capillary, was inserted between the two primitive carotids of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of patency of the shunt was recorded using a thermic probe fixed on its central part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this model, the patency of the shunt was 539 +/- 55 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet and fibrinogen-fibrin accumulation in successive one centimeter segments along the shunt were measured using 111In labeled platelets and 125I labeled fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet accumulation occurred on the collagen coated surface and at the junctions between the different components of the shunt, where flow was disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of four antithrombotic agents were measured: aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and r-hirudin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and hirudin significantly prolonged patency duration of the shunt, whereas aspirin was inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin did not reduce platelet or fibrinogen-fibrin accumulation on the collagen coated surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Platelet accumulation on the collagen surface was significantly lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> group (50 mg/kg) than in the group treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (500 U/kg), demonstrating the direct antiplatelet effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hirudin at doses giving similar values of APTT as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (500 U/kg) prolonged the occlusion time to over 2 h while the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> occlusion time was only 20 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
