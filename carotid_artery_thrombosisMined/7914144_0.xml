<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution made by a stenosed carotid artery to cerebral perfusion is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined blood flow in the internal carotid artery and a comparison was made with the effect of clamping on flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some 50 patients were assessed before carotid endarterectomy by preoperative duplex scanning, triplanar arteriography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At operation, maximal flow in the internal carotid artery was measured using a Doppler flowmeter and flow velocity was monitored by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the degree of stenosis and resting flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean flow in the internal carotid artery in patients with &gt; 90% stenosis was significantly lower than those with lesser stenoses (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a mean minimal blood flow of 141 ml/min passed through the &gt; 90% stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of internal carotid artery clamping on flow velocity was similar irrespective of the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with &gt; 90% stenosis, the internal carotid artery continues to make an important contribution to cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
