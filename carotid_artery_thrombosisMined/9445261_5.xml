<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the effects of current low-dose OC and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, premenopausal and surgically postmenopausal cynomolgus monkeys were divided into four treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Premenopausal monkeys were given either no OCs or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyl estradiol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi> as an OC at a dose equivalent to that currently given to women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postmenopausal monkeys were given either no HRT or conjugated equine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6715">medroxyprogesterone</z:chebi> as an HRT at a dose equivalent to that currently given to women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet containing these treatments for 27 to 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of this time, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was evaluated with a standardized stenosis/injury procedure in the left carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocity was monitored for cyclic or permanent occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current OC and HRT regimens did not increase the susceptibility of the artery wall to develop an occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> following injury and stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fact, there was a reduction in the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the OC animals compared with untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased amounts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were associated with an increased incidence of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
