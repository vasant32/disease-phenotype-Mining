<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>10 min before injury but not by 1.7, 20 or 100 mg/kg and protection was lost by delaying injury to 20 min (Haemostasis 13:42, 1983) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, collagen-induced platelet aggregation and arterial prostacyclin-generating activity, measured by RIA for 6 keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> and by human platelet aggregation bioassay, were studied ex vivo after i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> to anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases where platelet aggregation was inhibited less than 50%, no protection had been observed (1.7 mg/kg at 10 min, 3.3 at 20 min, 20 at 10 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the two cases where protection had been observed, platelet aggregation was inhibited by about 75% or more and in one, prostacyclin activity was about 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (3.3 mg/kg at 10 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus in five of six dose-time combinations tested, antithrombotic protection could be explained by a requirement for about 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> prostacyclin activity and about 75% of inhibition of collagen aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aberrant findings are discussed in the light of knowledge of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi>/aspirin competition for cyclooxygenase </plain></SENT>
