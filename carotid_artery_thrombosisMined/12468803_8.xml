<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to test the hypothesis that intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> is more efficient than intravenous application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were embolized by intracarotid injection of autologous fibrin-rich blood clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hour later rtPA (10 mg/kg) was infused either intravenously (n=8) or intra-arterially (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control rats (n=8) received intra-arterial infusion of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was monitored by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) imaging, and outcome was evaluated by comparing incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and lesion volumes of ATP and pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clot embolism led to a decline of perfusion-weighted imaging signal intensity in the middle cerebral artery territory to &lt;40% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both intra-arterial and intravenous treatment significantly improved blood flow in cerebral cortex but not in caudate putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In untreated animals, ATP and pH lesion volumes were 510.3+/-94.5 and 438.6+/-39.2 mm(3) at 7 hours after clot embolism, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both intravenous and intra-arterial rtPA treatment produced hemorrhagic complications but reduced ATP lesion size to 296.2+/-136.1 and 370.3+/-103.7 mm(3) and reduced pH lesion size to 263.3+/-114.6 and 303.3+/-103.0 mm(3), respectively (P&lt;0.05 for untreated versus treated rats; no difference between intravenous and intra-arterial treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> imaging revealed that lesion reduction was due to inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth but not to reversal of primary injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study documents reduction of injury by rtPA treatment but does not reveal a difference between intra-arterial and intravenous application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support an advantage of intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
