<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this investigation was to develop a reproducible and reliable method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in a small laboratory animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>, and a common carotid artery was exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A completely occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was produced by applying an electric current to the arterial wall (2 mA for 5 min) while simultaneously constricting the artery with a hemostatic clamp placed immediately downstream from the electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete and persistent cessation of blood flow was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the control rats starting 10-15 min after the thrombogenic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed a picture of mixed white and red <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, stratified and rich in platelets aggregates and fibrin, with piles of red cells trapped in the fibrin network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, stasis alone (clamping) was ineffective at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, whereas electric current application alone caused non-occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> only in 30% of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An antithrombotic dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg i.v., 30 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> induction) prevented the formation of a persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, blood flow being progressively restored (up to 59% of basal value within 45 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a thrombolytic dose of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (2 mg/kg, for 120 min, starting 15 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> induction) caused a rapid and progressive resumption of blood flow (up to 80% of basal value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method gives highly consistent and reproducible results and may be suitable for the study or the screening of antithrombotic as well as thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
