<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using a directional Doppler (4 MHz) coupled to a frequency analyser, authors investigate the supra-aortic trunks on 90 patients documented by arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analyser is made of a 16 filter bank system giving a spectrum composed of 16 frequency bands within range of 160 Hz to 4,800 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data analysis is made on a computer using the comparison means test and the discriminant analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Authors compare frequencies on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> common carotid arteries between a group (N = 102) with internal and external carotid arteries free of lesions on one hand, and a group (N = 75) with stenosis or occlusion of internal and/or external carotid arteries on the other hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They don't note any significant difference for each on of the 16 frequency bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of frequencies between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subclavian arteries (N = 115) and subclavian arteries with proximal stenosis or occlusion (N = 24) shows a significant difference concerning the following bands : F12, F14, F15, F16 (p = 0.05), F13 (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of frequencies between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> internal carotid arteries (N = 108) and stenosed internal carotid arteries (N = 57) shows significant difference concerning : F11 (p = 0.05), F7, F8, F9, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16 (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other side, the discriminant function distinguishes a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> internal carotid artery from a stenosed internal carotid artery in 90% of cases, whatever the stenosis degree is </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A discriminant function, added to this analyser, could obtain a frequency analysis easier and less expensive than by fast Fourier transform </plain></SENT>
