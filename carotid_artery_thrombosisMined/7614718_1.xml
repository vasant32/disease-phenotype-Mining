<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numerous mural platelet microthrombi were noted at the distal region of the stenosed arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> 50% stenosis of the carotid artery for 2 weeks, significant intimal thickening was observed, without any occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination with mild denudation was critical in eliciting the effect of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of intimal growth in the stenosed artery was marked by day 6 and plateaued thereafter, whereas it was slight in nonstenosed arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-bromodeoxyuridine index of the cells of the medial layer at day 3 was significantly increased by the stenosis, and the effect was reversed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete reendothelialization of the intimal surface was observed by 7 to 10 days after surgery in the stenosed arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the introduction of stenosis in these arteries enhances the interaction of platelets with the damaged arterial walls under abnormal fluid shear and that this enhancement leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation associated with more marked stenosis as well as to sustained increase of intimal wall thickness in less marked stenosis </plain></SENT>
