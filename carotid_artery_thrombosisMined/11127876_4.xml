<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-AR545C - an S-nitrosoderivative of a recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor fragment AR545C spanning Ala 444 to Asp 730 and containing an Arg 545 Cys mutation, was previously found to inhibit ristocetin- and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation and the interaction of platelets with extracellular matrix (ECM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study we tested the antithrombotic properties of S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-AR545C on guinea pig platelets and in a platelet-rich <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in the guinea pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of guinea pig platelets with 0.1 microM of S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-AR545C decreased ristocetin-induced agglutination by 40% (p = 0.009) and completely abolished <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation (p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At concentration of 1.0 microM, S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-AR545C completely inhibited platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (represented by surface coverage - SC) and decreased aggregate formation (represented by average aggregate size - AS) by more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of guinea pigs with 1.0 mg/kg S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-AR545C resulted in a significantly delayed time to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (31.7+/-6.0 min vs. 13.9+/-3.2 min, p &lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, total patency time was longer in the group injected with S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-AR545C compared to the control group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No change in platelet count, hematocrit and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time was observed 60 min after injection compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a significant decrease in SC (p &lt;0.0001) and AS (p &lt;0.01) were observed 60 min after the injection of S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-AR545C, whereas no change in these parameters was observed in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-AR545C exhibits significant antiadhesive and antiaggregating effects in-vitro and inhibits clot formation in-vivo suggesting that this compound may have potential therapeutic advantages </plain></SENT>
