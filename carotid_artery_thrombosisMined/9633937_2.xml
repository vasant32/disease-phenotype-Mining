<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that the in vivo antithrombotic efficacy of SM-20302, a GP IIb/IIIa receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, correlates with the ex vivo platelet inhibition in heparinized platelet rich plasma (hPRP) but not in citrated PRP (cPRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The studies were performed in a canine model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was induced by electrolytic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the right carotid artery was induced immediately after the administration of saline (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after persistent occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was obtained, the vessel segment was ligated, and the time to occlusion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left carotid artery was initiated in the presence of SM-20302 (100, 300, 600, or 1000 microg/kg i.v.; n=4 to 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the doses of SM-20302 inhibited (by &gt; or = 90%) the ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) in cPRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In hPRP, a dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximal inhibition produced by 100 to 1000 microg/kg SM-20302 ranged from 18% to 80% for <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and 44% to 88% for AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximal prolongation of the template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time induced by the 100-, 300-, 600-, and 1000-microg/kg doses were 2.5-, 9.5-, 10-, and &gt; 10-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the injured carotid arteries (n=12) in the saline-treated group occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SM-20302 pretreatment produced a dose-dependent maintenance of the carotid artery patency, and the incidence of occlusion at 4 hours was 5/6, 3/6, 0/6, and 0/6 for the 100-, 300-, 600-, and 1000-microg/kg doses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that SM-20302 prevents carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in response to electrolytic arterial wall injury and that its in vivo antithrombotic efficacy can be correlated accurately with the ex vivo platelet inhibition in PRP prepared from heparinized blood but not from citrated blood </plain></SENT>
