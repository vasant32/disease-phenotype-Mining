<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study of long-term results (mean follow-up: 10.6 years) in 22 patients operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> between 1962 and 1973 is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most instances, surgery was performed at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of a massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e>, usually more than 8 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (10 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients (22%) died in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight (35%) recovered without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six, the condition improved, while it remained unchanged or worsened in three (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were ten delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, including two from a recurrent cerebrovascular episode and four from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival curve does not differ from that of patients treated conservatively, with rates being 60% at five years, 36% at ten years and 28% at thirteen years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quality of certain postoperative results suggests that surgical indications at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of carotid occlusion be reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of thirty series from the literature (1 046 cases) shows a 17% mortality rate, while 50% of patients recover or improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mortality is significantly lower in recent statistics, under 10%: this improvement may be ascribable to more rigid surgical indications (delay under 6 hours, operation in variable neurologic deficiencies, early diagnosis by the Doppler procedure, better postoperative management) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that surgical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> should no longer be systematically dismissed </plain></SENT>
