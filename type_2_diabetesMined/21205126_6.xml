<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine its effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and pancreas islet function and to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration, in a non-genetic mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Alogliptin (5, 15 and 45 mg/kg) was orally administered to high fat diet/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (HFD/STZ) diabetic mice daily for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postprandial and 6-h fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, blood A1C level, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and pancreas insulin content were measured during or after the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alogliptin plasma concentration was determined by an LC/MS/MS method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and architectural changes were evaluated with immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Islet <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> secretion ability was assessed by measuring insulin release from isolated islets which were challenged with 16 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 30 mM <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiles of the pancreas were analysed using the mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> RT(2) Profiler PCR array which contains 84 genes related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, development and progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Alogliptin showed dose-dependent reduction of postprandial and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and blood A1C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> clearance ability and pancreas insulin content were both increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alogliptin significantly restored the β-cell mass and islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, thus preserving islet function of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of 10 genes including Ins1 was significantly changed in the pancreas of diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> alogliptin treatment completely or partially reversed the abnormalities in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> treatment of alogliptin improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and facilitated restoration of islet architecture and function in HFD/STZ diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profiles suggest that the underlying molecular mechanisms of β-cell protection by alogliptin may involve alleviating endoplasmic reticulum burden and mitochondria <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, increasing β-cell differentiation and proliferation, enhancing islet architecture remodelling and preserving islet function </plain></SENT>
