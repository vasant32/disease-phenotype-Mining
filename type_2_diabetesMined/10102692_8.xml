<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both incretin hormones are rapidly inactivated in plasma by the exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal modification of human GIP to protect from plasma degradation and enhance insulin-releasing and antihyperglycemic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Degradation of GIP by incubation at 37 degrees C with purified DPP IV was clearly evident after 4 h (54% intact) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 h, &gt;60% of GIP was converted to GIP(3-42), whereas &gt;99% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminally modified Tyr1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> GIP remained intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tyr1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> GIP was similarly resistant to serum degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The formation of GIP(3-42) was almost completely abolished by inhibition of plasma DPP IV with diprotin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effects of GIP and Tyr1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> GIP were examined in Wistar rats after intraperitoneal injection of either <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (10 nmol/kg) together with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (18 mmol/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly lower and insulin concentrations higher after both <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, individual <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values at 15 and 30 min together with the areas under the curve (AUCs) for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were significantly lower after administration of Tyr1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> GIP compared with GIP (AUC 255 +/- 33 vs. 368 +/- 8 mmol x l(-1) x min(-1), respectively; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a significantly greater and more protracted insulin response after Tyr1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> GIP than GIP (AUC 773 +/- 41 vs. 639 +/- 39 ng x ml(-1) x min(-1); P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that Tyr1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> GIP displays resistance to plasma DPP IV degradation and exhibits enhanced antihyperglycemic activity and insulin-releasing action in vivo </plain></SENT>
