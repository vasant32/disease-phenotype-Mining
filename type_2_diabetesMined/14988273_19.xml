<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three different PPARs, PPAR-alpha, -gamma, and -delta, have been characterized, and they are distinguished from each other by tissue distribution and cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> PPARs are, to different extents, activated by fatty acids and derivatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been shown that PPAR-delta serves as a widespread regulator of fat burning, suggesting that it might be a potential target in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an effort to identify polymorphic markers in potential candidate genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we have sequenced PPAR-delta, including -1,500 bp of the 5' flanking region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine polymorphisms were identified in PPAR-delta: four in the intron, one in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), and four in the 3' UTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among identified polymorphisms, five common sites, including c.-13454G&gt;T, c.-87T&gt;C, c.2022+12G&gt;A, c.2629T&gt;C, and c.2806C&gt;G, were genotyped in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (n = 702) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genetic associations with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and metabolic phenotype were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant associations with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, several positive associations of PPAR-delta polymorphisms with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and BMI were detected in nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The genetic information about PPAR-delta from this study would be useful for further genetic study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
