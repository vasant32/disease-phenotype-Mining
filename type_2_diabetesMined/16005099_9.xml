<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prescribed exercise was walking for 45-60 min three times weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control group of 26 patients from a neighboring primary care clinic, aged 59.3+/-6.2 years, received no exercise instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, randomization was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no improvements of blood pressure, body mass index, physical fitness, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin by intention-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients in the intervention group increased their physical activity and improved systolic blood pressure; -7.6 mmHg (-15 to -0.2), diastolic blood pressure; -4.3 mmHg (-7.4 to -1.2), body mass index; -0.6 kg/m2 (-1.1 to -0.1) and total plasma cholesterol; -0.6 mmol/l (-0.9 to -0.3), (mean difference, with 95% CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could observe no effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that an increase of regular physical activity equivalent to 45 min of walking 3 days/week may suffice to improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and BMI in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
