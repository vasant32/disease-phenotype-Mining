<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin is an adipose-specific plasma protein whose plasma concentrations are decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein possesses putative antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we have analyzed the relationship between adiponectin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), which spontaneously develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and which subsequently frequently progress to overt type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of adiponectin were decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and diabetic monkeys as in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prospective longitudinal studies revealed that the plasma levels of adiponectin declined at an early phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and remained decreased after the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies revealed that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> monkeys with lower plasma adiponectin showed significantly lower insulin-stimulated peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (M rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of adiponectin were significantly correlated to M rate (r = 0.66, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longitudinally, the plasma adiponectin decreased in parallel to the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No clear association was found between the plasma levels of adiponectin and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that reduction in circulating adiponectin may be related to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
