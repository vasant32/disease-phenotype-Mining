<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> compared with placebo in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (2,000 or 2,500 mg/day in divided doses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study had a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group comparison design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The trial lasted 31 weeks and consisted of a 1-week screening period, a 6-week placebo pretreatment period, and a 24-week period of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> or placebo, with a forced titration from 25-50 mg t.i.d. and a titration of 50-100 mg tid that was based on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary efficacy variables included mean changes from baseline in fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> to patients on background <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and diet therapy showed a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA1c of 0.65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were statistically significant reductions in fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin levels compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal side effects were more frequently reported in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in liver transaminase elevations were observed between patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> and those treated with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and diet is safe and generally well tolerated and that it significantly lowers HbA1c and fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
