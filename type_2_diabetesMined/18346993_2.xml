<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aim to correlate the incidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> requiring laser treatment with the control of risk factors in the diabetic population of Tayside, Scotland, for the years 2001-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> laser treatment, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> screening, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care databases were linked for calendar years 2001-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were the numbers of patients undergoing first or any laser treatment for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean A1C and blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> screening rates were followed over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 6 years, the number of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Tayside increased from 9,694 to 15,207 (57% increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of patients receiving laser treatment decreased from 222 to 138 and first laser treatments decreased from 100 (1.03% of diabetic population) to 56 (0.37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> decreased from 180 in 2001 to 103 in 2006 (43% reduction, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean A1C decreased for type 1 and type 2 diabetic populations (P &lt; 0.01) and a reduction in blood pressure was observed in type 2 diabetic patients (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of patients attending annual digital photographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> screening increased from 3,012 to 11,932 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laser treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic maculopathy</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients has decreased in Tayside over a six-year period, despite an increased prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and increased screening effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that earlier identification of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and improved risk factor control has reduced the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> severe enough to require laser treatment </plain></SENT>
