<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given the enormous public health and economic burden posed by the global epidemic of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), intervention in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> stage of disease to prevent progression to T2DM and its vascular complications seems the most sensible approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Precisely how best to intervene remains the subject of much debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prudent lifestyle changes have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of progression in individuals with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although lifestyle modifications are notoriously difficult to maintain, there is evidence that intensive intervention results in continued preventive benefit after the stopping of structured counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of drug therapies, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, orlistat and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, have also been proven effective in preventing progression from IFG/IGT, but unresolved issues still remain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, whether large numbers of individuals with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dysregulation who may never progress to T2DM should be exposed to the risk of pharmacological adverse effects is a topic of discussion and debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there are limited data on the effectiveness of implementing interventions during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic state</z:e> to prevent cardiovascular complications that may be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A recent American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) consensus statement on IFG/IGT recommends lifestyle modification for individuals with IFG or IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note, the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> consensus statement introduces the option of adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment to lifestyle changes in those individuals who have combined IFG/IGT plus an additional risk factor for progression and who also have some features that increase the likelihood of benefiting from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are a new class of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents that, in addition to being effective in improving glycaemic control, may exert beneficial effects in preserving beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These characteristics, combined with a low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, weight neutrality and what appears - so far - to be a relatively benign tolerability profile, make these agents intriguing candidates for preventive treatment </plain></SENT>
