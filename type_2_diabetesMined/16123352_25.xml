<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular remodeling, characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_178'>extracellular matrix deposition</z:mpath> and an increased media-to-lumen ratio, occurs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and contributes to the development of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced changes in the cerebrovascular structure remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor with profibrotic properties, is chronically elevated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-mediated changes in the cerebrovasculature and the role of ET-1 in this process, type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were administered an ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral arteries were harvested and studies were performed to determine vascular structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue and plasma ET-1 levels were increased in GK rats compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant medial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and collagen deposition resulted in an increased wall-to-lumen ratio in diabetic rats that was reduced by ET(A) receptor antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity was higher, but MMP-1 levels were significantly reduced in GK rats, and MMP levels were restored to control levels by ET(A) receptor antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ET-1 promotes cerebrovascular remodeling in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through differential regulation of MMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Augmented cerebrovascular remodeling may contribute to an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and ET(A) receptor antagonism may offer a novel therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
