<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an observational cohort study of 668 patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into three groups by sex-specific tertile of leptin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measurements were the rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and progression to a more advanced stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with low or high leptin levels had a steeper eGFR decline (-2.07 and -2.14 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year) than those with midrange leptin levels (-0.82 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year; P &lt; 0.01), whereas patients with low leptin levels had an elevated risk of progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> as compared with those with high leptin levels (hazard ratio 3.125 [95% CI 1.302-7.499]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both low and high serum leptin levels were risk factors for kidney function decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, lower serum leptin levels were associated with progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
