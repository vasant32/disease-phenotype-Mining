<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care interventions have been more effective at improving glycemic control in those with lower educational attainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to limited resources, the focus has shifted to brief, cost-effective health interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether educational attainment moderates the effect of a brief, telephone delivered self-care intervention on glycemic control in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomized clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants (N=62) were assigned to receive treatment as usual or treatment as usual plus a brief telephone intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant education by intervention group interaction effect indicated that participants with higher educational attainment had greater improvement in glycemic control (A1c) than those with less educational attainment; whereas, educational attainment was unrelated to change in glycemic control (A1c) within the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: People with higher educational attainment may benefit to a greater extent from brief self-care interventions for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while those with lower educational attainment may require more intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
