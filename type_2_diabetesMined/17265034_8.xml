<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 2,838 patients, who were aged 40 to 75 years and had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without a documented history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and without elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, were recruited from 32 centres in the UK and Ireland and randomly allocated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 10 mg daily (n = 1,428) or placebo (n = 1,410) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These subjects were followed-up for a median period of 3.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct treatment costs and effectiveness were analysed to provide estimates of cost per endpoint-free year over the trial period for alternative definitions of endpoint, and of cost per life-year gained and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a patient's lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the trial period, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be 7,608 pounds per year free of any CARDS primary endpoint; the ICER was calculated to be 4,896 pounds per year free of any cardiovascular endpoint and 4,120 pounds per year free of any study endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over lifetime, the incremental cost per life-year gained was 5,107 pounds and the cost per QALY was 6,471 pounds (costs and benefits both discounted at 3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> is a cost-effective intervention in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with the ICER for this intervention falling within the current acceptance threshold ( 20,000 pounds per QALY) specified by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) </plain></SENT>
