<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used a novel and specific radioimmunoassay to detect glycated insulin in plasma of Type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 102 Type 2 diabetic patients in three main categories: those with good glycaemic control with a HbA(1c) less than 7%, moderate glycaemic control (HbA(1c) 7-9%) and poor glycaemic control (HBA(1c) greater than 9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used 75 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic subjects as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were analysed for HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma concentrations of glycated insulin and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycated insulin was readily detected in control and Type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean circulating concentration of glycated insulin in control subjects was 12.6+/-0.9 pmol/l ( n=75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glycated insulin in the good, moderate and poorly controlled diabetic groups was increased 2.4-fold ( p&lt;0.001, n=44), 2.2-fold ( p&lt;0.001, n=41) and 1.1-fold ( n=17) corresponding to 29.8+/-5.4, 27.3+/-5.7 and 13.5+/-2.9 pmol/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Glycated insulin circulates at noticeably increased concentrations in Type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
