<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism in the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) gene (HSLi6) is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although it is unknown whether the polymorphism is functional and thereby influences lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 355 apparently healthy nonobese male and female subjects for the HSLi6 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allele 5 was found to be the most common allele (allele frequency 0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 117 of the subjects, we measured abdominal subcutaneous fat cell lipolysis induced by drugs acting at various steps in the lipolytic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lipolysis rate induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> (acting on beta-adrenoceptors), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> (acting on adenylyl cyclase), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cyclic AMP</z:chebi> (acting on HSL) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decreased by approximately 50% in allele 5 homozygotes, as compared with noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heterozygotes showed an intermediate lipolytic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in lipolysis rate between genotypes was more pronounced in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that allele 5 of the HSLi6 polymorphism is associated with a marked decrease in the lipolytic rate of abdominal fat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may in turn contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
