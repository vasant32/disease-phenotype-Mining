<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective subgroup analyses were performed on pooled data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> completed nateglinide studies (12 randomized, double blind trials and 1 open trial) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,702 patients with &gt; or =1 postbaseline safety evaluation received monotherapy with nateglinide (n = 2,204), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 436), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (n = 293), or placebo (n = 769) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy (HbA(1c)) was evaluated in pooled data from four studies with similar design using 120 mg nateglinide (n = 544) versus placebo (n = 521) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluations were performed in the overall population and subgroups of patients over age 64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific considerations were given to RI, comorbidity, and baseline HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients over age 64 years (n = 1,170) represented 31.6% of the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Undiagnosed RI was common in the elderly with 83.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients being in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients over 64 years with RI had a higher prevalence of cardio- and microvascular comorbidity compared with the overall population and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients over age 64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant HbA(1c) reductions versus placebo were observed with nateglinide in patients over age 64 years and elderly with RI patients at study end point (-0.9% and -1.1% in each subgroup, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide was well tolerated with a low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups, including those with RI and low baseline HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RI and comorbidity are common in patients over age 64 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide was effective and well tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In subgroups in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and long-acting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> must be used with caution, nateglinide had a low risk of adverse events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
