<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether previously reported muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and altered gene transcript levels in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might be secondary to abnormal blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels rather than an intrinsic defect of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 type 2 diabetic and 17 nondiabetic subjects were studied on two separate occasions while maintaining similar insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in both groups by 7-h infusions of somatostatin, low- or high-dose insulin (0.25 and 1.5 mU/kg of fat-free mass per min, respectively), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA abundance was not different between type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects at both insulin levels, but the majority of transcripts in muscle that are involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> functions were expressed at lower levels in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at low levels of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, several gene transcripts that are specifically involved in the electron transport chain were expressed at higher levels in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the low-dose insulin infusion, which achieved postabsorptive insulin levels, the muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production rate (MAPR) was not different between type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, increasing insulin to postprandial levels increased the MAPR in nondiabetic subjects but not in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of MAPR increment in response to high-dose insulin in type 2 diabetic patients occurred in association with reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the current data supports that muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not an intrinsic defect, but instead a functional defect related to impaired response to insulin </plain></SENT>
