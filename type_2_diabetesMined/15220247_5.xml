<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of fixed-dose trandolapril-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (FDTV) with that of trandolapril on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in normotensive, type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 60 normotensive, type 2 diabetic patients with 24-h <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> &gt;300 mg were randomly assigned to two groups for open-label treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One group received 2 mg trandolapril/180 mg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> FDTV once daily; the other group received 2 mg trandolapril once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study drugs were administered for 6 months in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">Creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and 24-h urinary protein excretion were measured at the beginning and the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated monthly for blood pressure, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, heart rate, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups experienced a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.005) mean decrease in mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> from baseline: FDTV ([mean +/- SD] 1200 +/- 200 to 540 +/- 79 mg; P &lt; 0.001) and trandolapril (1,105 +/- 212 to 750.9 +/- 134 mg; P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater reduction from baseline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> was observed in the FDTV group compared with the trandolapril group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who received trandolapril experienced a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (91.1 +/- 3.4 to 75.3 +/- 3 ml/min; P &lt; 0.05) compared with patients who received FDTV (88.3 +/- 3.6 to 82.9 +/- 3.5 ml/min; P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Final fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly lower in the FDTV group (139 +/- 19) compared with the trandolapril group (154 +/- 22; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between the two groups in mean baseline or final measurements of blood pressure, mean heart rate, or frequency of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FDTV is more effective than trandolapril in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in normotensive, type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> is not related with blood pressure reduction </plain></SENT>
