<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of DR with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and CV events in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by a systematic review and meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The electronic databases Medline and Embase were searched for cohort studies that evaluated DR in type 2 or type 1 diabetic patients and reported total mortality and/or fatal and nonfatal CV events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, coronary artery bypass graft, ischemic changes on a conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or lower leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data extraction was performed by two reviewers independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled effect estimates were obtained by using random-effects meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis included 20 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, providing data from 19,234 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 14,896), the presence of any degree of DR increased the chance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and/or CV events by 2.34 (95% CI 1.96-2.80) compared with patients without DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 4,438), the corresponding odds ratio was 4.10 (1.50-11.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations remained after adjusting for traditional CV risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DR was also predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 2.41 [1.87-3.10]) and type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (3.65 [1.05-12.66]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of DR was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and CV events in both type 2 and type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
