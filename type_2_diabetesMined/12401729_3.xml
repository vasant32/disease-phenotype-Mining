<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The KCNJ10 gene is located within a region on chromosome 1q linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Pima Indians and six other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated this gene as a potential type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> candidate gene in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KCNJ10 consists of two exons, spans approximately 33 kb, and we identified eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one (SNP2) in the coding region leading to a Glu359Lys substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association studies were carried out in a case-control group composed of 149 affected and 150 unaffected Pimas, and the linkage analysis was performed in a linkage set of 1,338 Pimas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNP1 in the promoter and SNP2 in the intron, which were in a complete linkage disequilibrium, and SNP5 in the 3' untranslated region showed association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the case-control group (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When genotyped in the linkage set, only the KCNJ10-SNP1 variant showed a modest association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KCNJ10-SNP1 is in a strong linkage disquilibrium with SNP14 of the adjacent KCNJ9 locus, which we previously found to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for KCNJ10-SNP1, the original linkage score at this locus was marginally reduced from 3.1 to 2.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that these variants in KCNJ10 are unlikely to be the cause of linkage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with 1q in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
