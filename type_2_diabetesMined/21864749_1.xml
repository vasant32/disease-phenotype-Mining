<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This difference has been attributed to gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> GLP-1 and GIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since incretin effect is reduced in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, despite GLP-1 activity preservation, two forms of incretin-based treatment have emerged: GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, administered subcutaneously and DPP-4 inhibitors, administered orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is a great interest whether incretin-based treatment will be associated with sustained long-term control and improvement in Î²-cell function </plain></SENT>
