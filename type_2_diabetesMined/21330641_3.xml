<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, including 43,176 Chinese men and women (aged 45-74 years), free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline (1993-1998) and followed up through 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two major dietary patterns were identified using principal components analysis: a vegetable, fruit, and soy-rich pattern (VFS) and a dim sum and meat-rich pattern (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pattern scores for each participant were calculated and examined with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The associations of the two dietary patterns with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk were modified by smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither pattern was associated with risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in ever smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In never smokers, the VFS dietary pattern was inversely associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the lowest quintile of the VFS dietary pattern score, the hazard ratios (HRs) for quintiles 2-5 were 0.91, 0.82, 0.73, and 0.75 (P = 0.0005 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> dietary pattern was positively associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in never smokers, with HRs for quintiles 2-5 of 1.07, 1.25, 1.18, and 1.47 (P &lt; 0.0001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A dietary pattern with higher intake of vegetables, fruits, and soy foods was inversely associated with risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and a pattern with higher intake of dim sum, meat and processed meat, sweetened foods and beverages, and fried foods was associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese men and women in Singapore </plain></SENT>
