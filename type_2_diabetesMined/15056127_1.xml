<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Outpatients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were recruited at Niigata University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was calculated by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LVH was considered to be present if the LVMI was &gt; 131 g/m(2) in males and &gt; 100 g/m(2) in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with LVH received a low dose (40 mg/day) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This low dose had no clinical effect on blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 38 patients who entered the study, 14 (36.8%) had LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After only 6 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> therapy, the mean LVMI decreased significantly, from 126.5 +/- 27.8 to 119.0 +/- 23.5 g/m(2) (p &lt; 0.01 vs. baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, a significant decrease was observed after 12 months (116.5 +/- 30.9 g/m(2), p &lt; 0.05 vs. baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to baseline, there were no significant differences after treatment in body mass index, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)), systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients with LVH, treatment with a low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, for 12 months, reduced LVMI, with no reduction in systemic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This drug may be safely administered to type 2 diabetic patients with LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The long-term risk-reduction effects will have to be evaluated in further trials </plain></SENT>
