<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)-3 is a natural inhibitor of cytokine signalling and also influences insulin signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SOCS3 could therefore be a candidate gene in the development of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mutation analysis of the SOCS3 gene was performed in 21 patients with Type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and in seven healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An identified promoter variant was examined in (i) 250 families with Type 1 diabetic family members (1097 individuals); (ii) 212 glucose-tolerant first-degree relatives of Type 2 diabetic patients; and (iii) 370 population-based young, healthy subjects who were unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three mutations were identified in the promoter region, but none in the coding region or the 3'UTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the three mutations had allele frequencies below 1% whereas the C -920--&gt;A substitution had a minor allele frequency of 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group of young healthy subjects the insulin sensitivity index was higher among homozygous carriers of the A-allele than among heterozygous and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> subjects ( p=0.027, uncorrected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same trend was found in the group of first-degree relatives of Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association or linkage was found to Type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Homozygosity for the A-allele of the C -920--&gt;A promoter polymorphism of the SOCS3 gene may be associated with increased whole-body insulin sensitivity, but deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
