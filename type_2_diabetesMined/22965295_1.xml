<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, while in vivo only very small amounts of GLP-1 reach the pancreas in bioactive form, some observations indicate that GLP-1 may also be produced in the islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed comprehensive morphological, functional and molecular studies to evaluate the presence and various features of a local GLP-1 system in human pancreatic islet cells, including those from type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The presence of insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, proconvertase (PC) 1/3 and PC2 was determined in human pancreas by immunohistochemistry with confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Islets were isolated from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 protein abundance was evaluated by immunoblotting and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single alpha and beta cell suspensions were obtained by enzymatic dissociation and FACS sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glucagon and GLP-1 release were measured in response to nutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Confocal microscopy showed the presence of GLP-1-like and PC1/3 immunoreactivity in subsets of alpha cells, whereas GLP-1 was not observed in beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of GLP-1 in isolated islets was confirmed by immunoblotting, followed by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Isolated islets and alpha (but not beta) cell fractions released GLP-1, which was regulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PC1/3 (also known as PCSK1) gene expression was shown in alpha cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 release was significantly higher from type 2 diabetic than from non-diabetic isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have shown the presence of a functionally competent GLP-1 system in human pancreatic islets, which resides in alpha cells and might be modulated by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
