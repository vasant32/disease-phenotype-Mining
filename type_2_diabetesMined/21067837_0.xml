<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the efficacy of continuing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in combination with basal-prandial insulin therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An open crossover study was performed with arms of discontinuation and continuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in 25 subjects with mean <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 17 years and 5 years of insulin treatment combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At entry and at the end of each 3-month arm, meal tolerance tests were performed for measurements of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In terms of between-treatment differences (discontinuation vs. continuation arm of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>) during meal tolerance tests performed at the ends of arms, significant increases in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were seen on the discontinuation arm at 0-, 30-, and 60-min, while significant decreases in serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were observed at 60- and 120-min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C values of the discontinuation arm significantly increased (from 6.6 ± 0.6 at baseline to 7.7 ± 0.8 at 3-months, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increases in A1C were closely correlated with decreases in area under the curve of meal-stimulated serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (r=-0.61, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since endogenous insulin secretion is more physiological than subcutaneous insulin injection, continuing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> may remain beneficial, partly through enhancing insulin secretion, in individuals with a long duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and basal-prandial insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
