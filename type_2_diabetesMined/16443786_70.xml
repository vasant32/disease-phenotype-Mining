<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to elucidate how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> improves endothelial functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) to clinically relevant concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (50-500 micromol/l) dose-dependently increased serine-1179 (Ser1179) phosphorylation (equal to human Ser1179) of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthase (eNOS) as well as its association with heat shock protein (hsp)-90, resulting in increased activation of eNOS and NO bioactivity (cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were mimicked or completely abrogated by adenoviral overexpression of a constitutively active 5'-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated kinase (AMPK) mutant or a kinase-inactive AMPK-alpha, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as well as 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22512">aminoimidazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18254">ribonucleoside</z:chebi>, an AMPK <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, significantly increased eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation, NO bioactivity, and coimmunoprecipitation of eNOS with hsp90 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> C57BL6 mice but not in AMPK-alpha1 knockout mice, suggesting that AMPK is required for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-enhanced eNOS activation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, incubation of BAECs with clinically relevant concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> dramatically attenuated high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (30 mmol/l)-induced reduction in the association of hsp90 with eNOS, which resulted in increased NO bioactivity with a reduction in overexpression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> caused by high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> might improve vascular endothelial functions in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by increasing AMPK-dependent, hsp90-mediated eNOS activation </plain></SENT>
