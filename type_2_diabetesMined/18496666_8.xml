<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The RBP4 -803GA promoter polymorphism influences binding of hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha and is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that the RBP4 -803GA polymorphism increases type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk at a population-based level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, information on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> intake and plasma vitamin A levels enabled us to explore the possible underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the Rotterdam Study, a prospective, population-based, follow-up study, the -803GA polymorphism was genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazards models, associations of the -803GA polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> intake with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the interaction of the polymorphism with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> intake on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of participants the association of the polymorphism and vitamin A plasma levels was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Homozygous carriers of the -803A allele had increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 1.83; 95% CI 1.26-2.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">Retinol</z:chebi> intake was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and showed no interaction with the RBP4 -803GA polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no significant association of the polymorphism with plasma vitamin A levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results provide evidence that homozygosity for the RBP4 -803A allele is associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Rotterdam population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This relationship was not clearly explained by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> intake and vitamin A plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we cannot differentiate between a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-dependent or -independent mechanism of this RBP4 variant </plain></SENT>
