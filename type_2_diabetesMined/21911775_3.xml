<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To address whether <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, and in particular 1-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, may affect diastolic function in 161 never-treated hypertensive white subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired left ventricular relaxation, an early sign of diastolic dysfunction, represents the first manifestation of myocardial involvement in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value ≥155 mg/dL for the 1-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) is able to identify subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and with subclinical organ damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects underwent OGTT and standard echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diastolic function was assessed by pulsed Doppler transmitral flow velocity and tissue Doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by Matsuda index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the participants, 120 had NGT, 26 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and 15 had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the 1-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cutoff point of 155 mg/dL, we divided NGT subjects as follows: NGT &lt;155 mg/dL (n = 90) and NGT ≥155 mg/dL (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with NGT ≥155 mg/dL had higher left atrium dimensions (P &lt; 0.0001) and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) (P = 0.037) than those with NGT &lt;155 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, early/late transmitral flow velocity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissue Doppler parameters were significantly lower in those with NGT ≥155 mg/dL than in those with NGT&lt;155 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At multiple regression analysis, 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was the major determinant of left atrium area, IVRT, septal e', septal e'-to-a' ratio, lateral e', and lateral e'-to-a' ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of this study is that 1-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subjects with NGT ≥155 mg/dL had significantly worse diastolic function than those with NGT&lt;155 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
