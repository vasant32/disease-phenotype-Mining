<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were randomly assigned to Group A (intensive insulin treatment) or Group B (conventional insulin treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before treatment and 2 weeks after plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations had been maintained at the specified concentrations, blood samples were obtained to measure serum adiponectin and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 21 patients were randomized to each Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adiponectin, NO, endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDD), and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EID) measures were significantly higher post-treatment than pre-treatment in Group A (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only EID was significantly higher in Group B (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment adiponectin and NO concentrations, and EDD were significantly higher in Group A compared with Group B (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both treatment regimens were well tolerated (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients completed the study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse event was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, early intensive insulin therapy can increase serum adiponectin and NO concentrations and improve endothelial function in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These effects may underlie the reduced incidence of microvascular and macrovascular in patients who receive early intensive hypoglycemic therapy </plain></SENT>
