<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Towards this aim we studied two groups of diabetic persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1: n = 30 lean (mean age 57.2+/-12.5 years, body mass index (BMI) 22.5+/-1.8 kg/m2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 2: n = 35 overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (age 52.3+/-10.3 years, BMI 28.8 + 3.2 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (DAN) was assessed using the battery of the five classical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DAN was diagnosed when at least two of the five tests were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>Abnormalities of the heart</z:hpo> rate based tests were considered as indication of parasympathetic and of blood pressure changes as indication of sympathetic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates of DAN were not different between group 2 and group 1 (54.2 and 53.3%, respectively, P = 0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same was valid for the rates of parasympathetic and sympathetic dysfunction in the studied groups (51.4 and 53.3% (P = 0.87) in group 2 and 34.2 and 33.3% (P = 0.93) in group 1, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the values of the arithmetic expression of each single autonomic function test were compared, no significant difference could be shown between the studied groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, no significant correlation was found between BMI and indices of DAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that moderate increase of body mass does not affect autonomic function in persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
