<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: It has recently been shown that polymorphisms of some genes might influence the genetic susceptibility to complex, multifactorial forms of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of those genes is peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PPARgamma gene product is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates adipogenesis and is a target for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, medications enhancing sensitivity to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Pro12Ala amino acid variant of the PPARgamma2 isoform is associated with T2DM in several populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIMS: (1) To determine the allele and genotype frequency of the Pro12Ala PPARgamma2 amino acid variant in a Polish population; (2) To search for the association of the Pro12Ala polymorphism with T2DM in the examined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 644 individuals in this study: 366 T2DM patients with age of diagnosis greater than 35 years and 278 non-diabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fragment of the PPARgamma2 gene which contains the examined amino acid variant was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alleles and genotypes were determined based on electrophoresis of the DNA digestion products by the specific restriction enzyme BshI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in distribution between the groups were examined by chi2 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of Pro/Ala alleles was similar in T2DM patients and in the control subjects (83.5%/16.5% vs. 84.5%/15.5%, respectively, P=0.607) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no difference between the groups when we analysed the genotype distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stratification analyses based on age of diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), and family history of T2DM were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Pro/Ala and Ala/Ala genotypes tended to be more frequent in T2DM cases with age of diagnosis &gt;50 years than in controls (36.2% vs. 27.3%, P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This difference was not significant after Sheffe correction for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The other stratification analyses did not show any difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The frequency of the Pro12Ala PPARgamma2 polymorphism in the Polish population studied is similar to that in other Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the case-control study, we were not able to confirm earlier reports that the Pro allele conferred an increased risk for development of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results of the stratified analysis suggest an opposite trend in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> T2DM </plain></SENT>
