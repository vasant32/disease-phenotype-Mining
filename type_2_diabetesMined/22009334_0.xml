<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this effect in vivo we studied skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory capacity and content from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 14) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (n = 8) and healthy control (n = 18) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory capacity was measured ex vivo in permeabilised muscle fibres obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The respiratory response to in vitro titration with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was measured in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">Citrate</z:chebi> synthase (CS) activity, and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and HbA(1c) levels were measured and body composition was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants were matched for age, BMI and percentage body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were higher (p &lt; 0.05) in those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CS activity was comparable between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated and control participants, but tended to be lower in those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory capacity with substrates for complex I and complex I and II was comparable in the groups, both when estimated per mg of tissue and when normalised to CS activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> titration demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on complex I and II in human skeletal muscle at suprapharmacological concentrations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of complex I and II respiration in controls was demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> titration in vitro at doses well above those observed during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
