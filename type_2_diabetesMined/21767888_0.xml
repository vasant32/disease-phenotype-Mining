<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of unmet needs exist with traditional T2DM therapies, which can lead to insufficient glycaemic control and increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An emerging class of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapeutics, the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, appear to address many of the unmet needs of patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review summarises the recent findings and current clinical guidelines of the currently approved GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and explores the new GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also concentrates on the physiological basis for early use of GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, their use as an alternative to insulin therapy, the rationale for combining them with insulin and their cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
