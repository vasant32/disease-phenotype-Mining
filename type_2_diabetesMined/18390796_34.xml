<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 71,346 female nurses aged 38-63 years who were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1984 were followed for 18 years, and dietary information was collected using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was self-reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 4,529 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented, and the cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 7.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase of three servings/day in total fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio 0.99 [95% CI 0.94-1.05]), whereas the same increase in whole fruit consumption was associated with a lower hazard of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.82 [0.72-0.94]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase of 1 serving/day in green leafy vegetable consumption was associated with a modestly lower hazard of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.91 [0.84-0.98]), whereas the same change in fruit juice intake was associated with an increased hazard of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.18 [1.10-1.26]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of green leafy vegetables and fruit was associated with a lower hazard of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas consumption of fruit juices may be associated with an increased hazard among women </plain></SENT>
