<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the triangular association between MIF genotypes, circulating MIF concentrations and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and to use a Mendelian randomisation approach to assess the causal role of MIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a case-cohort design within the population-based MONICA/KORA Augsburg Study, based on 502 individuals with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (293 men, 209 women) and 1,632 non-cases (859 men, 773 women), we determined MIF serum levels at baseline and genotyped four MIF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The C allele of SNP rs1007888 (3.8 kb 3' of the translation termination codon) was associated with increased circulating MIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MIF genotype rs1007888CC was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women [hazard ratio (95% CI) 1.74 (1.02-2.97)], but not in men [1.17 (0.75-1.81)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated MIF serum levels were associated with higher type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk also only in women [HR (95% CI) 1.95 (1.15-3.29) comparing extreme quartiles after multiple adjustment], but not in men (p for interaction 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between MIF levels and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women (111 cases, 147 non-cases) compared with non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women (98 cases, 626 non-cases; p for BMI interaction 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The consistent triangular relationship between genotypes, serum levels and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women indicates that MIF may play a causal role in the aetiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that elevated MIF levels confer a higher disease risk </plain></SENT>
