<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs without gaining sufficient glycaemic control were included in this three-period study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with a short-acting insulin analogue, 2 IU/h, for 8 h during three consecutive nights (period A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based upon the results from period A, two additional dose regimens of three nights (period B and C) were studied in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin aspart, human insulin and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) profiles were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In period A, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) was reduced from a mean +/- s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(mmol/l) value of 11.6 +/- 2.9 to 5.5 +/- 1.6 (p &lt; 0.0001) during the first night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No additional lowering of FPG was seen the two succeeding nights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FPG narrowed as the range before the infusion was 7.3-15.2 mmol/l compared with 3.6-6.1 mmol/l on the last morning after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The variability in PG profile during the first and the last night of CSII was small and not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rising insulin aspart was mirrored by a decrease in human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In period B and C, similar tendencies as for period A were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In period A, two patients each experienced one mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episode</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CSII with an insulin analogue overnight effectively reduced FPG without occurrence of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients who fail to achieve glycaemic control on oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
