<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to determine the validity of the Toronto Clinical Scoring System (CSS) in reflecting the presence and severity of diabetic peripheral sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (DSP) as determined by myelinated fiber density (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>) on sural nerve biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ascertained from a large therapeutic randomized controlled trial, were included in this cross-sectional, observational cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphological severity of DSP was expressed as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> in the sural nerve biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Toronto CSS was applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to determine a clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>General linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between the morphological severity of DSP and the Toronto CSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Toronto CSS showed a significant negative correlation with sural nerve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> (R(2) = 0.256, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Toronto CSS was lower in those with better glycemic control (HbA(1c) &lt;/=8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sural nerve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> and the Toronto CSS showed strong correlations with electrophysiology, by both summed amplitude and summed conduction velocity values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Toronto CSS is a valid instrument to reflect the presence and severity of DSP as measured by sural nerve <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study underscore the interrelationships between clinical deficits, electrophysiological findings, and morphological changes in DSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This evidence suggests that the Toronto CSS may prove useful in documenting and monitoring DSP in the clinic and in clinical research trials </plain></SENT>
