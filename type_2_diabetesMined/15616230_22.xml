<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is a well-documented gap between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care guidelines and the services received by patients in most health care settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report presents 12-month follow-up results from a computer-assisted, patient-centered intervention to improve the level of recommended services patients received from a variety of primary care settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 886 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under the care of 52 primary care physicians participated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Priority Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians were stratified and randomized to intervention or control conditions and evaluated on two primary outcomes: number of recommended laboratory screenings and recommended patient-centered care activities completed from the National Committee on Quality Assurance/American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association Provider Recognition Program (PRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were evaluated using the Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> 2 quality of life scale, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and HbA1c levels, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The program was well implemented and significantly improved both the number of laboratory assays and patient-centered aspects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care patients received compared with those in the control condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was overall improvement on secondary outcomes of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, HbA1c, quality of life, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores; between-condition differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Staff in small, mixed-payer primary care offices can consistently implement a patient-centered intervention to improve PRP measures of quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternative explanations for why these process improvements did not lead to improved outcomes, and suggested directions for future research are discussed </plain></SENT>
