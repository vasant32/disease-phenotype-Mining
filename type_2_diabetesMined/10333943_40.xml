<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The development of specific assays allows the different molecules in the proinsulin processing pathway to be measured separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>32,33 Split proinsulin is the predominant form of proinsulin and accounts for the disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia seen in individuals with prevalent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was established to examine whether the concentration of this molecule predicts <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based longitudinal cohort study was conducted in Ely, Cambridgeshire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 1,122 individuals completed a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the 4.5-year follow-up study, repeat OGTTs were performed on 937 of the cohort of 1,071 individuals who had been nondiabetic at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 26 people progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as determined by the OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of progression was strongly related to the fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (relative risk [RR] comparing top with bottom quartile 17.6 [95% CI 2.4-130.4]) and fasting 32,33 split proinsulin (RR 16.4 [2.2-121.9]), but less strongly to the fasting insulin (RR 4.41 [1.5-12.9]) or intact proinsulin (RR 5.2 [1.5-17.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, these associations were independent of age, sex, BMI, and baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the top quartile for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and total proinsulin with a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were a high-risk subgroup (incidence 65.8 per 1,000 person-years of follow-up [pyfu]); 30% of them progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fasting 32,33 split proinsulin independently predicts the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This prediction was better than that observed for either the insulin or intact proinsulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combination of family history, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and total proinsulin identified a subgroup of individuals at high risk of progression who might benefit from targeted interventions </plain></SENT>
