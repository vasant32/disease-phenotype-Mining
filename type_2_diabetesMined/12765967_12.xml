<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mice double heterozygous (DH) for deletion of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 are lean, insulin resistant, and have a phenotype that strongly depends on the genetic background of the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the C57BL/6 (B6) background, DH mice develop marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas on the 129S6 background, DH mice exhibit only mild elevations of insulin and remain free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>F2 male mice created by an intercross between these two strains exhibit a 60% incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a bell-shaped distribution of insulin levels as related to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, reminiscent of that in humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mice also exhibit a wide range of leptin levels as related to body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide scan of F2 mice reveals a quantitative trait locus (QTL) related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> on chromosome 14 (D14Mit55) with a peak logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 5.6, accounting for up to 69% of this trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A QTL with a LOD score of 3.7 related to hyperleptinemia is present on chromosome 7 at D12Mit38 (a marker previously assigned to chromosome 12) in the area of the uncoupling protein 2/3 gene cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This locus also interacts synergistically with D14Mit55 in development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and with a QTL on chromosome 12 (D12Mit231) related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate how multiple genetic modifiers can interact and influence the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the phenotype of animals with genetically programmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and provide evidence as to the location and nature of these genes </plain></SENT>
