<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B) is an intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> known to dephosphorylate and inactivate upstream tyrosine phosphoproteins in the insulin signalling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We and others reported increased abundance of catalytically impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B in tissue lysates from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> human subjects with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while genetic knockout of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B improves insulin sensitivity and prevents nutritionally mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present work was to further elucidate the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used adenoviral constructs incorporating cDNAs for either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (W/T) or a catalytically inactive C(215)S (C/S) mutant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B to achieve liver-selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B overexpression in young Sprague-Dawley rats using tail vein injection, based on the high degree of hepatotropism of adenovirus 5 (Ad5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An Ad5-lacZ construct encoding beta-galactosidase was used as a control for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> effects alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp was used to study whole body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Control studies in HIRcB cells confirmed catalytic activity and inactivity of W/T and C/S respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B abundance was 2.24 +/- 0.02- and 2.33 +/- 0.04-fold of saline-treated control in liver lysates of W/T and C/S rats respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liver selective overexpression was confirmed by analysis of tissue lysates from liver, fat and muscle tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ad5 treatment did not result in a statistically or clinically significant liver injury, as determined by serum alanine aminotransferase and histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven days post injection, no significant difference in rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin levels were seen in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, under steady-state <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp conditions, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (R(d)), endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production rate (EGP) and serum insulin levels were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that moderate medium-term overabundance, to a degree resembling that seen in insulin-resistant states, of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B in liver tissue does not alter insulin action on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and that the major site of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B is presumably at insulin-responsive target tissue or tissues other than the liver </plain></SENT>
