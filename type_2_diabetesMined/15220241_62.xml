<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: PROactive is an on-going randomized, double-blind outcome study in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> managed with diet and/or oral blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs (combination of oral agents with insulin is permitted) who have a history of macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients are randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (forced titration from 15 to 30 to 45 mg, depending on tolerability) or placebo in addition to existing therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point is the time from randomization to occurrence of a new macrovascular event or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up is estimated to span 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 5238 patients have been randomized from 19 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At entry into the study, patients enrolled are a mean age of 61.8 years, with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for a mean of 9.5 years; 60.9 and 61.5% are taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, respectively; and 33.6% are using insulin in addition to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients are men (66.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients are required to meet one or more of entry criteria, as follows: &gt;6 months' history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (46.7%); coronary artery revascularization (30.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (18.8%), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome for &gt;3 months (13.7%); other evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (48.1%); or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306889" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral arterial occlusive disease</z:e> (19.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-half (48.5%) of the patients have two or more of these risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three-quarters (75.4%) have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and 58.8% are current or previous smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cohort of patients enrolled in PROactive is a typical type 2 diabetic population at high risk of further macrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of this population are ideal for assessing the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> to reduce the cardiovascular risk of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
