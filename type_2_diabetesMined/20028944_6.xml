<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The impact of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk gene transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) on body weight is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As TCF7L2 is expressed in adipose tissue and involved in Wnt-dependent regulation of adipogenesis, we studied the impact of TCF7L2 variants on body composition and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> during lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 309 German subjects at increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, and rs7895340 in TCF7L2 and performed oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests before and after a 9-month lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fat distribution was quantified using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy in a subgroup of 210 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding variables, we observed a negative impact of the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> allele of SNP rs7903146 on change in BMI (P = 0.0034) and on changes in nonvisceral (P = 0.0032) and visceral fat (P = 0.0165) during lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An association of rs7903146 with lifestyle intervention-induced changes in insulin secretion, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, liver fat, or insulin sensitivity were not detected (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Essentially the same results were obtained with SNP rs1255372 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found no effects of SNPs rs11196205 and rs7895340 on change in BMI (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; or = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated alleles of TCF7L2 are associated with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in response to lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated TCF7L2 gene variation predicts the success of lifestyle intervention in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and determines individual susceptibility toward environmental factors </plain></SENT>
