<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 28 women (mean age 57 +/- 6 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were free from overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were placed into low cardiorespiratory fitness (LCF) or average cardiorespiratory fitness (ACF) groups based on a graded exercise test to exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of eight women without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were also examined and served as healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median VO(2peak) value was used as a cutoff for group determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed both conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors, including blood pressure, BMI, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, as well as novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors, such as left ventricular filling dynamics, arterial stiffness, fasting insulin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VO(2peak) values were 69 +/- 14 and 91 +/- 24% of predicted values for sedentary age-matched healthy individuals in the LCF and ACF groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI was significantly greater in the LCF group (P &lt; 0.05); however, no differences were observed in age, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, or resting hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CRP was 3.3-fold higher in the LCF group (6.3 +/- 41. vs. 1.9 +/- 1.7 mg/l, P &lt; 0.05), whereas other novel markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were not significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant negative relationships were observed between VO(2peak) and both CRP (r = -0.49) and the homeostasis model assessment index (r = -0.48) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The novel finding of this investigation is that low cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with elevated CRP and reduced fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
