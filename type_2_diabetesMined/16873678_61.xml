<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice are a well-characterized mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in which increased hepatic lipogenesis is thought to be responsible for the phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) plays a key role in the control of lipogenesis through the transcriptional regulation of lipogenic genes, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase and fatty acid synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study reveals that ChREBP gene expression and ChREBP nuclear protein content are significantly increased in liver of ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To explore the involvement of ChREBP in the physiopathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we have developed an adenovirus-mediated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference technique in which short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (shRNAs) were used to inhibit ChREBP expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liver-specific inhibition of ChREBP in ob/ob mice markedly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> by specifically decreasing lipogenic rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> also led to decreased levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and nonesterified fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, insulin signaling was improved in liver, skeletal muscles, and white adipose tissue, and overall <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin sensitivity were restored in ob/ob mice after a 7-day treatment with the recombinant adenovirus expressing shRNA against ChREBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results demonstrate that ChREBP is central for the regulation of lipogenesis in vivo and plays a determinant role in the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
