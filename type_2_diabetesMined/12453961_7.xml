<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of the unique HNF-1alpha G319S mutation in a population of aboriginal youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to describe the relationship between clinical and historical characteristics and the presence or absence of the HNF-1alpha G319S mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participating youth were genotyped for the G319S mutation of the HNF-1alpha gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical, laboratory, and historical data were collected via chart review (blinded to genotype results) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison data were derived from another study involving young nondiabetic pregnant aboriginal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 51 youth seen sequentially in a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 21 (41.2%) had at least one copy of the mutant allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency in the study population was 0.29 (95% CI 0.20-0.38), which was significantly different from the allele frequency of 0.13 in the comparison population (chi(2) = 6.78, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the homozygous mutation (S319/S319) was 0.18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean BMI was significantly lower (P = 0.002), mean HbA(1c) was significantly higher (P = 0.02), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> was significantly less frequent (P = 0.004) in those with the mutation compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean insulin levels were lower and insulin sensitivity (assessed by homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]) was greater in the homozygote group compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> group (P = 0.002 and P = 0.0007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent gradient was observed for these characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the association between the HNF-1alpha G319S mutation and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those with the mutation lacked clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>) and had lower insulin levels, suggesting that an insulin-secretory and/or -production defect plays an important role in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the pathophysiology of the S319 homo- and heterozygote is needed because it may impact treatment and/or prevention of this disease </plain></SENT>
