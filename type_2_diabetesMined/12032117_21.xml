<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, other factors implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0003985'>renal fibrosis</z:mp> and increased TGF-beta synthesis include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> and high dietary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the effect of angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB) and dietary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> restriction on the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of TGF-beta in hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and elevated albumin excretion rate (AER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and AER between 10 and 200 microg/min were randomized to receive either 50 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> daily (n = 11) or placebo (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug therapy was given in two 4-week phases, separated by a 4-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the last 2 weeks of each phase, patients were assigned to regular- or low-<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> diets in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parameters measured at week 0 and 4 of each phase included plasma TGF-beta concentration, TGF-beta urinary excretion, AER, clinic mean arterial blood pressure, and urinary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma TGF-beta was unaffected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> treatment or <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> group, urinary TGF-beta excretion decreased by 23.2% (-39.2 and 13.6) [median (interquartile range)] and 38.5% (-46.8 and -6.1) in the regular- and low-<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> phases, respectively (P &lt; 0.05 for drug effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, median changes of 0.0% (-12.1 and 44.4) and 0.0% (-29.2 and 110.7) occurred in the regular- and low-<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> phases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> restriction did not affect urinary TGF-beta excretion in either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>- or placebo-treated patients (P = 0.54 for overall dietary effect), and there was no evidence of interaction between drug and diet (P = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with elevated AER, the ARB <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> restriction, reduced urinary TGF-beta excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the renoprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> may include a reduction in renal TGF-beta production </plain></SENT>
