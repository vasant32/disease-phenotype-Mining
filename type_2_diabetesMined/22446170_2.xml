<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Treatment-naive patients or those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, or thiazolidinedione entered a 10-week <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> dose-optimization period with only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were then randomized, along with patients previously receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> â‰¥30 mg, to 48 weeks of double-blind dapagliflozin 5 (n = 141) or 10 mg (n = 140) or placebo (n = 139) every day plus open-label <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary objective compared HbA(1c) change from baseline with dapagliflozin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> versus placebo plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary analysis was based on ANCOVA model using last observation carried forward; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remaining analyses used repeated-measures analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 24, the mean reduction from baseline in HbA(1c) was -0.42% for placebo versus -0.82 and -0.97% for dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively (P = 0.0007 and P &lt; 0.0001 versus placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> alone had greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (3 kg) than those receiving dapagliflozin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (0.7-1.4 kg) at week 48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Through 48 weeks: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was rare; more events suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infection</z:e> were reported with dapagliflozin (8.6-9.2%) than placebo (2.9%); events suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> showed no clear drug effect (5.0-8.5% for dapagliflozin and 7.9% for placebo); dapagliflozin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> groups had less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (2.1-4.3%) compared with placebo plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (6.5%); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and fractures were rare </plain></SENT>
