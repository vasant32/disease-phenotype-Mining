<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is known to be associated with decrements in memory and executive functions and information-processing speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is less clear, however, at which stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> these cognitive decrements develop and how they progress over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated cognitive functioning of patients with recent screen-detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, thus providing insight into the nature and severity of cognitive decrements in the early stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Possible risk factors were also addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Included in this study were 183 diabetic patients from a previously established study cohort and 69 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A full neuropsychological assessment, addressing six cognitive domains, was made for each participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Raw test scores were standardized into z scores per domain and compared between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible risk factors for cognitive decrements were examined with multivariate linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to scores for the control group, mean z scores were between 0.01 and 0.2 lower in the diabetic group across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains, but after adjustment for differences in IQ between patients and control subjects, only memory performance was significantly reduced (mean difference -0.15 [95% CI -0.28 to -0.03]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A history of macrovascular disease and current smoking were significant determinants of slower information-processing speed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that modest cognitive decrements are already present at the early stage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A history of macrovascular disease and smoking are significant risk factors for some early decrements </plain></SENT>
