<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 20-week, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicentre, treat-to-target study, 244 insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA(1c)&gt;or=7.0 and &lt;or=9.0% on OAD treatment, were randomized (1 : 1) to one of two treatment arms using 3.9-5.0 or 4.4-6.1 mmol/l FPG as titration targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once-daily insulin detemir doses were adjusted using algorithm-guided patient-directed titration to achieve target FPG values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the combined treatment groups achieved a mean HbA(1c) level of 6.9% at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Substantial reductions in HbA(1c) were seen in both treatment groups, with the majority of subjects in both titration groups at the end of the study achieving the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>)-recommended HbA(1c) level of &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 3.9-5.0 mmol/l FPG target treatment group, HbA(1c) values decreased from a baseline mean of 8.0% to 6.8% at 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 4.4-6.1 mmol/l FPG target group, HbA(1c) values decreased from 7.9% at baseline to 7.0% at 20 weeks (Intention to treat - last observation carried forward data set) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These decreases were significantly different between the two treatment groups (Least squares mean difference = -0.271, 95% CI -0.441 to -0.101, p = 0.0019), favouring the FPG target of 3.9-5.0 mmol/l vs. the 4.4-6.1 mmol/l target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study period, 64.3% of subjects in the 3.9-5.0 mmol/l treatment group achieved HbA(1c) levels &lt;7% compared with 54.5% of subjects in the 4.4-6.1 mmol/l group (95% CI 1.03-3.37, odds ratio 1.86, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin detemir dosing patterns were similar between treatment groups, with the 3.9-5.0 mmol/l group using slightly greater doses throughout the study period (0.57 U/kg vs. 0.51 U/kg at the end of the study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> episodes were low and were comparable between treatment groups (7.73 and 5.27 events/subject/year for the 3.9-5.0 and 4.4-6.1 mmol/l groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A single event of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reported in the 3.9-5.0 mmol/l group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean weight changes from baseline to the end of the study were small and did not differ significantly between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 3.9-5.0 mmol/l FPG target showed superior efficacy compared with the 4.4-6.1 mmol/l target, although both FPG titration targets resulted in substantial reductions of HbA(1c) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a patient-directed insulin titration algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A majority of subjects in both titration groups achieved the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>-recommended guideline of &lt;7% HbA(1c) at the end of the study with low rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that lowering the fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> target using a self-directed titration algorithm with once-daily detemir is safe and increases the likelihood of achieving the target level of HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Indeed, using this approach, a majority of patients can achieve an HbA(1c) of &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
