<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cohort study in 197 general practices in the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>General Practice Research Database including 48,579 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> first diagnosed between 1996 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measures included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and prescription of hypoglycemic, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1996 to 2006, incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased and the mean age at diagnosis declined in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prescription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> within 12 months of diagnosis increased (1996, women 4.9%, men 5.1%; 2005, women 63.5%, men 71.0%), as did drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system (1996, women 19.4%, men 21.5%; 2005, women 45.5%, men 54.6%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1996, women 19.1%, men 15.8%; 2005, women 45.5%, men 42.8%), whereas prescription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality in the first 24 months after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis declined in men from 47.9 per 1,000 person-years for subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed in 1996 to 25.2 for subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed in 2006 and in women from 37.4 in 1996 to 27.6 in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multiple regression model adjusting for age and comorbidity, prescription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> before or after diagnosis, renin-angiotensin system drugs before or after diagnosis, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> after diagnosis were associated with lower mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Widespread implementation of more effective prescribing to control <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and blood pressure may have contributed to recent declines in early mortality in men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
