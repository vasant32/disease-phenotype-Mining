<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this population-based study, we investigated whether APOC3 polymorphisms increase type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and need for insulin treatment in lean participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort (n = 7,983), Cox and logistic regression models were used to analyse the associations and interactive effects of APOC3 promoter variants (-482C &gt; T, -455T &gt; C) and BMI on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were followed by replication in an independent case-control sample (1,817 cases, 2,292 controls) and meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In lean participants, the -482T allele was associated with increased risk of prevalent and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: OR -482CT 1.47 (95% CI 1.13-1.92), -482TT 1.40 (95% CI 0.83-2.35), p = 0.009 for trend; HR -482CT 1.35 (95% CI 0.96-1.89), -482TT 1.68 (95% CI 0.91-3.1), p = 0.03 for trend, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis was highly significant (-482T meta-analysis p = 1.1 Ã— 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A borderline significant interaction was observed for insulin use among participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (-482CT*BMI p = 0.06, -455TC*BMI p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: At a population-based level, the influence of APOC3 promoter variants on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk varies with the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lean carriers of the -482T allele had increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, while such an effect was not observed in overweight participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in overweight participants the -455C allele seemed protective against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The interaction of the variants with need for insulin treatment may indicate beta cell involvement in lean participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest overlap in the genetic backgrounds of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in lean patients </plain></SENT>
