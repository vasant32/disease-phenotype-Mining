<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the accuracy of Neuropad for the diagnosis and staging of distal symmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (DPN) across different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, using multiple-level likelihood ratios (LRs) to interpret the time necessary to complete the color change of the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, cohort-type diagnostic accuracy study in 251 consecutive adult type 2 diabetic patients with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> or other potential causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, who were recruited between January 2005 and December 2008 from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outpatient clinics in Alexandroupolis Hospital, Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were tested for DPN by means of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> disability score (NDS) and Neuropad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple-level LRs for time to complete color change were calculated across different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The areas under the curve for the diagnosis of any (NDS of ≥3), at least moderate (NDS of ≥6), or severe (NDS of ≥9) DPN were 0.91, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calculation of multiple-level LRs showed that time to complete color change &lt;360 s suggested the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Values between 360 and 1,000 s were indicative of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, values between 1,000 and 1,200 or &gt;1,200 s were strongly suggestive of moderate or severe DPN, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuropad could be used as a triage test for the diagnosis and staging of DPN in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, prompting referral to specialized care setting </plain></SENT>
