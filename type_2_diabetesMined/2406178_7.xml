<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its public health impact appears to be increasing and the greatest genetic predisposition to the disease is encountered in developing communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reduction or elimination of disease in whole populations is a fundamental goal in public health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whilst several factors are associated with the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, it is not clear how they cause the disease, if indeed they do, nor whether they act in the same way in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors may be true determinants of a disease but alternatively they may be associated with its occurrence only by virtue of an innocent relationship with the true causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, known risk factors usually explain only a small proportion of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of risk factors in disease causation is therefore of fundamental importance in considering disease prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two alternative strategies for prevention of disease in populations have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The population strategy seeks to remove the causes of disease in communities as a whole, whilst the high-risk strategy aims to identify subjects at increased risk, and to intervene selectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The population approach should be tried and carefully evaluated in selected communities at above-average risk of several noncommunicable diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, certain epidemiological features of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including the distributional characteristics of glycaemia and the complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, the clustering of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in the diabetic subpopulation, as well as uncertainties over the causal nature of known risk factors, suggest that a high-risk approach to prevention is also appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
