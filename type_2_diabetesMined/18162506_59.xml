<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Insulin gene (INS) mutations have recently been described as a cause of permanent neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the prevalence, genetics, and clinical phenotype of INS mutations in large cohorts of patients with neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and permanent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The INS gene was sequenced in 285 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed before 2 years of age, 296 probands with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY), and 463 patients with young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (nonobese, diagnosed &lt;45 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None had a molecular genetic diagnosis of monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified heterozygous INS mutations in 33 of 141 probands diagnosed at &lt;6 months, 2 of 86 between 6 and 12 months, and none of 58 between 12 and 24 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three known mutations (A24D, F48C, and R89C) account for 46% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were six novel mutations: H29D, L35P, G84R, C96S, S101C, and Y103C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INS mutation carriers were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulin treated from diagnosis and were diagnosed later than ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel mutation carriers (11 vs. 8 weeks, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 279 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e>, the frequency of KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS gene mutations was 31, 10, and 12%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous R6C mutation cosegregated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a MODY family and is probably pathogenic, but the L68M substitution identified in a patient with young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be a rare nonfunctional variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that INS mutations are the second most common cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e> and a rare cause of MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin gene mutation screening is recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients diagnosed before 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
