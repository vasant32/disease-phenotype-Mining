<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the effects of 3 and 28 days of overfeeding by 5,200 kJ/day in 41 sedentary individuals with and without a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FH+ and FH- respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measures included body weight, fat distribution (computed tomography) and insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Body weight was increased compared with baseline at 3 and 28 days in both groups (p &lt; 0.001), FH+ individuals having gained significantly more weight than FH- individuals at 28 days (3.4 +/- 1.6 vs 2.2 +/- 1.4 kg, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were increased at 3 and 28 days compared with baseline in both groups, with greater increases in FH+ than in FH- for insulin at +3 and +28 days (p &lt; 0.01) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at +28 days (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> also increased at both time points, but without a significant group effect (p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral insulin sensitivity decreased in the whole cohort at +28 days (54.8 +/- 17.7 to 50.3 +/- 15.6 micromol min(-1) [kg fat-free mass](-1), p = 0.03), and insulin sensitivity by HOMA-IR decreased at both time points (p &lt; 0.001) and to a greater extent in FH+ than in FH- (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liver fat, subcutaneous and visceral fat increased similarly in the two groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overfeeding induced weight and fat gain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and hepatic fat deposition in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, individuals with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> gained more weight and greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that healthy individuals with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are predisposed to adverse effects of overfeeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00562393 FUNDING: The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australia (no. #427639) </plain></SENT>
