<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of Leu on cell differentiation during embryonic development is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that Leu supplementation during pregnancy significantly increased fetal body weight, caused fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002727'>hypoinsulinemia</z:mp>, and decreased the relative islet area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also used rat embryonic pancreatic explant culture for elucidating the mechanism of Leu action on β-cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that in the presence of Leu, differentiation of pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1-positive progenitor cells into neurogenin3-positive <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> progenitor cells was inefficient and resulted in decreased β-cell formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, Leu increases the intracellular levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1-α, a repressor of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> fate in the pancreas, by activating the mTOR complex 1 signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our findings indicate that Leu supplementation during pregnancy could potentially increase the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> by inhibiting the differentiation of pancreatic <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> progenitor cells during a susceptible period of fetal life </plain></SENT>
