<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in both hepatocytes and pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has implicated <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the modulation of both insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells and the control of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent gene expression in both hepatocytes and beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the question could be raised as to whether AMPK plays a role in these processes by modulating HNF-4alpha function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that activation of AMPK by 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR) in hepatocytes greatly diminished HNF-4alpha protein levels and consequently downregulates the expression of HNF-4alpha target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative evaluation of HNF-4alpha target gene expression revealed diminished <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for HNF-1alpha, GLUT2, L-type <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase, aldolase B, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)-B, and apoCIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data clearly demonstrate that the MODY1/HNF-4alpha transcription factor is a novel target of AMPK in hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, it can be suggested that in pancreatic beta-cells, AMPK also acts by decreasing HNF-4alpha protein level, and therefore insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, the possible role of AMPK in the physiopathology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be considered </plain></SENT>
