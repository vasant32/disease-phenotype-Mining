<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key negative regulator of signalling by both of these hormones, so that inhibitors of this enzyme may provide promise for correcting <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> abnormalities in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As with other tyrosine phosphatases, identification of viable drug candidates targeting PTP1B has been elusive because of the nature of its active site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning with novel phosphotyrosine mimetics, we have designed some of the most potent PTP1B inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, their highly acidic structures limit intrinsic permeability and pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">Ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrugs</z:chebi> of these inhibitors improve their drug-like properties with the goal of delivering these nanomolar inhibitors to the cytoplasm of cells within target tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to identifying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrugs</z:chebi> that is able to deliver active drugs into cells to inhibit PTP1B and increase insulin signalling, these compounds were further modified to gain a variety of cleavage properties for targeting activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One such <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> candidate improved insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice, with lowered fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels seen in the context of lowered fasting insulin levels following 4 days of intraperitoneal dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this study highlight the potential for design of orally active drug candidates targeting PTP1B, while also delineating the considerable challenges remaining </plain></SENT>
