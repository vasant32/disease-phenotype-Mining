<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To optimize identification of future diabetic patients, the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) introduced criteria for impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) in 1997 (IFG 6.1 mmol/l [IFG6.1]) and lowered the threshold from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l (IFG5.6) in 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the consequences of lowering the IFG cutoff on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) mortality and to evaluate whether this risk is explained by a conversion to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within 6.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a population-based cohort, the Hoorn Study, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was determined in 1989 and 1996 (n = 1,428) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified in 1989 according to 1997 and 2003 ADA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with IFG in 1989 were further classified according to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status in 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality (n = 81) in the period 1996-2005 were adjusted for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with IFG6.1, but not IFG5.6, had a significantly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality risk than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (NFG) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects who converted from IFG to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (IFG6.1: 42%; IFG5.6: 21%) had a more than twofold risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality (IFG6.1: 2.47 [1.17-5.19]; IFG5.6: 2.14 [1.12-4.10]) than subjects with NFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFG subjects who did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not have significantly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality risks (IFG6.1: 1.50 [0.72-3.15]; IFG5.6: 1.15 [0.69-1.93]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The lower cutoff for IFG (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> 2003 criteria) results in a category of IFG that no longer represents a high-risk state of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, only subjects who convert from IFG to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
