<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A placebo-controlled prospective safety study of quick-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has shown a 40% reduction in cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations for this decrease are that through re-establishing diurnal variation a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and its associated risk factors occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a decrease in the activity of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> and renin-angiotensin systems and re-establishment of diurnal variations in the pituitary-adrenal axis may play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the most probable explanation is that because of the lowering of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> there are decreases in hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and an increased uptake of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> leading to decreased levels of postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, free fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, which cause decreases in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and accumulation of atheroma </plain></SENT>
