<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Omentin is a protein expressed and secreted from visceral but not subcutaneous adipose tissue that increases insulin sensitivity in human adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> on the regulation of two omentin isoforms, gene expression and plasma levels were measured in lean, overweight, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Omentin 1 was shown to be the major circulating isoform in human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lean subjects had significantly higher plasma omentin 1 levels than <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and overweight subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, higher plasma omentin 1 levels were detected in women compared with men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma omentin 1 levels were inversely correlated with BMI, waist circumference, leptin levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as measured by homeostasis model assessment and positively correlated with adiponectin and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both omentin 1 and omentin 2 gene expression were decreased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and were highly correlated with each other in visceral adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, decreased omentin levels are associated with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, omentin levels may be predictive of the metabolic consequences or co-morbidities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
