<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the reliability and validity of a brief <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge test has two components: a 14-item general test and a 9-item insulin-use subscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two populations completed the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one population, patients received <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in their community from a variety of providers, while the other population received care from local health departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cronbach's coefficient alpha was used to calculate scale reliability for each sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine validity, patient group differences were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that test scores would be higher for patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, for patients with more education, and for patients who had received <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The coefficient alpha s for the general test and the insulin-use subscale indicate that both are reliable, alpha &gt; or = 0.70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the community sample, patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> scored higher than patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the general test and the insulin-use subscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the health department sample, patients with type 1 scored higher than patients with type 2 on the insulin-use subscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For both samples, scores increased as the years of formal education completed increased, and patients who received <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education scored higher than patients who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the samples differed demographically, the reliability and validity of the test were supported in both the community and the health department samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the test is appropriate for a variety of settings and patient populations </plain></SENT>
