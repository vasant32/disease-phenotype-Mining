<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum Lp(a) was measured in 26 type 1 and 107 type 2 diabetic patients and 126 non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c), fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and urinary albumin were also assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lp(a) concentrations were higher in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients compared with controls (P&lt;0.0001 and P&lt;0.0001, respectively), and were higher in type 1 than type 2 diabetic patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Waist-hip ratio (WHR) was an independent determinant of Lp(a) concentrations in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
