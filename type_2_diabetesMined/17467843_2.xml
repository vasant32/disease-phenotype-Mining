<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) is characterized by increased proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (P/I ratio), increased glycation and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports implicated that increased P/I ratio, glycation and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> constitute markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its clinical relevance remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study we investigated the relationship between the P/I ratio, glycation and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers in patients with T2DM, using newly developed intact chemiluminescent immunoassay for proinsulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting intact proinsulin, insulin, advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), pentosidine, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> and urine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> as well as other metabolic parameters were measured in 64 T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using univariate analysis, P/I ratio showed significant positive correlations with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r=0.465), HbA1c (r=0.434) and AGEs (r=0.282), and significant negative correlations with insulin (r=-0.330) and HOMA-beta (r=-0.520) even after adjustment for age, sex, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, smoking and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that HOMA-beta, HbA1c and AGEs were independently and significantly correlated with P/I ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that not only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> per se but also glycation is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
