<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prospective association between endogenous sex hormones and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in older men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A standardized medical history was obtained, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed, and plasma samples for sex hormones and covariates were collected from ambulatory, community-dwelling men and women at baseline from 1984 to 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 8 years later (1992-1996), another medical history was obtained, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed, fasting and 2-h insulin levels were measured, and the homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report is based on the 294 men and 233 women, aged 55-89 years, who completed both visits and who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as determined by history or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test at baseline, as well as women who were postmenopausal and not taking replacement <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In age-adjusted correlation analyses, total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was inversely and significantly related to subsequent levels of fasting and postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin in men, whereas bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and bioavailable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> were positively and significantly related to fasting and postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin in women (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was similar significant association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) in unadjusted and multiply adjusted analyses (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 26 men and 17 women with new (incident) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds for new <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 2.7 (95% CI 1.1-6.6) for men in the lowest quartile of total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and 2.9 (1.1-8.4) for women in the highest quartile of bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels in men and high <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels in women predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in older adults </plain></SENT>
