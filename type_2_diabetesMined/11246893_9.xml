<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In humans, the Met326Ile missense variant of the p85alpha regulatory subunit of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) has been associated with either significant reductions in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in Caucasians or a significantly higher insulin secretory response in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we genotyped 1,190 Caucasian males to evaluate the impact in vivo of the Met326Ile variant of the p85alpha subunit of PI3K on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response, intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, and the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after 20 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also expressed the variant in vitro to evaluate the impact on insulin-stimulated activation of protein kinase B (PKB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Met326Ile variant of p85alpha was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or with alterations in insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, or intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expressed in vitro, the Ile326 and the Met326 variant acted equally as a dominant-negative and prevented (60-70% inhibition) insulin-mediated activation of PKB by inhibiting the phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the Met326Ile variant of the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K is likely to be as functionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in vivo as in vitro </plain></SENT>
