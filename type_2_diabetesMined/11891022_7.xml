<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship of the A/G variant of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene promoter at position -308 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and abdominal fat distribution in type 2 diabetic patients in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha polymorphism was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 142 healthy volunteers and 132 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index in healthy subjects and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abdominal fat distribution was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) scanning in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha polymorphism was detected in three healthy volunteers and three type 2 diabetic patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them being heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in allele frequencies of the -308 polymorphism between healthy subjects (0.0106) and type 2 diabetic patients (0.0114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HOMA index was no significant difference between healthy subjects with and without polymorphism (1.09 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.02 +/- 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR), an index of insulin sensitivity, was not significantly different between diabetic patients with and without TNF-alpha polymorphism (40.4 +/- 4.1 vs. 45.0 +/- 1.8 micromol/kg per min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no remarkable effect of TNF-alpha polymorphism on abdominal fat distribution was observed in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that A/G heterozygotes of the TNF-alpha gene promoter at position -308 play no major role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or abdominal fat distribution in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
