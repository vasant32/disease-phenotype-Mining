<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice that express a dominant-negative IGF-1 receptor, specifically in skeletal muscle (MKR mice), exhibit severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and hyper-glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the worsening of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> state in these animals, MKR mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">phloridzin</z:chebi> (PHZ), which inhibits intestinal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reabsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were decreased and urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were increased in response to PHZ treatment in MKR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PHZ treatment also increased food intake in MKR mice; however, the fat mass was decreased and lean body mass did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin, fatty acid, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were not affected by PHZ treatment in MKR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in white adipose tissue was significantly increased in response to PHZ treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the reduction in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> following PHZ treatment, there was no improvement in insulin-stimulated whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in MKR mice and neither was there suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that glucotoxicity plays little or no role in the worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> that occurs in the MKR mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
