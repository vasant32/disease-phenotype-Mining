<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translation of this reality into therapeutic guidelines always requires interventional evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence for combined approaches in controlling for BP and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was provided by Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular disease</z:e>: PreterAx and DiamicroN-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), conducted in over 11 000 subjects from 20 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction in systolic BP by 7.1 mm Hg, in diastolic BP by 2.9 mm Hg and in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c by 0.61% points in the combined routine BP lowering and intensive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-control group after an average 4.3 years of follow-up resulted in a relative risk reduction of 28% in renal events, 24% in cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 18% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While other major intervention trials performed in similar populations with analogous goals did not achieve the same level of positive therapeutic evidence and even pointed to some risk of intensified treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three major studies [Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD), Veterans Affairs <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Trial (VADT) and ADVANCE] showed significant reduction in renal events, the major risk in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The divergence for other outcomes underlines the importance of considering specific therapeutic approaches for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and prudent targets for BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current target values for glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> of 6.5-7% and for BP of 130/80 mmHg appear safe and beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The potential long-term benefit, particularly that of initial tight blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, suggested by recent post-trial evidence is currently being evaluated in the ADVANCE-ON study </plain></SENT>
