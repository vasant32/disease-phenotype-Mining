<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Functional studies suggest that the nonsynonymous K121Q polymorphism in the ectoenzyme nucleotide <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) may confer susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>; genetic evidence on its effect on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, however, has been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a new meta-analysis that includes novel unpublished data from the ENPP1 Consortium and recent negative findings from large association studies to address the contribution of K121Q to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After a systematic review of the literature, we evaluated the effect of ENPP1 K121Q on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk under three genetic models using a random-effects approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our primary analysis consisted of 30 studies comprising 15,801 case and 26,241 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and large differences in allele frequencies across populations, we limited our meta-analysis to those of self-reported European descent and, when available, included BMI as a covariate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a modest increase in risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for QQ homozygotes in white populations (combined odds ratio [OR] 1.38 [95% CI 1.10-1.74], P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of publication bias, but we noted significant residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among studies (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On meta-regression, 16% of the effect was accounted for by the mean BMI of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was stronger in studies in which control subjects were leaner but disappeared after adjustment for mean control BMI (combined OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.75-1.15], P = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ENPP1 Q121 variant increases risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under a recessive model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> in whites, an effect that appears to be modulated by BMI </plain></SENT>
