<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible association of the variants in the nucleotide binding fold regions of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> receptor 1 (SUR1) gene with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and altered insulin secretion in Finnish subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The nucleotide binding fold regions of the SUR1 gene were amplified with polymerase chain reaction and screened by the single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis in 42 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and 40 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detected variants were further investigated in 377 normoglycemic subjects by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of the variants of the SUR1 gene on first-phase insulin secretion was studied in 295 normoglycemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, one amino acid change (S1369A), four silent substitutions (R1273R, L829L, T759T, and K649K), and three intron variants were identified in the nucleotide binding fold regions of the SUR1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tagGCC allele of exon 16 splice acceptor site was more frequent in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (0.55 allele frequency, n = 42) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.60, n = 40) than in normoglycemic subjects (0.43, n = 377) (P1 = 0.024 and P2 = 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, an AGG allele of the R1273R polymorphism was more common in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (0.87) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.87) than in normoglycemic subjects (0.74) (P1 = 0.009 and P2 = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the S1369A, R1273R, and cagGCC--&gt;tagGCC variants of the SUR1 gene were not associated with altered first-phase insulin secretion in 295 normoglycemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a functional variant that contributes to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may locate close to the SUR1 gene </plain></SENT>
