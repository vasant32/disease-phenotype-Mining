<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive study of 2352 type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients who were treated at specialist clinics for at least 12 months prior to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 53.0±16.0 years and had 8.0±6.0 years known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>47% had their HbA1c assessed in the past year (mean 8.2±2.4%) with 29% achieving a level &lt;6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>21% had BP within 130/80 mmHg and 65% were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were assessed in 45% of the patients with mean cholesterol level of 4.9±1.2 mmol/L, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> of 1.3±0.7 mmol/L and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> of 1.2±0.7 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>13% of the patients were treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, mostly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Background <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (18%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> (14%) were the most common eye complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Macrovascular disease was rare, and 48% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Half of the patients benefitted from standard care, and a third had appropriate glycaemic control - attributed to access to, rather than quality of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study provided evidence to support appropriate interventions to diabetic populations of sub-Saharan origin </plain></SENT>
