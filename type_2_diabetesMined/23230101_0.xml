<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 1,123 T2DM participants, ages 34-86 years, in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Heart Study followed up for an average of 7.4 years were separated using baseline computed tomography scans of CAC (0-9, 10-99, 100-299, 300-999, and ≥1,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was performed to examine the association between CAC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality adjusting for FRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas under the curve (AUC) with and without CAC were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Net reclassification improvement (NRI) compared FRS (model 1) versus FRS+CAC (model 2) using 7.4-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality risk categories 0% to &lt;7%, 7% to &lt;20%, and ≥20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Overall, 8% of participants died of cardiovascular causes during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the odds ratios (95% CI) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality using CAC 0-9 as the reference group were, CAC 10-99: 2.93 (0.74-19.55); CAC 100-299: 3.17 (0.70-22.22); CAC 300-999: 4.41(1.15-29.00); and CAC ≥1,000: 11.23 (3.24-71.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AUC (95% CI) without CAC was 0.70 (0.67-0.73), AUC with CAC was 0.75 (0.72-0.78), and NRI was 0.13 (0.07-0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS In T2DM, CAC predicts <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality and meaningfully reclassifies participants, suggesting clinical utility as a risk stratification tool in a population already at increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
