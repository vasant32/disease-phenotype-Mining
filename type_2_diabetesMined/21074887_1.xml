<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether glycemic control is improved when motivational interviewing (MI), a patient-centered behavior change strategy, is used with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self management education (DSME) as compared to DSME alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) patients (n=234) were randomized into 4 groups: MI+DSME or DSME alone, with or without use of a computerized summary of patient self management barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared HbA1c changes between groups at 6 months and investigated mediators of HbA1c change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: study patients attended the majority of the four intervention visits (mean 3.4), but drop-out rate was high at follow-up research visits (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression showed that groups receiving MI had a mean change in HbA1c that was significantly lower (less improved) than those not receiving MI (t=2.10; p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mediators of HbA1c change for the total group were <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> distress; no between-group differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DSME improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, underlining its benefit for T2DM management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, MI+DSME was less effective than DSME alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, weak support was found for the clinical utility of MI in the management of T2DM delivered by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> educators </plain></SENT>
