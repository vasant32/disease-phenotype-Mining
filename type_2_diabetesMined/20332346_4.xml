<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this association is sex specific and independent of susceptibility for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three separate groups of 114, 90, and 66 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were included in this study and compared with 93 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for &gt;15 years without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and 472 population control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control group was used to determine an association in the three patient groups separately, and the population control group was used to estimate the genotype risk [odds ratio (CI)] for the population in a pooled analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The population control subjects were also compared with 562 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> to determine whether the association was independent of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CNDP1 genotype was determined by fragment analysis after PCR amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the 5-5 homozygous genotype was 28, 36, and 41% in the three diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> patient groups and 43 and 42% in the diabetic and population control subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-5 homozygous genotype occurred significantly less frequently in women in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patient groups compared with diabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genotype risk for the population was estimated to be 0.5 (0.30-0.68) in women and 1.2 (0.77-1.69) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 562 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> did not differ from the general population (P = 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the association between the CNDP1 gene and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> is sex specific and independent of susceptibility for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
