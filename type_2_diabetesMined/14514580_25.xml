<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 22778 twins of the Finnish Twin Cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cohort was compiled in 1975 and includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> same-sexed twins born in Finland before 1958 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on alcohol, smoking, diet, physical activity, medical, and social conditions was obtained by questionnaires administered in 1975, 1981, and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By record linkage to national registers of hospital discharge and prescribed medication, 580 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified during 20 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate alcohol consumption (5-29.9 g/day in men and 5-19.9 g/day in women) tended to be associated with a reduced incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with low consumption (&lt;5 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimates were lower in overweight (BMI &gt;or=25.0 kg/m(2)) subjects (relative risk 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0 [men]; 0.6, 0.3-1.1 [women]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High alcohol consumption (&gt;or=20 g/day) was associated with an increased incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in lean women (2.9, 1.1-7.5) but not in overweight women or in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, binge drinking was associated with an increased incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (2.1, 1.0-4.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analyses of alcohol-discordant twin pairs supported a reduced risk in moderate consuming twins compared with their low-consuming cotwins (odds ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, binge drinking and high alcohol consumption may increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women </plain></SENT>
