<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to describe the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on mortality among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a population-based national electronic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> database for 35- to 84-year-olds in Scotland for 2001-2007 linked to mortality records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SES was derived from an area-based measure with Q5 and Q1 representing the most deprived and affluent quintiles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) for mortality among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the population without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> stratified by age (35-64 and 65-84 years), sex, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&lt; 2 and ≥ 2 years), and SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete data were available for 210,994 eligible individuals (99.4%), and there were 33,842 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absolute mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased with increasing age and socioeconomic deprivation and was higher for men than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RR for mortality associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was highest for women aged 35-64 years in Q1 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration &lt; 2 years at 4.83 (95% CI 3.15-7.40) and lowest for men aged 65-84 years in Q5 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration ≥ 2 years at 1.13 (1.03-1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SES modifies the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mortality so that RR for mortality is lower among more deprived populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also interact with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to influence RR of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in prevalence of comorbidities may explain these findings </plain></SENT>
