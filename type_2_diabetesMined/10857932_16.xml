<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Charts were reviewed for a group of patients who were examined in 1998, followed for &gt; or = 1 year, and had two or more visits during that year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Process measures and metabolic outcomes were studied for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and glycemic control was assessed for patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 121 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a mean age of 63 years, a mean BMI of 31 kg/m2, and a mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many had comorbidities or complications: 80% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 64% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, 78% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, 22% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and 21% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Management of type 2 diabetic patients was complex: 38% used oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> alone (54% of these were using two or more agents), 31% used oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> and insulin, and 26% used insulin alone; 42% of patients taking insulin therapy injected insulin three or more times per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 12 months, 74% of patients had dilated eye examinations, 70% had <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, and 55% had urine albumin screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 87% had a foot examination at their last visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure levels averaged 133/72 mmHg, cholesterol levels averaged 4.63 mmol/l, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels averaged 1.99 mmol/l, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels averaged 1.24 mmol/l, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels averaged 2.61 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Random blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels averaged 8.0 mmol/l, and HbAlc levels averaged 6.9 +/- 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 87% of patients had HbAlc levels &lt; or = 8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had mean age of 44 years, a mean BMI of 26 kg/m2, and a mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> type 1 diabetic patients used insulin and averaged 3.4 injections a day; their average HbAlc level was 7.1 +/- 0.2%, and 80% had HbAlc levels &lt; or = 8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although endocrinologists must manage patients with multifaceted problems, complex treatment regimens yield glycemic control levels comparable with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Complications Trial and allow <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> guidelines to be met in a routine practice setting </plain></SENT>
