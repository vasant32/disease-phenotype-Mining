<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the significance of a longevity-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genotype (Mt5178A) derived from a C --&gt; A transversion at nucleotide position 5178 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA, which causes a Leu-to-Met substitution within the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene, in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Mt5178 typing was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism with the restriction enzyme AluI in 1,148 type 2 diabetic Japanese subjects, and the results were compared with the clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, the association of Mt5178 type with early atherosclerotic changes of the bilateral carotid arteries on ultrasonography was assessed in 412 diabetic subjects randomly selected from the original 1,148 type 2 diabetic subjects, while maintaining the same frequency of Mt5178A and Mt5178C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of Mt5178A in the type 2 diabetic subjects (454 of 1,148; 40%) was not different from that previously found in healthy blood donors (114 of 252; 45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were not significantly different between the Mt5178A group (n = 454) and the Mt5178C group (n = 694) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the mean intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) at six sites in the bilateral carotid arteries was significantly smaller in the Mrt5178A group than in the Mt5178C group (0.906 +/- 0.018 vs. 0.995 +/- 0.021 mm, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, P = 0.022), and the Mt5178 type was significantly correlated with both the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and the presence of plaque on multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Mt5178A genotype may be unrelated to the etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, Mt5178A seems to have an antiatherogenic effect, at least in type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
