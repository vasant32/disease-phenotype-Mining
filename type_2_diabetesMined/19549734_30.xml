<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the changes in body composition, with particular interest in the skeletal muscle mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined total body composition with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry annually for 6 years in 2,675 older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also measured mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) with computed tomography in year 1 and year 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 402, 15.0%) was identified by self-report or use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 226, 8.4%) was defined by fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (&gt;or=7 mmol/l) or 2-h postchallenge plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (&gt;or=11.1 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal regression models were fit to examine the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the changes in body composition variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Older adults with either diagnosed or undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed excessive loss of appendicular lean mass and trunk fat mass compared with nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thigh muscle CSA declined two times faster in older women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than their nondiabetic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, race, clinic site, baseline BMI, weight change intention, and actual weight changes over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with excessive loss of skeletal muscle and trunk fat mass in community-dwelling older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Older women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at especially high risk for loss of skeletal muscle mass </plain></SENT>
