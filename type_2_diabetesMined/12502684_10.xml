<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two epidemiological studies found their use associated with increased incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In reviewing publications relating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> injections and implants to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, 25 studies of various study designs and laboratory methods were identified that reported at least one insulin value in nondiabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Research subjects were usually nonobese and often from developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of eight studies that performed sequential oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) after at least 6 months of Depo-Provera or Norplant use, seven found significant elevations (approximate doubling) of insulin at 2 or 3 h after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge; the effects on fasting, half-hour, or 1-h postchallenge insulin values were less consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three studies that performed sequential intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IVGTTs) on injection users <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found an increased early-phase insulin response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One study used sequential hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps to demonstrate reduced total-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake per unit of insulin after 8 weeks of Norplant use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The metabolic studies generally did not show a reduction in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance of their nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, compared with the lean and low-risk women who were usually selected for metabolic research, many U.S. women receiving these injections or implants may start out with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> due to greater weight, sedentary lifestyle, and family or childbearing histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional research could help clarify whether exposure to injectable or implantable contraceptives leads to increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> in women with predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
