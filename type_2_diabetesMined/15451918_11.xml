<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although individuals with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) concentrations &gt; 5.4 mmol/l but &lt; 6.1 mmol/l have been shown to have an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 5 years, little is known about <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>metabolism abnormalities</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity using several indexes derived from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) in 668 subjects from the Quebec Family Study who had varying degrees of FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a progressive decline in indexes of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity when moving from NFG to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with subjects with low NFG (FPG &lt; 4.9 mmol/l), subjects with high NFG (FPG 5.3-6.1 mmol/l) were more insulin resistant (P &lt; 0.01), had higher insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses during an OGTT (P &lt; 0.05), and had <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> (corrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with high NFG were also characterized by higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and reduced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations and by a smaller <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these differences remained significant, even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, subjects with mid NFG (FPG 4.9-5.3 mmol/l) were characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e>, decreased insulin sensitivity, higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations, and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations compared with subjects with low NFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Independent of age, sex, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, there are differences in indexes of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/insulin homeostasis and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> among subjects with low, mid, and high NFG, suggesting the presence, in the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> range, of abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, which may predispose to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
