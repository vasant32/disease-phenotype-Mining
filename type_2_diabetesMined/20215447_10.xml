<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and the risk of overall mortality in a large cohort of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an academic health center enterprise-wide electronic health record (EHR) system to identify 11,141 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4,279 initiators of monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, 4,325 initiators of monotherapy with glipizide, and 2,537 initiators of monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>), &gt;or=18 years of age with and without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and not on insulin or a noninsulin injectable at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for mortality by documentation in the EHR and Social Security <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox models were used to compare cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in the risk of overall mortality was observed among these agents in the entire cohort, but we did find evidence of a trend toward an increased overall mortality risk with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (hazard ratio 1.36 [95% CI 0.96-1.91]) and glipizide versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (1.39 [0.99-1.96]) in those with documented CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not identify an increased mortality risk among the individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> but did suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> may be the preferred <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> in those with underlying CAD </plain></SENT>
