<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, insulin secretion, and beta-cell function in Pima Indians, South Asians, and whites, populations at varying risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 136 Pima Indian, 98 Asian, and 80 white nondiabetic and 172 Pima Indian, 40 Asian, and 49 white diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Highly specific assays for insulin, intact proinsulin, and des 31,32 proinsulin were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was assessed using ratio of increment (0 to 30 min) in insulin to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nondiabetic Pima Indians were significantly more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> than Asians and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pima Indian subjects had significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) fasting insulin concentrations (median 109 pmol/l, range 40-250) than Asian (37 pmol/l, range 17-91) and white (30 pmol/l, range 10-82) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences remained significant when controlled for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nondiabetic Pima Indians also had higher fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations and higher early insulin secretion during an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting concentrations of intact proinsulin and des 31,32 proinsulin were also significantly higher in Pima Indians (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of proinsulin-like molecules was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01) in Pima Indians (median 7.9% vs. 12.7% for South Asians and 12.2% for whites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the three ethnic groups showed significantly higher fasting insulin concentrations but lower 30-min insulin and lower ratios of increment (0-30 min) in insulin to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations than did nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proportion of proinsulin-like molecules was not significantly different in diabetic subjects from the three ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These specific assays for insulin indicate that after adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> nondiabetic Pima Indians are truly hyperinsulinemic, which is consistent with their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as measured by other methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>Hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in this population with a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is likely to be due to enhanced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in Pima Indians, the predominant beta-cell secretory product is insulin and not its precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the differences in the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among these three groups are not due to differences in insulin secretion or insulin processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have defective early insulin secretion during OGTTs but show <z:hpo ids='HP_0008283'>fasting hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> even when specific assays for insulin are used </plain></SENT>
