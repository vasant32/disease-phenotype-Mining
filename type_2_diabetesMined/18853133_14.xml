<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that common gene variants known to alter circulating levels of inflammatory proteins, or known to alter autoimmune-related disease risk, influence type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected 46 variants: (1) eight variants known to alter circulating levels of inflammatory proteins, including those in the IL18, IL1RN, IL6R, MIF, PAI1 (also known as SERPINE1) and CRP genes; and (2) 38 variants known to predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, including type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the associations of these variants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a meta-analysis of 4,107 cases and 5,187 controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Genetics Initiative, and the Finland-United States Investigation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We followed up associated variants (p &lt; 0.01) in a further set of 3,125 cases and 3,596 controls from the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no evidence that inflammatory or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> variants are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (at p &lt;or= 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OR observed between the variant altering IL-18 levels, rs2250417, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.00 [95% CI 0.99-1.03]), is much lower than that expected given (1) the effect of the variant on IL-18 levels (0.28 SDs per allele); and (2) estimates, based on other studies, of the correlation between IL-18 levels and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (approximate OR 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.21] per 0.28 SD increase in IL-18 levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study provided no evidence that variants known to alter measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, autoimmune or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> risk, including type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, alter type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
