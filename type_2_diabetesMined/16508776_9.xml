<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined whether minimising the postprandial increase in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> through the ingestion of low- rather than high-glycaemic-index (GI) carbohydrate meals differentially affected cognitive performance in the postprandial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using a within-individual design, 21 free-living subjects (65+/-7.29 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consumed 50 g carbohydrate as a meal with either a low GI (pasta) or a high GI (white bread), or water on three separate mornings following an overnight fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests were administered and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC (gAUC) was associated with poorer verbal memory (paragraph recall, p=0.01; word list recall, p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the GI of the carbohydrate meal and individual differences in response to meal ingestion contributed to the variation in gAUC and consequent memory recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bread consumption, relative to pasta, resulted in both a higher gAUC (p&lt;0.05) and worse delayed verbal memory performance (paragraph recall, p=0.042; wordlist recall, p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, performance following bread consumption was poorer than that following pasta on measures of working memory, executive function and auditory selective attention, while sustained attention showed no sensitivity to type of carbohydrate food consumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Consuming 50 g of a low-GI carbohydrate meal, relative to a high-GI carbohydrate meal, generally results in better cognitive performance in the postprandial period in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in those individuals who experience the greatest food-induced elevations in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
