<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluate the effect of lead variants of these loci on estimates of insulin release and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> derived from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 12 lead variants in or near HMGA2, CENTD2 (also known as ARAP1), KLF14, PRC1, TP53INP1, ZBED3, ZFAND6, CHCHD9, DUSP9, KCNQ1, BCL11A and HNF1A in 5,722 middle-aged people from the population-based Inter99 sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carriers of the major diabetogenic allele of rs1552224 in CENTD2 had increased 30-min plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values (2.0%, p = 2 × 10(-5)) as well as 4.2% reduced insulin release 30 min after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk allele carriers also had decreased BIGTT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin release (AIR), which is a surrogate measure of insulin release where sex, BMI, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin are integrated (5.3%, p = 8 × 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a decreased corrected insulin response (CIR; 9.9%, p = 3 × 10(-8)) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For rs5945326 near DUSP9 on the X-chromosome we stratified according to sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male carriers of the risk allele showed nominally decreased BIGTT-AIR (2.6%, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No associations with intermediate metabolic traits were found in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the remaining ten lead variants no consistent associations were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Of the lead variants from 12 novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated loci, CENTD2 significantly associated with increased plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values and decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release, suggesting that the diabetogenic effect of this locus is mediated through an impaired pancreatic beta cell function </plain></SENT>
