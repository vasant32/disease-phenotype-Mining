<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients (age 54 years, BMI 29 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2)) and ten matched control subjects were studied at baseline (after an overnight fast) and during insulin infusions of 20- and 40-mU </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic patients, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were normalized overnight before the studies by low-dose insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hepatic sinusoidal insulin levels were estimated, and plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) and glucagon were determined to assess the direct and indirect effects of insulin on hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (HGP) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, a marked defect in the direct (hepatic) effect of insulin on HGP appeared to be present at low insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in response to a small increase in baseline hepatic sinusoidal insulin levels of 11 mU/l (26 +/- 3 to 37 +/- 3 mU/l, P &lt; 0.05) in the 20-mU clamp, a marked suppression of HGP was observed in the diabetic patients (86 +/- 3 to 32 +/- 5 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>min(-1), P &lt; 0.001), despite only minimal changes in FFAs (0.33 +/- 0.05 to 0.25 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, NS) and glucagon (14 +/- 1 to 11 +/- 2 pmol/l, P &lt; 0.05) levels, suggesting that the impairment in the direct effect of insulin can be overcome by a small increase in insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, suppression of HGP in the diabetic patients was slightly impaired in the 20-mU clamp (32 +/- 5 vs. 22 +/- 4 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>min(-1), P &lt; 0.05) but not in the 40-mU clamp (25 +/- 2 vs. 21 +/- 3 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>min(-1), NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the 20-mU clamp, hepatic sinusoidal insulin levels in the diabetic patients were comparable with control subjects (37 +/- 3 vs. 36 +/- 3 mU/l, NS), whereas both FFA and glucagon levels were higher (i.e., less suppressed) and correlated with the rates of HGP (R = 0.71, P &lt; 0.02; and R = 0.69, P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thus, at this insulin level impaired indirect (extrahepatic) effects of insulin seemed to prevail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is present in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients but is of quantitative significance only at low physiological insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Defects in both the direct and the indirect effects of insulin on HGP appear to contribute to this resistance </plain></SENT>
