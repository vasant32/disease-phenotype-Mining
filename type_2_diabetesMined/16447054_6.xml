<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the study period 1983-1999, 6,771 incident cases were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was made by linking the records to the nationwide Cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With an average follow-up of 8.5 years, resulting in 59,231 person-years, 159 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was reported as the underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 51 patients (32%), and as a contributing cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in another 42 patients (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was significantly elevated (RR=2.4; 95% CI: 2.0-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SMR was higher for patients classified by the reporting physician as having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at diagnosis than for those classified as type 1 diabetic (2.9 and 1.8, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis showed significant differences in survival curves between males and females (p=0.0003) as well as between cases with different types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This pattern was also reflected in the Cox regression model showing significantly increased hazard for males vs females (p=0.0002), and for type 2 vs type 1 (p=0.015) when controlling for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study shows a two-fold excess mortality in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a three-fold excess mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite advances in treatment, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> still carries an increased mortality in young adults, even in a country with a good economic and educational patient status and easy access to health care </plain></SENT>
