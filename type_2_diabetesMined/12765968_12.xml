<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, the IRS-2 Gly1057Asp substitution was associated with lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in lean individuals, but with a higher risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of IRS-2 on the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Pima Indians, and particularly to investigate whether the effects of the Gly1057Asp polymorphism on metabolism are mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, molecular scanning of the gene for mutations was performed and interaction of the polymorphism with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified the previously described Gly1057Asp mutation as well as a rare Asp819His mutation and four silent polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of the Gly1057Asp mutation on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was tested in a large cohort of Pima Indians (n = 998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of nondiabetic full-heritage Pima Indians (n = 233) had measurements of body composition, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin action (M), endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (EGP; hyperinsulinemic clamp), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR, 25-g intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, n = 118 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects), and percutaneous fat biopsy specimens from the periumbilical region (n = 160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 132 nondiabetic subjects were included in longitudinal analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the Asp1057 allele was 0.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cross-sectional analyses, subjects homozygous for the Asp1057 allele (Asp/Asp) had a higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than heterozygote individuals and subjects homozygous for the Gly1057 allele (X/Gly, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no effect on BMI (P = 0.78) or gene-BMI interaction on the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the nondiabetic subgroup, subjects with Asp/Asp had higher percent body fat (P = 0.01), BMI (P = 0.02), and waist circumference (P = 0.004), but there was no difference in metabolic characteristics (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between percent body fat and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, basal EGP, EGP during the clamp, AIR, and subcutaneous abdominal adipocyte size was significantly different in the Asp/Asp group (P for interaction = 0.02, 0.06, 0.0007, 0.08, and 0.006, respectively) compared with the X/Gly group, suggesting a more detrimental effect of Asp homozygosity on these traits with increasing percent body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In longitudinal analyses, among subjects in the upper tertile of change in percent body fat, those with Asp/Asp had a larger increase in fasting and postprandial glycemia and basal EGP and a larger decrease in M and AIR than subjects with X/Gly, independent of change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings suggest that the association of homozygosity for the Asp1057 allele in IRS-2 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians may be mediated by interaction of the polymorphism with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on several <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits </plain></SENT>
