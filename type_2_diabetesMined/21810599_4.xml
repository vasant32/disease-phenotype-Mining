<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Zinc is an essential micronutrient that is important for β-cell function and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that zinc intake could influence the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-raising effect of specific variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a 14-cohort meta-analysis to assess the interaction of 20 genetic variants known to be related to glycemic traits and zinc metabolism with dietary zinc intake (food sources) and a 5-cohort meta-analysis to assess the interaction with total zinc intake (food sources and supplements) on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels among individuals of European ancestry without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a significant association of total zinc intake with lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (β-coefficient ± SE per 1 mg/day of zinc intake: -0.0012 ± 0.0003 mmol/L, summary P value = 0.0003), while the association of dietary zinc intake was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified a nominally significant interaction between total zinc intake and the SLC30A8 rs11558471 variant on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (β-coefficient ± SE per A allele for 1 mg/day of greater total zinc intake: -0.0017 ± 0.0006 mmol/L, summary interaction P value = 0.005); this result suggests a stronger inverse association between total zinc intake and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in individuals carrying the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-raising A allele compared with individuals who do not carry it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the other interaction tests were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher total zinc intake may attenuate the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-raising effect of the rs11558471 SLC30A8 (zinc transporter) variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings also support evidence for the association of higher total zinc intake with lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
