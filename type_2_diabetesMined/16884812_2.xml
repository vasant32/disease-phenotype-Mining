<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and the impact of treatment with anti-depressants on this association in older males with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from the electronic medical record system of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in a large mid-western city in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 8185 males older than 40, with a history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who had visited the VAMC within the previous 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were used to measure bivariate associations; multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustments for confounding variables, significant associations were found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and any adverse heart event (OR=1.34, p=0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (OR=1.23, p=0.039), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI; OR=1.77, p&lt;0.001), and angioplasty (OR=1.36, p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examination of the interaction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and anti-depressant prescription status indicated that, except for MI, these associations were no longer significant among those who had been prescribed anti-depressants, but remained significant and were increased in magnitude among those who had not been prescribed anti-depressants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the premise that co-morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in diabetics is associated with the occurrence of adverse heart events, and further suggest that treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with anti-depressants moderates this association </plain></SENT>
