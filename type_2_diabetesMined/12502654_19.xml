<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a controlled clinical study to determine whether a community-based, group-centered public health intervention addressing nutrition and exercise can ameliorate glycemic control and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients in rural Costa Rica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 75 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, mean age 59 years, were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants received basic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects in the intervention group participated in 11 weekly nutrition classes (90 min each session) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects for whom exercise was deemed safe also participated in triweekly walking groups (60 min each session) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, height, weight, BMI, and blood pressure were measured at baseline and the end of the study (after 12 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intervention group lost 1.0 +/- 2.2 kg compared with a <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in the control group of 0.4 +/- 2.3 kg (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased 19 +/- 55 mg/dl in the intervention group and increased 16 +/- 78 mg/dl in the control group (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> decreased 1.8 +/- 2.3% in the intervention group and 0.4 +/- 2.3% in the control group (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control of type 2 diabetic patients can be improved through community-based, group-centered public health interventions addressing nutrition and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This pilot study provides an economically feasible model for programs that aim to improve the health status of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
