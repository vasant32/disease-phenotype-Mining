<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 13 free-living men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or persistently <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> participated in a randomized crossover study in which three- and nine-meal regimes were followed for 4-week periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations were measured at weekly intervals and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> responses following a 75-g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load at weeks 2 and 4 of each diet period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake was also recorded during these weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nutrient intakes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of carbohydrate and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism were similar on the three- and nine-meal regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This longer-term study could not confirm the potential benefits of increased meal frequency suggested by comparable 4-week studies in type 2 diabetic individuals and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> experiments in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, as there were no adverse effects of consuming nine meals per day, it would seem appropriate that meal frequency in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be left to personal choice, provided that energy balance is maintained </plain></SENT>
