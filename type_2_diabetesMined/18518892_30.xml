<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> in this patient population was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 54-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients with baseline glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) values of 6.5-10% were allocated (2:1) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (for 54 weeks) or the sequence of placebo (for 12 weeks) followed by active treatment with glipizide (for 42 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To achieve plasma concentrations similar to those observed in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function treated with 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> once daily, patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> were allocated to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 50 mg once daily and patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> to receive 25 mg once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glipizide treatment was initiated at 2.5 or 5 mg/day and uptitrated to a maximum of 20 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients (N = 91) with a mean baseline HbA(1c) value of 7.7% (range: 6.2-10.3%) were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (n = 65) or placebo (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, the mean change [95% confidence interval (CI)] from baseline in HbA(1c) was -0.6% (-0.8, -0.4) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group compared with -0.2% (-0.4, 0.1) in the placebo group [between-group difference (95% CI) = -0.4% (-0.7, -0.1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 54 weeks, patients continuously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> had a mean change (95% CI) from baseline in HbA(1c) of -0.7% (-0.9, -0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of adverse experiences was generally similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Between-group differences in incidences of specific clinical adverse experiences were generally small; however, the proportion of patients for whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reported was lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group (4.6%) compared with the placebo/glipizide group (23.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the high mortality risk in this patient population, there were six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during this 54-week study [5 of 65 patients (7.7%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group and 1 of 26 patients (3.8%) in the placebo/glipizide group]; no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was considered by the investigator to be drug related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall incidences of drug-related and serious adverse experiences and discontinuations because of adverse experiences were generally similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was generally well tolerated and provided effective glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, including patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> on dialysis </plain></SENT>
