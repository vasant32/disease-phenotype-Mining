<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exhibit a high risk of developing severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> on atherogenesis in Apoe (-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Apoe (-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet and treated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or placebo for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaque size and plaque composition were analysed using Oil Red O staining and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro experiments with the modified Boyden chamber and with gelatine zymography were performed to analyse the effects of GLP-1 on isolated human monocyte migration and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of Apoe (-/-) mice with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> significantly reduced plaque macrophage infiltration (the aortic root and aortic arch both showing a 67% decrease; p &lt; 0.05) and plaque MMP-9 levels (aortic root showing a 69% and aortic arch a 58% reduction; both p &lt; 0.01) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> significantly increased plaque collagen content more than twofold (aortic root showing an increase of 58% and aortic arch an increase of 73%; both p &lt; 0.05) compared with controls but did not change overall lesion size (8.1 ± 3.5% vs 5.1 ± 2.5% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> vs controls; p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, pretreatment of isolated human monocytes with GLP-1 significantly decreased cell migration induced by both monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and by the protein known as regulated on activation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GLP-1 significantly decreased MMP-9 release from isolated human monocyte-derived macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> reduces plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and increases plaque stability, potentially by GLP-1-mediated inhibition of chemokine-induced monocyte migration and macrophage MMP-9 release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects observed may provide potential mechanisms for how DPP-IV inhibitors could modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in high-risk patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
