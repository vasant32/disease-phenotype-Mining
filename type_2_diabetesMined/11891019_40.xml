<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of an 8 week circuit training (CT) program, combining aerobic and resistance exercise, on indices of glycemic control, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and body composition in 16 subjects (age 52 +/- 2 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a prospective randomised crossover protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Submaximal exercise heart rate and rate pressure product were significantly lower after training (P&lt;0.05), whilst ventilatory threshold increased (11.8 +/- 0.7 vs 13.8 +/- 0.6 ml kg(-1)min(-1), P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscular strength also increased with training (403 +/- 30 to 456 +/- 31 kg, P&lt;0.001), whilst skinfolds (148.7 +/- 11.5 vs 141.1 +/- 10.7 mm, P&lt;0.05), % body fat (29.5 +/- 1.0 vs 28.7 +/- 1.1%, P&lt;0.05) and waist:hip ratio (99.2 +/- 1.5 vs 97.9 +/- 1.4%, P&lt;0.05) significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, peak oxygen uptake (P&lt;0.05) and exercise test duration (P&lt;0.001) increased following training, whilst glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT is an effective method of training that improved functional capacity, lean body mass, strength and glycemic control in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
