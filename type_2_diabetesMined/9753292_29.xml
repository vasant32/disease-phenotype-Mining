<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether selective beta3-adrenoceptor stimulation exerts metabolic actions in humans remains to be proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of a highly selective beta3-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> on insulin action, energy metabolism, and body composition were assessed in 14 healthy young lean male volunteers (age 22.5 +/- 3.3 years, 15 +/- 5% body fat [mean +/- SD]) randomly assigned to 8 weeks of treatment with either 1,500 mg/day of CL 316,243 (n = 10) or placebo (n = 4) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 24-h energy expenditure (24-EE), 24-h respiratory quotient (24-RQ), and the oxidation rates of fat and carbohydrate were determined in a respiratory chamber before and after 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, treatment with CL 316,243 increased IMGD (+45%, P &lt; 0.01) in a plasma concentration-dependent manner (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was due to an 82% increase in NOGD (P &lt; 0.01), while OGD and SGO remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects on insulin action were markedly diminished after 8 weeks; this was significantly related to an unexpected decline in the plasma concentrations of CL 316,243 (-36%, P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At this time, 24-RQ was lowered (P &lt; 0.001), corresponding to a 23% increase in fat oxidation (P &lt; 0.01) and a 17% decrease in carbohydrate oxidation (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 24-EE after 8 weeks did not differ from baseline, and there was no change in body weight or body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and leptin were unaffected by treatment, while free fatty acid concentrations increased by 41% (P &lt; 0.05), again linearly with the achieved plasma concentration of CL 316,243 (r = 0.67, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CL 316,243 had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure and caused no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that treatment of lean male subjects with CL 316,243 increases insulin action and fat oxidation, both in a plasma concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to demonstrate unequivocal metabolic effects of a highly selective beta3-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> in humans </plain></SENT>
