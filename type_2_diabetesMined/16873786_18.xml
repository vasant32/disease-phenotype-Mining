<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety profile of adding inhaled human insulin (INH) (Exubera) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy in patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an open-label, parallel, 24-week multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients uncontrolled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were randomized to adjunctive INH (n = 243) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (n = 233) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before randomization, patients were divided into two HbA(1c) (A1C) arms: &gt; or =8 to &lt; or =9.5% (moderately high) and &gt;9.5 to &lt; or =12% (very high) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was A1C change from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean adjusted A1C changes from baseline were -2.03 and -1.88% in the INH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> groups, respectively; between-treatment difference -0.17% (95% CI -0.34 to 0.01; P = 0.058), consistent with the noninferiority criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the A1C &gt;9.5% arm, inhaled insulin demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in A1C than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, between-treatment difference -0.37% (-0.62 to -0.12; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the A1C &lt; or =9.5% arm, between-treatment difference was 0.04% (-0.19 to 0.27; P = 0.733) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (events per subject-month) was greater with INH (0.18) than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (0.08), risk ratio 2.24 (1.58-3.16), but there were no associated discontinuations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other adverse events, except increased cough in the INH group, were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At week 24, changes from baseline in pulmonary function parameters were small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin antibody binding increased more with INH but did not have any associated clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> poorly controlled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, adding INH or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> was similarly effective in improving glycemic control, and both were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A predefined subgroup with very high A1C (&gt;9.5%) was more effectively treated with the addition of INH </plain></SENT>
