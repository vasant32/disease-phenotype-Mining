<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relaxin concentration was measured in plasma in 63 newly diagnosed women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also measured body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, parameters of metabolic control (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, HbA1c, total, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> according to the homeostasis model assessment index 2 (HOMA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relaxin was positively related to insulin sensitivity (R=0.316 and p=0.01) and negatively to beta-cell (-0.382 and p=0.004) function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that the correlation between relaxin and HOMA2%B remained significant after adjustment for age, BMI (R(2)=0.253 and p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data raise the possibility that a gender-related hormonal mechanism may influence beta-cell function in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
