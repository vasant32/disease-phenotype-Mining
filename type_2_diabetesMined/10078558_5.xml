<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We and others have shown that insulin acutely suppresses <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in fasting nondiabetic humans and dogs, by both a direct hepatic effect and an indirect (extrahepatic) effect, and in diabetic dogs by an indirect effect alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there is resistance to insulin's ability to suppress hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, but it has not previously been determined whether the resistance is primarily at the level of the hepatocyte or the peripheral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the diabetic state reduces the direct effect of insulin in humans, we studied nine patients with untreated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who underwent three studies each, 4-6 weeks apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1) Portal study (POR): intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> was infused for 3 h with calculation of pancreatic insulin secretion from peripheral plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2) Peripheral study (PER): equidose insulin was infused by peripheral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3) Half-dose peripheral insulin study (1/2 PER): matched peripheral insulin levels with study 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was clamped at euglycemia, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover was measured with the constant specific activity method, and 3-[3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral insulin was lower in POR versus PER but slightly higher in POR versus 1/2 PER, although most of the difference could be accounted for by higher proinsulin levels in POR (stimulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calculated portal insulin was approximately 1.3-fold higher in POR versus PER and approximately 2.2-fold higher in POR versus 1/2 PER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the final 30 min of the clamp, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production reached a lower steady-state level in PER than in POR (4.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.5 pmol(-1) x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.05), despite the higher hepatic insulin level in POR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast with our studies in nondiabetic individuals, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was not more suppressed at steady state in POR versus 1/2 PER (5.3 +/- 0.4 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)), despite much higher hepatic insulin levels in POR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this is the first study in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> direct suppressive effect of insulin on hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
