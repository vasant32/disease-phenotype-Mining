<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVEPatients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and insulin therapy with human insulin were usually instructed to use an interval of 20-30 min between the injection and meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the necessity of the injection-to-meal interval (IMI) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and flexible insulin therapy with human insulin.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn this randomized, open crossover trial, 100 patients with T2DM (47% men, mean age = 66.7 years) were randomized to the IMI first group (phase 1, IMI 20 min; phase 2, no IMI) or IMI last group (phase 1, no IMI; phase 2, IMI 20 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were HbA(1c), blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and patient preference.RESULTSForty-nine patients were randomized to the IMI first group and 51 patients to the IMI last group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Omitting the IMI only slightly increases HbA(1c) (average intraindividual difference = 0.08% [CI 0.01-0.15]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the difference is not clinically relevant, a therapy without IMI is noninferior to its application (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the secondary outcomes, the incidence of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> also did not differ between no IMI and IMI significantly (mean of differences = -0.10, P = 0.493) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile of both groups was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction increased markedly, by 8.08, if IMI was omitted (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total score of the quality of life measure did not show differences between applying an IMI or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin therapy without IMI was preferred by 86.5% of patients (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONSAn IMI for patients with T2DM and preprandial insulin therapy is not necessary </plain></SENT>
