<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured WC and visceral fat area (VFA) in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) and assessed the propriety of new criteria of MetS in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and nineteen patients (M/F: 258/161, age: 60.4+/-0.7 years, BMI: 24.4+/-0.2 kg/m(2)) who received abdominal CT examination were analyzed, and 178 (M/F: 111/67) subjects sufficed the criteria of MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average VFA was significantly larger in subjects with MetS (162+/-3 cm(2) versus 82+/-3 cm(2), p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The WC and VFA were correlated significantly in both male (r=0.78, p&lt;0.001) and female (r=0.82, p&lt;0.001), and corresponding VFA at 85 cm of WC in male and at 90 cm in female were 125 cm(2) and 120 cm(2) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present cross-sectional study strongly suggests that the recommended WC is not suitable to define the current criteria of MetS (VFA, &gt; or =100 cm(2)) and its criteria is not appropriate to segregate a risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in Japanese T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further prospective analysis should be required to validate the criteria and clinical significance of MetS in T2DM </plain></SENT>
