<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our previous data, we designed a high-protein/low-carbohydrate, weight-maintaining, nonketogenic diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in people with untreated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We refer to this as a low-biologically-available-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (LoBAG) diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight men were studied using a randomized 5-week crossover design with a 5-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The carbohydrate:protein:fat ratio of the control diet was 55:15:30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The test diet ratio was 20:30:50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma and urinary beta-hydroxybutyrate were similar on both diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean 24-h integrated serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at the end of the control and LoBAG diets was 198 and 126 mg/dl, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of glycohemoglobin was 9.8 +/- 0.5 and 7.6 +/- 0.3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was still decreasing at the end of the LoBAG diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the final calculated glycohemoglobin was estimated to be approximately 6.3-5.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin was decreased, and plasma glucagon was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, a LoBAG diet ingested for 5 weeks dramatically reduced the circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration in people with untreated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Potentially, this could be a patient-empowering way to ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> without pharmacological intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The long-term effects of such a diet remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
