<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is a lack of information on associations between NAFLD and microvascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the associations between NAFLD and both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic individuals using a cross-sectional design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (by ophthalmoscopy) and CKD (defined as overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and/or estimated GFR &lt;or= 60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) were assessed in 2,103 type 2 diabetic individuals who were free of diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NAFLD was ascertained by patient history, blood sampling and liver ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NAFLD patients had higher (p&lt;0.001) age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates of both non-proliferative (39 vs 34%) and proliferative/laser-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (11 vs 5%), and CKD (15 vs 9%) than counterparts without NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression analysis, NAFLD was associated with increased rates of CKD (odds ratio 1.87; 95% CI 1.3-4.1, p=0.020) and proliferative/laser-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.75; 1.1-3.7, p=0.031) independently of age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, smoking status and medications use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that NAFLD is associated with an increased prevalence of CKD and proliferative/laser-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic individuals independently of numerous baseline confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to confirm the reproducibility of these results and to evaluate whether NAFLD contributes to the development or progression of CKD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
