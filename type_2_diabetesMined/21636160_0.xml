<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine male patients with T2D, 44 male subjects with IGT and 58 subjects with NGT matched for age, weight and body mass index (BMI) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was obtained with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, muscle fibre distribution with a biopsy and exercise capacity from an incremental exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements as height, weight, waist and hip circumference were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were small differences between groups in waist hip ratio (WHR) with significance attained between NGT and T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive reduction in exercise capacity, both expressed as VO(2peak) and work rate from subjects with NGT to IGT to T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis with VO(2peak) as dependent variable showed insulin sensitivity to be the most important factor followed by Type I fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WHR and capillary density also influenced the variance of VO(2peak) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exercise capacity is independently related to insulin sensitivity, muscle fibre composition and WHR in subjects with NGT, IGT and T2D who are matched for age and BMI </plain></SENT>
