<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our model of early-life stress (variable foraging demand [VFD]), food insecurity is imposed on monkey mothers for 16 weeks beginning when their nursing offspring are 3-5 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under VFD, food availability is never restricted, and the infant's growth is unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VFD rearing does, however, cause a range of neurobiological abnormalities, including dysregulation of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis, manifested in abnormal cerebrospinal fluid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and corticotropin-releasing factor levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We previously reported spontaneous occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in 14% of normally reared peripubertal bonnet macaques given ad libitum access to standard monkey chow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that compared with normally reared monkeys, peripubertal VFD juveniles exhibit greater weight, BMI, abdominal circumference, and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 and decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that early-life stress during a critical period of neuro development can result in the peripubertal emergence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
