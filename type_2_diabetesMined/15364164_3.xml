<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A correlation study using the Health Belief Model (HBM) framework was undertaken with 128 Chinese subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> of both gender, mean age 60.5 +/- 8.42 years from one urban hospital and four rural health centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Research tool was a 60-item questionnaire with responses recorded on 5-point Likert scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data was analyzed with descriptive statistics, Spearmen correlation and Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of the subjects had less than 6 years of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two percent of them were aware of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications and its risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, few subjects practiced complication preventive measures because of lack of perceived seriousness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and lack of perceived susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between complication prevention behaviors and perceived severity (P &lt; 0.05), perceived susceptibility (P &lt; 0.05 ) and perceived barrier (P &lt; 0.05 ); subjects' education level and perceived severity (P &lt; 0.05), perceived susceptibility (P &lt; 0.05) and complication prevention behavior (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between health beliefs and settings; genders; disease duration and treatment mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, poor complication preventive behavior among the subjects was associated with lack of perceived seriousness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and lack of perceived susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
