<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of pinitol therapy in type 2 diabetic patients who were poorly controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drugs</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled in our study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipocytokines, such as adiponectin, leptin, free fatty acids, and c-reactive protein (CRP) were checked before and after pinitol treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After pinitol treatment, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum adiponectin, leptin, free fatty acid, and CRP levels did not change after pinitol treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the unresponsive group, serum c-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were higher than in the responsive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve weeks of pinitol treatment altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, but not <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles or adipocytokine levels, in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
