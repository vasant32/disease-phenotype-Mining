<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altered endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> metabolism, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35346">11beta-hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), which generates active <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi>, and 5alpha-reductase (5alphaR), which inactivates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, has been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 101 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (mean age 48 +/- 7 years, BMI 34.4 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), 66 women, 35 men) underwent 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing (OGTT), body composition analysis (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), assessment of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> metabolism (24-h urine steroid metabolite analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 22.7% of women had IGT compared with 34.2% of men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two women and five men were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In women, adipose 11beta-HSD1 expression was increased in patients with IGT and correlated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels across the OGTT (R = 0.44, P &lt; 0.001) but was independent of fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> secretion was higher in men with and without IGT (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 13,743 +/- 863 vs. 7,453 +/- 469 microg/24 h, P &lt; 0.001; IGT 16,871 +/- 2,113 vs. 10,133 +/- 1,488 microg/24 h, P &lt; 0.05), and in women, it was higher in those with IGT (7,453 +/- 469 vs. 10,133 +/- 1,488 microg/24 h, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both sexes, 5alphaR activity correlated with fasting insulin (men R = 0.53, P = 0.003; women R = 0.33, P = 0.02), insulin secretion across an OGTT (men R = 0.46, P = 0.01; women R = 0.40, P = 0.004), and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (men R = 0.52, P = 0.004; women R = 0.33, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased adipose 11beta-HSD1 expression in women may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enhanced 5alphaR activity in both sexes is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> but not body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Augmented <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> inactivation may serve as a compensatory, protective mechanism to preserve insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
