<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the validity and reliability of the short-form 12-Item Well-Being Questionnaire (W-BQ12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 12 items were used to construct the three 4-item subscales Negative Well-Being (NWB), Energy (ENE), and Positive Well-Being (PWB), and the 12-item overall scale General Well-Being (GWB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,472 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed the W-BQ12, the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale, and the State Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistics covered Cronbach's alpha, Pearson's correlation, t tests, and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Test-retest reliability was studied in a sample of 202 patients who twice completed the W-BQ12, which was supplemented with the Center for Epidemiological Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale and the Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the tested subjects, 739 were defined as having type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 701 as having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cronbach's alpha proved to be high and stable across sex and type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> W-BQ12 scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Test-retest reliability ranged from 0.66 (PWB) to 0.83 (GWB), with a mean interval of 66 +/- 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Convergent validity of the W-BQ12 scales was supported by high correlations with other measures of affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scales of the first measurement, ENE proved to have the strongest association with self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NWB and trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> both had the strongest associations with self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and current treatment by a psychologist/psychiatrist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The W-BQ12 appeared to be a reliable and valid measure of psychological well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This short instrument is easy to administer and may be considered a useful tool for both clinicians and researchers to assess the psychological well-being of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
