<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study in Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> was conducted in <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> patients to determine if a significant difference in HbA1c could be achieved between groups receiving standard and intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed differences in the response to exogenous insulin between African-Americans and other intensively treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the variations of response and correlated factors that might explain such differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-three men aged 40-69 years with <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> for &lt; or = 15 years were randomized to either the standard therapy (n = 78) or the intensive therapy (n = 75) arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 75 patients in the intensive therapy group, 57 completed the study on insulin therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 18 were African-Americans and 39 were non-African-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conducted an analysis of the data collected to determine differences in baseline characteristics, glycemic response, insulin requirement, body weight, exercise, and basal C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level, factors that may explain a difference in response to insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycemic control improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with intensive insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>African-Americans achieved a greater improvement in HbA1c compared with non-African-Americans with a similar increment in insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference could not be explained by differences in body weight, activity, concomitant use of other medicines, or insulin-secretory capacity of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ethnic differences may exist in the response to insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A knowledge of such differences may aid in achieving good glycemic control, especially since minorities have a greater prevalence of and burden from the microvascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
