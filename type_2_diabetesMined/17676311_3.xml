<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unknown whether the same overall phenomenon occurs in other patients taking <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy, such as patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 30 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (mean age 43.5 +/- 10.8 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43755">lisinopril</z:chebi> (20 mg/day) as part of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the course of the 18 month study, we made measurements at 0, 9 and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These measurements included plasma values for components of the renin-angiotensin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we infused AI and AII into the brachial arteries of patients to assess vascular tissue AI to AII conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant changes in plasma renin activity, ACE, AI, AII or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, vascular AI to AII conversion was significantly (p = 0.01) greater at 18 months than at 0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no change over time in the response to infused AII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have shown in vivo that vascular tissue AI to AII conversion gradually increases over time in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> being treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43755">lisinopril</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine whether this reactivation detracts from the cardioprotective effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy in diabetic patients, and if so, how best to overcome it </plain></SENT>
