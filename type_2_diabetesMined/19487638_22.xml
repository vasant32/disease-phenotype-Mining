<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We evaluated the association of the DASH diet with incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among 862 participants of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) who completed a 1-year food frequency questionnaire at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> odds ratios (ORs) were estimated at tertiles of the DASH score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS An inverse association was observed in whites (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.29-1.48]) that became significant for the most extreme contrast (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 0.31 [0.13-0.75]), with adjustment for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No association was observed in blacks or Hispanics (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, 1.16 [0.61-2.18 ]; tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 1.34 [0.70-2.58 ]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Adherence to the DASH dietary pattern, which is rich in vegetables, fruit, and low-fat dairy products, may have the potential to prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
