<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate glycemic control using convenience-oriented biphasic insulin analog compared with intensified insulin therapy, we conducted a 6-month multicentric, open-label, randomized trial in Japanese insulin-naive patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 160 adult patients at 19 centers were randomized into two groups: those who received twice-daily injections of biphasic insulin aspart 30 and those on three-times-daily injections of insulin aspart with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (multiple daily injections) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, mean HbA(1c) decreased by approximately 2.5% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction of HbA(1c) on both regimens was better in patients whose prior therapy before starting the study was only diet and exercise (-5.0%) than in patients who were previously taking oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents (-1.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No incidence of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was observed in either regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that convenience-oriented insulin therapy using biphasic insulin analog is as useful as intensified insulin therapy with insulin analog for the treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> over 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, early induction of insulin therapy in individuals hitherto using only diet and exercise may provide good glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that convenience-oriented biphasic insulin aspart 30 might be a useful option for the treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, especially for insulin-naive patients over 6 months, although it should be changed to another regimen when expected efficacy is not obtained </plain></SENT>
