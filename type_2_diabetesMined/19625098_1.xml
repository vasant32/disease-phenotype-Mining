<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1995 to 2001, we assessed cognitive function in 1,698 women aged 71-80 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessments were repeated twice at 2-year intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used linear regression to estimate multivariable-adjusted mean differences in initial cognitive function and longitudinal models to estimate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> over 4 years, according to average alcohol intake between diagnosis with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the initial cognitive measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the initial assessment, the mean score on our test of general cognition was 0.31 (95% CI 0.02, 0.60) points higher in women who were moderate alcohol drinkers (those consuming 1.0-9.9 g of alcohol, or about 1 drink, per day) compared with abstainers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, moderate alcohol was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher alcohol consumption (10.0-30.0 g of alcohol per day) was not associated with initial cognition or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, although there was no apparent harm either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, moderate alcohol was associated with better initial cognition, but not reduced rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we found no clear and consistent cognitive benefits of moderate alcohol in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
