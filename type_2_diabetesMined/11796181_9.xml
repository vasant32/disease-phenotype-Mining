<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15693">aldose</z:chebi> reductase, the enzyme that converts <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to sorbitol, may confer susceptibility to microvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study therefore, was to investigate the relationship between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15693">aldose</z:chebi> reductase gene and type 2 diabetic microvascular complications such as diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA from 127 Korean patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was typed for an (AC)(n) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat polymorphic marker at the 5'-end of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15693">aldose</z:chebi> reductase gene using polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the frequency of the putative risk allele Z-2 was found in patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> groups compared with the uncomplicated group (32.2, 34.1 vs. 25.1%, respectively, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no difference was found in the frequency of the putative protective allele Z+2 among any of the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of the study in Korean type 2 diabetic patients do not support the hypothesis that polymorphism at the 5' end of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15693">aldose</z:chebi> reductase gene contributes to the susceptibility to diabetic microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
