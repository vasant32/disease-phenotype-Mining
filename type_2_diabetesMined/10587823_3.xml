<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective observational study, 45 type 2 diabetic patients were examined at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after change to insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was graded on fundus photographs using the Wisconsin scale; HbA1c, IGF-1, and hemostatic variables were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the observation period of 2 years, 23 patients progressed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> scale; 8 progressed &gt; or = 3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 years of insulin treatment, HbA1c and IGF-1 were significantly lower than at baseline, whereas the hemostatic variables had not changed significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> &gt; or = 3 levels was related to the degree of HbA1c reduction, the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a higher prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 levels (F1 + 2), but not to other hemostatic variables or IGF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for progression &gt; or = 3 levels was 2.6 when HbA1c had been reduced &gt; or = 3 percent units (95% CI 1.1-6.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of improvement of HbA1c by the institution of insulin treatment over a 2-year period may be associated with progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
