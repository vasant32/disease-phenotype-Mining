<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent and nature of such activation in type 2 diabetic patients who do not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> have not yet been addressed despite evidence relating sympathetic activation to cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We planned to determine the magnitude and extent of the sympathetic drive and its reflex responses in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) as the mean frequency of multi-unit bursts and single unit muscle sympathetic nerve activity (s-MSNA) in 17 overweight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and two matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control groups comprising 17 overweight and 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also tested the MSNA and s-MSNA responses to cold pressor and isometric hand-grip tests, along with the effect of sympatho-vagal balance on heart period variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both MSNA and s-MSNA in the group with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (66+/-3.5 bursts/100 beats and 78+/-4.5 impulses/100 beats) were greater (at least p&lt;0.0001) than in the overweight control group (42+/-2.6 bursts/100 beats and 48+/-3.4 impulses/100 beats) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight control group (43+/-6.2 bursts/100 beats and 51+/-7.1 impulses/100 beats), though the three groups had similar reflex responses, baroreflex sensitivity and sympatho-vagal balance controlling the heart period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had no evidence of impaired reflex or autonomic control of heart period variability at a time when there was central sympathetic activation to the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, being overweight itself was not associated with sympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
