<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) are widely used for controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> has also been reported to have an adverse effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on adipocytes, which play pivotal roles in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 3T3-L1 cells, effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on adipocyte maturation were determined morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of SLC2A4 and adipocyte marker proteins were determined by immunoblotting and RT-PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic NSY mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> for 15 weeks, followed by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance tests and examination of SLC2A4 expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (10 mg/day), and its effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and glycaemic profiles were measured 12 weeks after treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> inhibited adipocyte maturation, SLC2A4 and C/EBPalpha expressions and insulin action in 3T3-L1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> also attenuated SLC2A4 and C/EBPalpha expressions in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects were reversed by L. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi> or geranylgeranyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In NSY mice, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and decreased SLC2A4 expression in WAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to improving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased HbA(1c) but not fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in diabetic patients, and this effect was greater in the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> attenuates adipocyte maturation and SLC2A4 expression by inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24913">isoprenoid</z:chebi> biosynthesis, and impairs <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> could potentially affect the control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
