<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An important question in human genetics is the extent to which genes causing monogenic forms of disease harbor common variants that may contribute to the more typical form of that disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the extent to which common variation in the six known <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) genes, which cause a monogenic form of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we determined patterns of common sequence variation in the genes encoding Gck, Ipf1, Tcf2, and NeuroD1 (MODY2 and MODY4-MODY6, respectively), selected a comprehensive set of 107 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that captured common variation, and genotyped each in 4,206 patients and control subjects from Sweden, Finland, and Canada (including family-based studies and unrelated case-control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SNPs with a nominal P value &lt;0.1 for association to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this initial screen were then genotyped in an additional 4,470 subjects from North America and Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 30 nominally significant SNPs from the initial sample, 8 achieved consistent results in the replication sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found the strongest effect at rs757210 in intron 2 of TCF2, with corrected P values &lt;0.01 for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association was observed again in an independent sample of 5,891 unrelated case and control subjects and 500 families from the U.K., for an overall OR of 1.12 and a P value &lt;10(-6) in &gt;15,000 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We combined these results with our previous studies on HNF4alpha and TCF1 and explicitly tested for gene-gene interactions among these variants and with several known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility loci, and we found no genetic interactions between these six genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although rare variants in these six genes explain most cases of MODY, common variants in these same genes contribute very modestly, if at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, to the common form of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
