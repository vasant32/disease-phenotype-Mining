<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 109 patients (41-74 years old) with established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who abstained from alcohol to receive 150 ml wine (13 g alcohol) or nonalcoholic diet beer (control) each day during a 3-month multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The beverages were consumed during dinner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diet and alcohol consumption were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the intervention, 17% of participants (12% from the alcohol group) dropped out, leaving 91 who completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the alcohol group, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) decreased from 139.6 +/- 41 to 118.0 +/- 32.5 mg/dl after 3 months compared with 136.7 +/- 15.4 to 138.6 +/- 27.8 mg/dl in the control subjects (P(v) = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, alcohol consumption had no effect on 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (difference of 18.5 mg/dl in the control group vs. 17.7 mg/dl in the alcohol group, P(v) = 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the alcohol group with higher baseline A1C levels had greater reductions in FPG (age-adjusted correlation -0.57, P(v) &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed in the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase, and no notable adverse effects were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants in the alcohol group reported an improvement in the ability to fall asleep (P(v) &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had previously abstained from alcohol, initiation of moderate daily alcohol consumption reduced FPG but not postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher A1C may benefit more from the favorable glycemic effect of alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further intervention studies are needed to confirm the long-term effect of moderate alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
