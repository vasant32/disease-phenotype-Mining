<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in subjects with T2DM and stage 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> [CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 and &lt;50 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, subjects (N = 269) received canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prespecified secondary endpoints were change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and proportion of subjects reaching HbA1c &lt;7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety was assessed based on adverse event (AE) reports; renal safety parameters (e.g. eGFR, blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen and albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio) were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg reduced HbA1c from baseline compared with placebo at week 26 (-0.33, -0.44 and -0.03%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numerical reductions in FPG and higher proportions of subjects reaching HbA1c &lt; 7.0% were observed with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo (27.3, 32.6 and 17.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall AE rates were similar for canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo (78.9, 74.2 and 74.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Slightly higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> and AEs related to osmotic <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> and reduced intravascular volume were observed with canagliflozin 300 mg compared with other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transient changes in renal function parameters that trended towards baseline over 26 weeks were observed with canagliflozin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Canagliflozin improved glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated in subjects with T2DM and Stage 3 CKD </plain></SENT>
