<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore analysed the relationship between the gene expression profile in the liver and the pathophysiology of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Liver biopsy samples were obtained from twelve patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and from nine non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assay gene expression globally in the livers of both groups, we made complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays consisting of 1080 human cDNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative expression ratios of individual genes were obtained by comparing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52295">cyanine</z:chebi> 5-labelled cDNA from the patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52295">cyanine</z:chebi> 3-labelled cDNA from reference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from the liver of a non-diabetic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On assessing the similarities of differentially expressed genes, the gene expression profiles of the twelve diabetic patients formed a separate cluster from those of the non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 1080 genes assayed, 105 (9.7%) were up-regulated and 134 (12%) were down-regulated in the diabetic livers (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genes up-regulated in the diabetic patients included those encoding angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelin and platelet-derived growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also included TGF superfamily genes such as TGFA and TGFB1 as well as bone morphogenetic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the down-regulated genes in the diabetic patients were molecules defending against stress, e.g. <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30527">flavin</z:chebi>-containing monooxygenase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that livers of patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have gene expression profiles indicative of an increased risk of systemic vascular complications </plain></SENT>
