<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: While the relevant role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) is well established in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, its contribution in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was associated with increased UAE in a large cohort of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 363 men and 349 women, aged 61 +/- 9 years, with a disease duration of 11 +/- 9 years and HbA(1c) levels of 8.6 +/- 2.0% were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was derived from the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA(IR)), and UAE was derived from the albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) defined as increased if the value was &gt; or =2.5 mg/mmol in men and &gt; or =3.5 mg/mmol in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACR was correlated with HOMA(IR) (r = 0.15, P = 0.0001), independently of age, disease duration, blood pressure, HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, waist circumference, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When the two sexes were investigated separately, a significant correlation between ACR and HOMA(IR) was reached in men (n = 363; r = 0.21, P = 0.0001) but not women (n = 349; r = 0.08, P = 0.14), suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and sex may interact (P for interaction = 0.04) in determining UAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When men were subgrouped into quartiles of HOMA(IR), those of the third and fourth quartile (i.e., the most insulin resistant) were at higher risk to have increased ACR than patients of the first quartile (third quartile: odds ratio 2.2 [95% CI 1.2-4.2], P = 0.01) (fourth quartile: 4.1 [2.2-7.9], P = 0.00002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, ACR was significantly higher in men with two or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (i.e., abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) than in men with fewer than two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (0.90 [0.2-115.1] vs. 1.56 [0.1-1367.6], respectively, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients, increased UAE is strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association seems to be stronger in men than in women </plain></SENT>
