<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many patients with early <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to identify clinical predictors of 1) worsening glycemic control and 2) medical treatment initiation in response to worsening glycemic control among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 5,804 type 2 diabetic patients seen at least twice between June 2005 and June 2006 within our 12-clinic primary care network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> progression (A1C &gt;or=7% or initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi>) over a 1-year follow-up period in 705 patients who had A1C &lt;7% and were not on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medications at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 200 patients in this group who progressed, we examined predictors of medical therapy initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, baseline A1C (P &lt; 0.0001), younger age (P = 0.04), and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (P = 0.03) were independent predictors of progression after adjusting for race, sex, and baseline <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each decade of increasing age reduced the risk of progression by 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each 1-lb increase in weight was associated with a 2% increased odds of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likelihood of medication initiation among progressors decreased by 40% (P = 0.02) with every decade of age and decreased by 2.3% (P = 0.02) with each 1-mg/dl decrease in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> level from baseline after adjusting for race, sex, and weight change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among untreated primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and A1C &lt;7%, younger patients and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> were more likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> progression and should be the focus of aggressive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
