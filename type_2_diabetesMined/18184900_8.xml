<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study is based on 7,348 individuals with a mean follow-up of 2.4 years after completing the EQ-5D questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate hazard ratios associated with EQ VAS scores after controlling for baseline covariates: age, sex, smoking status, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, A1C, systolic blood pressure, BMI, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and prior clinical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 10-point higher EQ VAS score was associated with a 6% (95% CI 1-11) lower risk of vascular events and a 22% (95% CI 15-28) lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-rated health profiles compiled using the EQ VAS provide valuable information on patient risk in addition to that determined from clinical risk factors alone </plain></SENT>
