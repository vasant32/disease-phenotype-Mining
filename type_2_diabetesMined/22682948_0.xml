<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is new evidence that too much sitting (also known as sedentary behavior - which involves very low energy expenditure, such as television viewing and desk-bound work) is adversely associated with health outcomes, including cardio-metabolic risk biomarkers, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and premature mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these detrimental associations remain even after accounting for time spent in leisure time physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe recent evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies that makes a persuasive case that too much sitting should now be considered an important stand-alone component of the physical activity and health equation, particularly in relation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We highlight directions for further research and consider some of the practical implications of focusing on too much sitting as a modifiable health risk </plain></SENT>
