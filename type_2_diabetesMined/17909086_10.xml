<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated long-term reliability of early glucometabolic classification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> by repeated oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A glucometabolic OGTT-based classification was obtained in 122 patients by measuring capillary whole-blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The classification was performed on three occasions, before hospital discharge and 3 and 12 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At discharge, 34, 31, and 34% were classified as having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively, and 93% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were still classified with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 27) or IGT (n = 12) after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The agreements between the OGTTs at discharge and 3 and 12 months were kappa = 0.35, P &lt; 0.001, and kappa = 0.43, P &lt; 0.001, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of an OGTT performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients at hospital discharge reliably informs on long-term glucometabolic state </plain></SENT>
