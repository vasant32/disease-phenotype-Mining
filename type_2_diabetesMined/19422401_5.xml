<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is now well established that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and it is likely that this association has a multifactorial aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a relative paucity of data on interventions to improve cognitive function in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two small randomized controlled trials have suggested that better glycaemic control, over a relatively short time period, can improve or prevent decline in cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is also increasing interest in the link between intracerebral insulin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested that relative and/or absolute deficiency of insulin may occur in Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and, although one small randomized trial was essentially negative, randomized trials are currently underway to investigate the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> on cognitive function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also activated in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and there are data linking increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the 11 beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35350">hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase type 1 enzyme, which generates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> from inactive <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> in many tissues including the brain, is an attractive therapeutic target to enhance cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large-scale epidemiological and intervention studies are now underway, which should enhance our understanding and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
