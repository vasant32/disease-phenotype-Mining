<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 5,888 adults aged &gt; or = 65 years were recruited and attended a baseline clinic visit in 1989-1990 (n = 5,201, original cohort) or 1992-1993 (n = 687 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>African-American [new] cohort) as participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FSG) was measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medication use was ascertained by drug inventory at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> annual clinic visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined at baseline as insulin or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> (OHA) use or as having an FSG &gt; or = 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl), the current consensus definition of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 387 (7%) original (FSG = 9.8 mmol/l [177 mg/dl]) and 115 (17%) new (FSG = 10.6 mmol/l [191 mg/dl]) cohort members had pharmacologically treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those in the original and in the new cohorts who survived follow-up, respectively, OHA use decreased from 80 to 48% (P &lt; 0.001) and from 67 to 50% (P &lt; 0.003) and insulin use increased from 20 to 33% (P = 0.001) and from 33 to 37% (P = 0.603) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 396 (8%) original (FSG = 8.8 mmol/l [159 mg/dl]) and 45 (7%) new (FSG = 10.0 mmol/l [181 mg/dl]) cohort members with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> untreated at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among them, respectively, OHA use reached 38 and 30% and insulin use reached 6 and 16% in 1996-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was common in this elderly cohort, and &gt; 80% of treated patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline were not achieving fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> goals of &lt; or = 6.7 mmol/l (120 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Many untreated at baseline remained untreated after 7 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
