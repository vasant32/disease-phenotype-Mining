<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We first verified that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> was able to restore the insulin secretory <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> competence of the GK beta-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, we demonstrated that in GK islets 1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> elicited a first-phase insulin release at low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, whereas it had no effect in Wistar; 2) total phospholipase C activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphate</z:chebi> production, and intracellular free calcium concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) elevation were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; 3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> triggered insulin release, even in the presence of thapsigargin, which induced a reduction of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i response (suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> produces amplification signals that augment the efficacy of elevated [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i on GK exocytosis); 4) inhibition of protein kinase C did not affect [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i nor the insulin release responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>; and 5) inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKAs), adenylyl cyclases, or cAMP generation, while not affecting the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i response, significantly lowered the insulinotropic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> (at low and high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> acts mainly through activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway to potently enhance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release in the GK beta-cell and, in doing so, normalizes its defective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness </plain></SENT>
