<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and microvascular disease in a cohort of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 11,140 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and at least one additional vascular risk factor were followed a median of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and the development of new or worsening microvascular disease, defined prospectively as a composite of renal and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level was 1.3 mmol/L (SD 0.45 mmol/L [range 0.1-4.0]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 32% of patients developed new or worsening microvascular disease, with 28% experiencing a renal event and 6% a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients in the highest third, those in the lowest third had a 17% higher risk of microvascular disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.17 [95% CI 1.06-1.28], P = 0.001) after adjustment for potential confounders and regression dilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was driven by a 19% higher risk of renal events (1.19 [1.08-1.32], P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between thirds of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> events (1.01 [0.82-1.25], P = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level is an independent risk factor for the development of microvascular disease affecting the kidney but not the retina </plain></SENT>
