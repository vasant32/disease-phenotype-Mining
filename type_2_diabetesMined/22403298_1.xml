<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypotheses that 1) cerebral but not peripheral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is increased in a spatial manner and 2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> orchestrates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stereology of brain, eye, and skeletal muscle microvasculature was evaluated in control and diabetic rats using three-dimensional images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Migration and tube formation properties of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were analyzed as markers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular density, volume, and surface area were progressively increased from rostral to caudal sections in both the cerebral cortex and striatum in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unperfused new vessels were more prominent and the pericyte-to-endothelial cell ratio was decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascularization was greater in the retina but lower in the peripheral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VEGF and nitrotyrosine levels were higher in cerebral microvessels of diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Migratory and tube formation properties were enhanced in BMECs from diabetic rats, which also expressed high levels of basal VEGF, nitrotyrosine, and membrane-type (MT1) matrix metalloprotease (MMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VEGF-neutralizing antibody and inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, src kinase, or MMP blocked the migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> increases and spatially regulates cerebral neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased VEGF-dependent angiogenic function in BMECs is mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and involves c-src and MT1-MMP activation </plain></SENT>
