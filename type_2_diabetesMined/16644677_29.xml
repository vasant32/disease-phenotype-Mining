<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of 2-(8-hydroxy-6-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-1-oxo-1H-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22727">benzopyran</z:chebi>-3-yl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30768">propionic acid</z:chebi> (NM-3), a small molecule isocoumarin with antiangiogenic activity, using diabetic db/db mice, a model of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increases in kidney weight, glomerular volume, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, urinary albumin excretion, total mesangial fraction, glomerular type IV collagen, glomerular endothelial area (CD31(+)), and monocyte/macrophage accumulation (F4/80(+)) observed in control db/db mice were significantly suppressed by daily intraperitoneal injection of NM-3 (100 mg/kg, for 8 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increases in renal expression of VEGF-A, Ang-2, fibrogenic factor transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha were also inhibited by NM-3 in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, decreases of nephrin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in db/db mice were recovered by NM-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment of db/db mice with NM-3 did not affect body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, or food consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NM-3 significantly suppressed the increase of VEGF induced by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in cultured podocytes and also suppressed the increase of VEGF and TGF-beta induced by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in cultured mesangial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential use of NM-3 as a novel therapeutic agent for renal alterations in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
