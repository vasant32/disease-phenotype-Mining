<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The TCF7L2 gene is located on chromosome 10q25 in a region of replicated linkage to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a microsatellite marker in intron 3 (DG10S478) and five correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in Icelandic individuals that showed strong association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which was replicated in Danish and European-American cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped four of the SNPs (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372) in Amish subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 137), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT; n = 139), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT; n = 342) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared genotype frequencies in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with those with NGT and found marginal association for rs7901695 (P = 0.05; odds ratio [OR] 1.51); comparison between NGT control subjects and the combined type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/IGT case group showed strong association with rs7901695 and rs7903146 (P = 0.008-0.01; OR 1.53-1.57) and marginal association with rs11196205 and rs12255372 (P = 0.07 and P = 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an expanded set of 698 Amish subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we found no association with insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels during a 3-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also genotyped these SNPs in nondiabetic, non-Amish subjects (n = 48), in whom intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were performed, and found an association between rs7901695 and rs7903146 and insulin sensitivity (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively) and disposition index (P = 0.04 and P = 0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide replicating evidence that variants in TCF7L2 increase the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and novel evidence that the variants likely influence both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
