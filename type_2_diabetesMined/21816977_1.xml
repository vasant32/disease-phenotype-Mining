<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is limited evidence on how intensive multifactorial treatment (IT) improves outcomes of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when initiated in the lead time between detection by screening and diagnosis in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of early detection and IT of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in primary care on the prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (DPN) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD) 6 years later in a pragmatic, cluster-randomized parallel group trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A stepwise screening program in 190 general practices in Denmark was used to identify 1,533 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General practices were randomized to deliver either IT or routine care (RC) as recommended through national guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were followed for 6 years and measures of DPN and PAD were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no statistically significant effect of IT on the prevalence of DPN and PAD compared with RC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of an ankle brachial index â‰¤0.9 was 9.1% (95% CI 6.0-12.2) in the RC arm and 7.3% (5.0-9.6) in the IT arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In participants tested for vibration detection threshold and light touch sensation, the prevalence of a least one abnormal test was 34.8% (26.7-43.0) in the RC arm and 30.1% (24.1-36.1) in the IT arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a population with screen-detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we did not find that screening followed by IT led to a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of DPN and PAD 6 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, treatment levels were high in both groups </plain></SENT>
