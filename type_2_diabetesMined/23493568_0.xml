<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2D) patients often exhibit hyperglucagonemia despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> suggesting defective α-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been suggested to underlie β-cell dysfunction in T2D, its role in α-cell biology remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and its deficiency in β-cells has been reported to impair insulin secretion leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of XBP1 in α-cells, we created complementary in vivo (α-cell specific XBP1 knockout (αXBPKO) mice) and in vitro (stable XBP1 knock down α-cell line, αXBPKD) models. αXBPKO mice exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and an inability to suppress glucagon secretion following <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation. αXBPKD cells exhibited activation of IRE1, an upstream activator of XBP1, leading to phosphorylation of JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, insulin treatment of αXBPKD cells reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (pY(896)), and phosphorylation of Akt, while enhancing serine phosphorylation (pS(307)) of IRS-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently the αXBPKD cells exhibited blunted suppression of glucagon secretion following insulin treatment in the presence of high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these data indicate that XBP1 deficiency in pancreatic α-cells induces altered insulin signaling and dysfunctional glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
