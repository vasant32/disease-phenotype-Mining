<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants took 6662 +/- 3077 steps per day, less than that reported in nondiabetic samples and more than that reported for samples living with more restrictive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>, joint replacement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006536'>obstructive lung disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Steps/day and BMI were inversely and significantly correlated (r=-0.27, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, there was a significant difference between BMI categories (from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> class III) with regard to steps/day (F=2.96, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference was most apparent between the highest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> classes (II and III) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This data is useful for sample comparison purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition the standard deviation or variance estimates can be used to calculate samples sizes for intervention efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Objective quantification of ambulatory activity via simple and inexpensive pedometers permits researchers and practitioners to easily screen for level of activity along a continuum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study opens the door for future research and clinical applications including identifying threshold values related to important health outcomes and evaluating incremental change due to various interventions in this population </plain></SENT>
