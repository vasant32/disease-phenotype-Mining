<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they come at considerable costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook a health economic analysis to better understand the value of adding two newer medications (exenatide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>) as second-line therapy to glycemic control strategies for patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis for the U.S. population aged 25-64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A lifetime analytic horizon and health care system perspective were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 3% annually, and costs are presented in 2008 U.S. dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared three glycemic control strategies: 1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> as a second-line agent, 2) exenatide as a second-line agent, and 3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> as a second-line agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included QALYs gained, incremental costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with each strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exenatide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> conferred 0.09 and 0.12 additional QALYs, respectively, relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> as second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In base case analysis, exenatide was dominated (cost more and provided fewer QALYs than the next most expensive option), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 169,572 dollars per QALY saved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results were sensitive to assumptions regarding medication costs, side effect duration, and side effect-associated disutilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> may confer substantial costs to health care systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Demonstrated gains in quality and/or quantity of life are necessary for these agents to provide economic value to patients and health care systems </plain></SENT>
