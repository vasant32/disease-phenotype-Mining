<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT) is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in recently diagnosed drug-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that allows for the evaluation of GAD positivity in the context of anthropometric and biochemical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 4,134 subjects enrolled in ADOPT for whom GAD status was obtained, 174 (4.2%) were GAD positive, with the prevalence of GAD antibodies being similar in North America (4.7%) and Europe (3.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although BMI and age were similar, GAD-positive patients had a lower fasting insulin level, compatible with them being more insulin sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lower fasting insulin concentration was accompanied by a decreased early insulin response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when this insulin response was corrected for the degree of insulin sensitivity, GAD-positive and -negative patients had similar beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the difference in insulin sensitivity, GAD-positive patients had higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the GAD-positive individuals, the prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> as defined by NCEP ATP III (National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III) was also lower (74.1 vs. 83.7%, P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These phenotypic differences may underlie a potential difference in the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and its clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
