<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Japanese patients with mild type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were allocated either 55% standard carbohydrate (sc) or 80% high carbohydrate diets for 1 week, and OGTT and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the diet was crossed over for another week, and OGTT and other identical parameters were re-evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High carbohydrate diet improved the area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration-time curve (AUG) in 16/24 patients, and significantly increased and decreased 1,5-anhydroglucitol and homeostasis model assessment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-R) as a whole, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) hc/sc ratio was inversely correlated with HOMA-R on a standard carbohydrate diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High carbohydrate diet significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, whereas it significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, hc/sc ratios of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters were inversely correlated with the respective parameters on standard carbohydrate diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that high carbohydrate diet <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> depending on patients and the improvement in FPG was predicted by HOMA-R on a standard carbohydrate diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of high carbohydrate diet on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles should be investigated through a long-term study in the future </plain></SENT>
