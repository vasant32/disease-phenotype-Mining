<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether improvements in glycemic control and body composition resulting from 6 months of supervised high-intensity progressive resistance training could be maintained after an additional 6 months of home-based resistance training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a 12-month randomized controlled trial in 36 sedentary, overweight men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 60-80 years) who were randomly assigned to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> plus high-intensity progressive resistance training (RT&amp;WL group) or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> plus a control program (WL group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Supervised gymnasium-based training for 6 months was followed by an additional 6 months of home-based training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control (HbA1c), body composition, muscle strength, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> abnormalities were assessed at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the WL group, HbA1c decreased significantly more in the RT&amp;WL group (-0.8%) during 6 months of supervised gymnasium-based training; however, this effect was not maintained after an additional 6 months of home-based training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the greater increase in lean body mass (LBM) observed in the RT&amp;WL group compared with the WL group (0.9 kg, P &lt; 0.05) after the gymnasium-based training tended to be maintained after the home-based training (0.8 kg, P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the gymnasium-based increases in upper body and lower body muscle strength in the RT&amp;WL group were maintained over the 12 months (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no between-group differences for changes in body weight, fat mass, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or insulin at 6 or 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, home-based progressive resistance training was effective for maintaining the gymnasium-based improvements in muscle strength and LBM but not glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reductions in adherence and exercise training volume and intensity seem to impede the effectiveness of home-based training for maintaining improved glycemic control </plain></SENT>
