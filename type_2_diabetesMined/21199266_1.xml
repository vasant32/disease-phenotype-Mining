<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: to examine patient beliefs, preferences and concerns regarding a once-weekly (QW) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: a total of 1516 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drawn from a national <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Illness Panel completed an anonymous online survey that assessed perceived attributes of QW therapy, willingness to take an injectable QW medication and patient characteristics that might influence their willingness, such as current perceived glycaemic control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> quality of life (DQOL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: positive attitudes regarding QW medication were common, with current injection users significantly more likely than non-injection users to view beneficial aspects: greater convenience, better medication adherence, improved quality of life (QOL) and a less overwhelming sense of treatment (in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 46.8% reported that they would likely take an injectable QW medication if recommended by their physician, with current injection users more than twice as likely as non-injection users (73.1 vs. 31.5%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Greater willingness to take QW medications was associated with poorer DQOL [injection users only; odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, p &lt; 0.01] and poorer perceived glycaemic control (non-injection users only; OR = 1.24, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concerns arose about consistency of dosage over time, potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>forgetfulness</z:hpo> and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: QW <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medications are viewed positively by patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially if they are current injection users or are dissatisfied with their current treatments or outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater convenience, better medication adherence and improved QOL are commonly endorsed attributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinicians may need to review both the positive attributes of QW medications as well as common patient concerns, when considering this option </plain></SENT>
