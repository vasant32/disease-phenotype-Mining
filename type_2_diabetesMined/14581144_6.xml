<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we compared the efficacy and safety profile of two different intensive insulin treatment strategies in patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> despite using a twice-daily insulin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 60 insulin-treated patients who had uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was a 6-month, open-label, randomised, parallel clinical trial conducted in two <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main end-points for analysis were weekly self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> readings, HbA1c levels, total daily insulin dose, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The breakfast 2-h, lunch 2-h and dinner 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values and pre-dinner <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were significantly lower in the Lispro group than the regular insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HbA1c value at the end of the study was significantly lower in the Lispro group (7.3 +/- 0.7%) compared with the regular insulin group (7.7 +/- 0.7%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean insulin doses were similar in the treatment groups initially and at the end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant increase in insulin dose in both groups from baseline to the end of the study (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> rates were comparably low and similar in both groups during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that mealtime insulin Lispro plus additional lunch and bedtime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin is superior to premeal regular insulin plus bedtime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin for overall glycaemic regulation with similar <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and comparable rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
