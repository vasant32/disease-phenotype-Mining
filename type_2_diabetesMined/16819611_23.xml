<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We evaluated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (by OGTT), insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp and the OGTT index OGIS) and beta cell function (OGTT modelling analysis) in 32 morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI=52+/-7 kg/m(2), mean+/-SD) patients (12 with NGT, 9 with IGT and 11 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), before and after BPD, and in 22 lean control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied before and from 7 days to 60 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BPD <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, who after surgery <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects (pre-BPD 341+/-79 ml min(-1) m(-2), post-BPD 511+/-57 ml min(-1) m(-2), lean 478+/-49 ml min(-1) m(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The insulin sensitivity change was detectable within 10 days of BPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, beta cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was impaired in diabetic subjects (25 [18] pmol min(-1) m(-2) l mmol(-1), median [interquartile range]) compared with lean subjects (82 [98]; p&lt;/=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After BPD, beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity showed a tendency towards improvement but remained impaired in diabetic subjects (30 [62]; p&lt;0.01 vs lean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total insulin output decreased in parallel with the insulin sensitivity increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the whole patient group, mean OGTT <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were inversely related to both insulin sensitivity and beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity (r (2)=0.67, partial r=-0.76 and -0.41, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NEFAs, leptin and adiponectin were related to insulin sensitivity but could not explain the early improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Following BPD, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was restored mainly as a result of a rapid and large improvement in insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
