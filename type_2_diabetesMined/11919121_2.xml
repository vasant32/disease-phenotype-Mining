<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 36 Japanese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (50.8 +/- 8.6 years of age, BMI 24.5 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2)) and 273 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated for 3 months with diet alone (30 kcal/kg per day) (n = 15), diet with voglibose (n = 12), or diet with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They underwent 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing, assessment of insulin sensitivity (SI), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) with intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing based on the minimal model, and measurement of abdominal visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue area (SAT) by computed tomography before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diabetic patients had comparable SAT but larger VAT than the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 2-3 kg, VAT and SAT were decreased similarly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The VAT-to-SAT ratio was decreased only in the voglibose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in glycemic control after diet were closely correlated with changes in VAT but not with changes in SAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SI and AIR were unchanged in the diet group but were improved in the voglibose and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were relatively lean but had excess VAT, diet with or without voglibose or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> effectively reduced VAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decrease in VAT was closely associated with improvement of glycemic control with diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional use of voglibose or low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> had no detrimental effects on abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and had beneficial effects on SI and AIR </plain></SENT>
