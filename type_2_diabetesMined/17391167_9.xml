<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an open-label prospective study of 6-month duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomization was performed to insulin monotherapy, insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 30 mg daily, or insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> up to 2000 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven subjects with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal was to achieve a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) (&lt;5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight, resting energy expenditure (REE), reported energy intake and total energy expenditure, HbA1c, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glycosuria</z:hpo>, plasma leptin, ghrelin and adiponectin levels, and body fat were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 49 subjects completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, weight was 89.4 +/- 22.9 kg and HbA1c was 11.1 +/- 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weight increased by 7.46, 7.60 and 7.12 kg in the monotherapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> groups, respectively [p = 0.98 between and &lt;0.0001 within the groups by repeated measures-analysis of variance (RM-anova)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA1c dropped to 7.8 +/- 0.9% in the monotherapy arm, 7.6 +/- 1.0% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> arm and 7.2 +/- 1.2% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reported energy intake decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>Glycosuria</z:hpo> decreased but was not correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, while HbA1c changes were correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>REE per lean mass decreased (p = 0.04 by RM-anova) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The subcutaneous fat areas in the insulin monotherapy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> arms showed increases (p = 0.02 and 0.004 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> was probably not due to an increase in food intake, while REE per lean body mass decreased, suggesting a role for increased efficiency in fuel usage due to improved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A drop in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glycosuria</z:hpo> probably also contributed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the monotherapy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> arms, the subcutaneous fat areas increased </plain></SENT>
