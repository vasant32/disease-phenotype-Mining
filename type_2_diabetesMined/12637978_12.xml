<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequently used conventional immunoreactive assays for insulin cross-react with proinsulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In short-term studies (&lt;5 years), proinsulin predicts the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied, with a 27-year follow-up, the longitudinal relationships between intact proinsulin, 32-33 split proinsulin, specific and immunoreactive insulin (IRI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) after an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load and the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population-based cohort of 50-year-old men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in plasma samples, stored since 1970-73 using specific two-site immunometric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IRI was measured at baseline using radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations between development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and predictor variables, were analysed with logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results are shown as odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a one standard deviation increase in a predictor variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 33% over 27 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intact proinsulin (OR, 1.57, CI, 1.16-2.14), and 32-33 split proinsulin (OR, 1.70, CI, 1.20-2.39) were associated with development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of AIR, adjusted for BMI and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, whereas specific insulin was not (OR, 1.31, CI, 0.98-1.77), nor was IRI (OR, 1.25, CI, 0.96-1.63) </plain></SENT>
