<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blockade of RAGE using a soluble form of the receptor (sRAGE) suppressed vascular hyperpermeability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since little is known about the regulation of endogenous sRAGE levels, we determined whether serum sRAGE is influenced by circulating AGEs and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 150 healthy control and 318 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects were subdivided into those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or normoalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum sRAGE was assayed by ELISA and serum AGEs by competitive ELISA using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against AGE-RNase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic subjects had higher sRAGE (1,029.5 pg/ml [766.1-1,423.0] interquartile range vs 1,002.6 [726.5-1,345.3], p&lt;0.05) and AGEs (4.07+/-1.13, SD, unit/ml vs 3.39+/-1.05, p&lt;0.01) than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proteinuric subjects had the highest sRAGE levels and there was a significant trend between the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and sRAGE (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In diabetic subjects, serum log(sRAGE) correlated with AGEs (r=0.27, p&lt;0.001), log(plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) (r=0.31, p&lt;0.001), log(urine AER) (r=0.24, p&lt;0.01) and log(<z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>) (r=0.15, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On stepwise linear regression analysis, AGEs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were the main independent determinants of sRAGE concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Serum sRAGE levels and circulating AGEs are associated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are required to determine whether endogenous sRAGE potentially influences the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic vascular complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
