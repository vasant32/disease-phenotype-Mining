<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> meets many but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the criteria for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concerns about potential harms of screening have largely been resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening identifies a high-risk population with the potential to gain from widely available interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in spite of the findings of modelling studies, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness remains uncertain, in contrast to other screening programmes (such as for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>) that are yet to be fully implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is also uncertainty about optimal specifications and implementation of a screening programme, and further work to complete concerning development and delivery of individual- and population-level preventive strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While there is growing evidence of the net benefit of earlier detection of individuals with prevalent but undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there remains limited justification for a policy of universal population-based screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the present time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data from ongoing studies should inform the key assumptions in existing modelling studies and further reduce uncertainty </plain></SENT>
