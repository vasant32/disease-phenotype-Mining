<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> during a 24-week treatment in drug-na√Øve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study of 24-week treatment with vildagliptin (100 mg daily, given as equally divided doses; n = 519) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (8 mg daily, given as a once-daily dose; n = 267) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Monotherapy with vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> decreased A1C (baseline = 8.7%) to a similar extent during the 24-week treatment, with most of the A1C reduction achieved by weeks 12 and 16, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At end point, vildagliptin was as effective as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, improving A1C by -1.1 +/- 0.1% (P &lt; 0.001) and -1.3 +/- 0.1% (P &lt; 0.001), respectively, meeting the statistical criterion for noninferiority (upper-limit 95% CI for between-treatment difference &lt; or =0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased more with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (-2.3 mmol/l) than with vildagliptin (-1.3 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body weight did not change in vildagliptin-treated patients (-0.3 +/- 0.2 kg) but increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated patients (+1.6 +/- 0.3 kg, P &lt; 0.001 vs. vildagliptin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, vildagliptin significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, non-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (-9 to -16%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; or = 0.01) but produced a smaller increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (+4 vs. +9%, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event was 61.4 vs. 64.0% in patients receiving vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycemic episode</z:e> was experienced by one patient in each treatment group, while the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was greater with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (4.1%) than vildagliptin (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, demonstrating similar glycemic reductions as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> but without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
