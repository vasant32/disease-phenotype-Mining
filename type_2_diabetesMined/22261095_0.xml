<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline demographic, health- and treatment-related measures were evaluated as predictors of one year glycaemic control defined separately as HbA(1c)≤ 7.5% and a continuous measure of HbA(1c) concentration, using multivariate regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors were adjusted for objectively assessed medication adherence and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-year HbA(1c) concentration was associated with baseline HbA(1c) (p&lt;0.001), BMI (p=0.02), and inversely associated with age (p=0.007) and objectively assessed adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adherent patients had one-year (adjusted) HbA(1c) concentration 0.65% (95% CI -1.04, -0.25; p=0.001) lower than nonadherent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (95% CI) of HbA(1c)≤ 7.5% for 10-year higher age were 1.63 (1.08, 2.45); for adherent compared to non-adherent patients 1.89 (0.84, 4.25); for patients receiving &gt;5 compared to ≤ 5 medications 0.32 (0.13, 0.76); and for each 1% increment in baseline HbA(1c) 0.48 (0.31, 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The lower HbA(1c) achieved from greater adherence to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering treatment is comparable to that achieved with additional medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relationships between older age and better glycaemic control are not explained by better adherence, but may partly relate to lower BMI </plain></SENT>
