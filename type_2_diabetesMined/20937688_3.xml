<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asymptomatic bacteriuria</z:e> (ASB) is more common in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than among control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, we wanted to clarify the clinical significance of ASB in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data since 1966 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ASB was present in 439 of 3,579 (12.2%) patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 121 of 2,702 (4.5%) healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ASB was more common both in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI 1.1-8.0]) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (3.2 [2.0-5.2]) than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The point prevalence of ASB was higher in both women (14.2 vs. 5.1%; 2.6 [1.6-4.1]) and men (2.3 vs. 0.8%; 3.7 [1.3-10.2]) as well as in children and adolescents (12.9 vs. 2.7%; 5.4 [2.7-11.0]) with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> was more common in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ASB than those without ASB (2.9 [1.7-4.8]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> was associated with ASB (1.6 [1.1-2.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We were able to show that the prevalence of ASB is higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also found that diabetic subjects with ASB more often had <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
