<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous neuroimaging studies have mainly used semiquantitative rating scales to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and white matter lesions (WMLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we used an automated segmentation technique to investigate the association of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, several <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related risk factors and cognition with cerebral tissue and WML volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance images of 99 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 46 control participants from a population-based sample were segmented using a k-nearest neighbour classifier trained on ten manually segmented data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>White matter, grey matter, lateral ventricles, cerebrospinal fluid not including lateral ventricles, and WML volumes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, level of education and intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with a smaller volume of grey matter (-21.8 ml; 95% CI -34.2, -9.4) and with larger lateral ventricle volume (7.1 ml; 95% CI 2.3, 12.0) and with larger white matter lesion volume (56.5%; 95% CI 4.0, 135.8), whereas white matter volume was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In separate analyses for men and women, the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were only significant in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The combination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with larger WML volume indicates that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with mixed pathology in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed sex differences were unexpected and need to be addressed in further studies </plain></SENT>
