<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of glycemia and 43 genetic risk variants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with amino acid levels in the population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Syndrome</z:e> in Men (METSIM) Study, including 9,369 nondiabetic or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic Finnish men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of eight amino acids were measured with proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increasing fasting and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were associated with increasing levels of several amino acids and decreasing levels of histidine and glutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alanine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, and glutamine predicted incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a 4.7-year follow-up of the METSIM Study, and their effects were largely mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (except for glutamine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found significant correlations between insulin sensitivity (Matsuda insulin sensitivity index) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of genes regulating amino acid degradation in 200 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of 43 risk single nucleotide polymorphisms for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-increasing major C allele of rs780094 of GCKR, was significantly associated with decreased levels of alanine and isoleucine and elevated levels of glutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the levels of branched-chain, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33856">aromatic amino acids</z:chebi> and alanine increased and the levels of glutamine and histidine decreased with increasing glycemia, reflecting, at least in part, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one single nucleotide polymorphism regulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was significantly associated with amino acid levels </plain></SENT>
