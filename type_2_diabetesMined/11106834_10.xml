<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reactions were used to detect insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms of the ACE gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the frequency of II, ID, or DD genotypes, or of I and D alleles among subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NDR) or with simple diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (SDR) and non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also no difference in the frequency of ACE genotypes among subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with NDR, or SDR and ADR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of the ACE DD genotype in ADR was significantly higher than that in controls (chi(2)=6.64, P=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the frequency of the D allele in ADR was significantly higher than that in controls (chi(2)=6.33, P=0.012), NDR (chi(2)=4.18, P=0.041) and SDR (chi(2)=4 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a significant relationship between the presence of the D allele polymorphism in the ACE gene and ADR in Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
