<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the 10-year mortality and effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration on overall and cause-specific mortality in diabetic subjects in the Verona <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (VDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Records from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics, family physicians, and a drug consumption database were used to identify 5,818 subjects &gt; or =45 years of age with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were alive and residing in Verona, Italy on 31 December 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vital status of each subject was ascertained on 31 December 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Underlying causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were determined from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> rates and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate ratios (DRRs) were computed and standardized to the population of Verona in 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study, 2,328 subjects died; 974 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, 517 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, 324 to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related diseases, 134 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">digestive diseases</z:e>, 250 to other natural causes, and 48 to external causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 81 subjects who died of unknown causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> rates from natural causes were higher in men than in women (DRR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) and rose in both sexes with increasing duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the natural causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, those for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related diseases were strongly related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (P = 0.001). a modest relationship with duration was also found for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> in men (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular disease</z:e> was the principal cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the VDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rates for natural causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rose with increasing duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related diseases in both sexes and from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> in men were largely responsible for this increase </plain></SENT>
