<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the genetic variations of the VEGF gene to assess its possible relation to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among seven common polymorphisms in the promoter region, 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and 3'UTR of the VEGF gene, genotype distribution of the C(-634)G polymorphism differed significantly (P = 0.011) between patients with (n = 150) and without (n = 118) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and the C allele was significantly increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> compared with those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.0037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) for the CC genotype of C(-634)G to the GG genotype was 3.20 (95% CI 1.45-7.05, P = 0.0046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The -634C allele was significantly increased in patients with nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) (P = 0.0026) and was insignificantly increased in patients with proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) (P = 0.081) compared with patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, although frequencies of the allele did not differ significantly between the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that the C(-634)G polymorphism was strongly associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.0018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, VEGF serum levels were significantly higher in healthy subjects with the CC genotype of the C(-634)G polymorphism than in those with the other genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the C(-634)G polymorphism in the 5'UTR of the VEGF gene is a novel genetic risk factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
