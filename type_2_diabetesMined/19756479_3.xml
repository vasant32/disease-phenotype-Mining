<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic Medline search was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using data from the selected studies, contact frequency was plotted against HbA(1c) reduction and endpoint insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of face-to-face vs telephone contact was also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin dose was plotted against HbA(1c) reduction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> rate and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate non-specific study effects, the relationship between contact frequency and HbA(1c) was also assessed in dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The reduction in HbA(1c) was highly correlated with contact frequency and endpoint insulin dose (r (2) = 0.751, p &lt; 0.001 and r (2) = 0.433, p = 0.008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, after adjusting for contact frequency, the relationship between insulin dose and HbA(1c) reduction was no longer significant (p = 0.270) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of both clinical and telephone contacts were independent predictors of HbA(1c) improvement (p = 0.010 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no dose-response relationship between end-of-study insulin dose and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In DPP-4 inhibitor studies, contact frequency was not positively associated with HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The frequency of contact with the study team is highly correlated with the improvement in HbA(1c) achieved in basal insulin initiation trials in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This has important implications for trial design and interpretation, as well as for clinical care </plain></SENT>
