<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In intense exercise (&gt;80% VO(2max)), unlike at lesser intensities, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is the exclusive muscle fuel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It must be mobilized from muscle and liver <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> in both the fed and fasted states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (GP) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (GU) have to be different from exercise at &lt;60% VO(2max), in which it is established that the portal glucagon-to-insulin ratio causes the less than or equal to twofold increase in GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GU is subject to complex regulation by insulin, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, alternate substrates, other humoral factors, and muscle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At lower intensities, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is constant during postabsorptive exercise and declines during postprandial exercise (and often in persons with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During such exercise, insulin secretion is inhibited by beta-cell alpha-adrenergic receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in intense exercise, GP rises seven- to eightfold and GU rises three- to fourfold; therefore, glycemia increases and plasma insulin decreases minimally, if at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, even an increase in insulin during alpha-blockade or during a pancreatic clamp does not prevent this response, nor does pre-exercise <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> due to a prior meal or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At exhaustion, GU initially decreases more than GP, which leads to greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, requiring a substantial rise in insulin for 40--60 min to restore pre-exercise levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Absence of this response in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> leads to sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and mimicking it by intravenous infusion restores the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compelling evidence supports the conclusion that the marked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> responses to intense exercise are responsible for both the GP increment (that occurs even during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion and postprandially) and the restrained increase of GU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These responses are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in persons with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who often report exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and in whom the clinical challenge is to reproduce the recovery period <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intense exercise in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> requires additional study </plain></SENT>
