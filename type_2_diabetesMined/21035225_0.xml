<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary aims: fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels; estimation of the elapsed time between HbA(1c) exceeding 7% and TI; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> combinations used, % patients with good cardiometabolic control (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c&lt;100mg/dL; SBP&lt;130 and DPB&lt;80mmHg and HbA(1c)&lt;7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: one-cohort, multicenter, retrospective, observational study conducted in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed with T2DM that had switched from monotherapy to combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy were evaluated at baseline and after one year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: a total of 1202 T2DM patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of TI: mean HbA(1c) 8.1%; median time of uncontrolled disease: 2.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After one-year of TI: significant reduction in mean HbA(1c) (8.1% vs.7.0%, p&lt;0.001) and a mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels reduction (181.1mg/dL vs.144.1mg/dL, p&lt;0.001) was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients under glycemic control (HbA(1c)&lt;7%) increased from 12.2% to 51.6% (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most common <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> combinations: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (44.1%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>+thiazolidindione (15.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: in the population of T2DM patients analyzed, TI was carried out when HbA(1c) values were above those recommended in clinical guidelines (â‰¤ 7%), with a delay of two years to address the second step of therapy, despite the consensus recommendation of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>/EASD of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TI was shown to be effective since addition of a second <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug led to an average reduction of HbA(1c) of approximately 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was the drug most commonly used as monotherapy being the most frequent combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
