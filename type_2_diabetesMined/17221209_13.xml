<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These variants have previously been examined for association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with inconclusive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated both of these variants in 7,808 unrelated, middle-aged white people for their association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in a case-control study, quantitative trait analysis and meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both variants were investigated for their potential influence on measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by case-control and quantitative trait analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The present study did not find consistent evidence for an association of these beta2-adrenergic receptor variants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; neither did the quantitative trait analyses show any effect of the variants on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, both the Gly allele of the Arg16Gly variant and the Glu allele of the Gln27Glu variant showed nominal association with systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a nominal association of the Arg16 allele frequency and genotype distribution with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, no influence on quantitative biochemical phenotypes related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A nominal association of the Arg/Gly genotype with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was also observed (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses provided no evidence of a synergistic or an additive effect of these variants on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: After studying 7,808 middle-aged white subjects, we were unable to demonstrate any consistent associations between two common amino acid polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenergic receptor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
