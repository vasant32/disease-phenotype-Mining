<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 10 full-blood Australian Aborigines <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and who were from an urbanised community with a high prevalence of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were compared to 10 age- and body-mass-index-matched Caucasian controls with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> kinetics were measured basally and following an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was equal in the two groups, but 2 h following the 75 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, the Aboriginal subjects had higher glycaemia than the controls (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulinaemia was higher in the Aborigines both basally and following the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> drink (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>, hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was higher in the Aboriginal subjects (P less than 0.01), while metabolic clearance rate was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in young Australian Aborigines with a strong family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, both hepatic and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are early abnormalities </plain></SENT>
