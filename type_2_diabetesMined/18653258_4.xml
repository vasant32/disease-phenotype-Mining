<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test the hypothesis that the Ala16Val variant could be associated with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 523 nondiabetic Japanese-Americans who underwent a 75g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and were followed for an average of 9.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard analysis, stratified by category of OGTT, was used to determine whether the Ala16Val polymorphism was a risk factor in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 65 subjects developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with Ala allele carriers, subjects with a Val homozygote showed significantly higher risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (stratified hazard ratio=2.05 [95% confidence interval 1.03-4.08]; P=0.041) after adjustment for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, body mass index, and homeostasis model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the MnSOD Ala16Val polymorphism might be associated with development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Japanese-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that insufficient ROS scavenging might be associated with a susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
