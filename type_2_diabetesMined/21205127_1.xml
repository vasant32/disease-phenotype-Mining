<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether the differential effects of these therapies on body weight differed with respect to their effect on bone mineral density (BMD) and markers of calcium homeostasis in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients with T2D were randomized to exenatide twice daily (n = 36) or insulin glargine once daily (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total body BMD, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and serum markers of calcium homeostasis were assessed before and after 44-week treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exenatide or insulin glargine treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased body weight</z:hpo> by 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoint BMD was similar in both groups after 44-week therapy (LSmean ± s.e.m </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium and phosphate remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-four-week treatment with exenatide or insulin glargine had no adverse effects on bone density in patients with T2D, despite differential effects on body weight </plain></SENT>
