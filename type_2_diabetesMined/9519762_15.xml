<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">Forskolin</z:chebi> restores the impaired insulin release in both the isolated perfused pancreas and isolated islets from these rats (Abdel-Halim et al., <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> 45:934-940, 1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that the insulinotropic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> in the GK rat is due to increased generation of cAMP and that it is associated with overexpression of adenylyl cyclase (AC)-III <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AC-III <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression was demonstrated by in situ hybridization using oligonucleotide probes binding to different regions of the rat AC-III <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was associated with the presence of two point mutations identified at positions -28 bp (A --&gt; G) and -358 bp (A --&gt; C) of the promoter region of the AC-III gene and was demonstrable in both GK rat islets and peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection of COS cells with a luciferase reporter gene system revealed up to 25-fold increased promoter activity of GK AC-III promoter when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat promoter (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> restores the impaired insulin release in islets of the GK rat through enhanced cAMP generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is linked to overexpression of AC-III <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in GK islets due to two functional point mutations in the promoter region of the AC-III gene </plain></SENT>
