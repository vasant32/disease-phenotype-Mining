<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to identify the prevalence and the determinants of subclinical diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A group of 219 unselected patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> underwent resting and stress echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, the remaining 120 patients (age 57+/-10 years, 73 male) were studied with tissue Doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic strain of each wall and systolic (Sm) and diastolic (Em) velocity of each basal segment were measured from the three apical views and averaged for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant subclinical LV dysfunction was identified according to Sm and Em <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges adjusted by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strain and Em were correlated with clinical, therapeutic, echocardiographic and biochemical variables, and significant independent associations were sought using a multiple linear regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant subclinical LV dysfunction was present in 27% diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myocardial systolic dysfunction by peak strain was independently associated with glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level (p&lt;0.001) and lack of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> treatment (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Myocardial diastolic function (Em) was independently predicted by age (p=0.013), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p=0.001), insulin (p=0.008) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (p=0.01) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, subclinical LV dysfunction is common and associated with poor diabetic control, advancing age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment; <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> and insulin therapies appear to be protective </plain></SENT>
