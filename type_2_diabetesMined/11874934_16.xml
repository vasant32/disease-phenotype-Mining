<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) affects medical care costs differently in subjects with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and explored the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> on costs across the dimensions of age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and medical care costs for subjects with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16,180 full-year health maintenance organization members in 1999 who had been diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in control members matched by year of birth and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We ascertained diagnoses from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region's electronic ambulatory medical record and from hospital discharge datafiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Utilization from these and other data systems were multiplied by unit costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was 76% more prevalent in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the risk ratios of more severe forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were even greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk ratios for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were greatest in younger subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cost profiles for subjects with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> differed markedly from those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the latter group, costs grew steadily with age, whereas in the former group, costs peaked in the 55- to 64-year age group before declining with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> present in diabetic patients are more likely to be more severe and therefore more costly than in similar subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> also disproportionately affects younger diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> is present in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, more costs occur earlier in life as well as earlier in the course of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
