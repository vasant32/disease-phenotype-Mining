<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Myotubes obtained from six healthy men (54 ± 3 years (mean ± SE), BMI 25.0 ± 1.7 kg/m(2), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (fP-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) 5.47 ± 0.09 mmol/l) were treated for 4 h with 100 μmol/l RSV and/or 0.2 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, and stimulated with or without 100 nmol/l insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assays of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> oxidation, intracellular signalling and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RSV did not reverse <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-induced impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, RSV decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis in human skeletal muscle cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was increased in response to RSV, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and increased expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) </plain></SENT>
