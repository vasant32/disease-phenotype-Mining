<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) of the toll-like receptor 4 have an association with late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 246 type 1 and 530 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The alleles of both polymorphisms were detected using PCR and subsequent cleavage by NcoI and HinfI restriction endonucleases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference was found between type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients in the prevalence of alleles of the Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the alleles Gly299 and Ile399 occurred in a co-segregatory manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the Gly299/Ile399 haplotype was 10.6 and 12.1% in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, respectively (P = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> was found in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic patients, however, heterozygote carriers of the Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile genotypes had a significantly reduced prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> (odds ratio 0.35 [95% CI 0.19-0.61]; P = 0.0002); no association with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile genotypes of the TLR4 gene are associated with reduced prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> in type 2, but not in type 1, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus different mechanisms may be involved in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
