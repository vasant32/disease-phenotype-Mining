<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decreased beta cell neogenesis could contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The longevity and turnover of human beta cells is unknown; in rodents &lt;1 year old, a half-life of 30 days is estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular lipofuscin body (LB) accumulation is a hallmark of ageing in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To estimate the lifespan of human beta cells, we measured beta cell LB accumulation in individuals aged 1-81 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LB content was determined by electron microscopical morphometry in sections of beta cells from human (non-diabetic, n = 45; type 2 diabetic, n = 10) and non-human primates (n = 10; 5-30 years) and from 15 mice aged 10-99 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total cellular LB content was estimated by three-dimensional (3D) mathematical modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LB area proportion was significantly correlated with age in human and non-human primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of human LB-positive beta cells was significantly related to age, with no apparent differences in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LB content was low in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinomas</z:e> (n = 5) and alpha cells and in mouse beta cells (LB content in mouse &lt;10% human) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using 3D electron microscopy and 3D mathematical modelling, the LB-positive human beta cells (representing aged cells) increased from &gt;or=90% (&lt;10 years) to &gt;or=97% (&gt;20 years) and remained constant thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Human beta cells, unlike those of young rodents, are long-lived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LB proportions in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> suggest that little adaptive change occurs in the adult human beta cell population, which is largely established by age 20 years </plain></SENT>
