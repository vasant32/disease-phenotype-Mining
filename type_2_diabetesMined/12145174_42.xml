<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPAR-gamma2 gene with the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was investigated in 522 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) participating in the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized to either an intensive diet and exercise group or a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By 3 years of intervention, the odds ratio of the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for subjects with the Ala12 allele was 2.11-fold compared with that for subjects with the Pro12Pro genotype (95% CI 1.20-3.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased also in subjects who gained weight or belonged to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the intervention group, subjects with the Ala12Ala genotype lost more weight during the follow-up than subjects with other genotypes (Pro12Pro vs. Ala12Ala P = 0.043), and none of subjects with the Ala12Ala genotype developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the Ala12 allele may predispose to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, beneficial changes in diet, increases in physical activity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> may reverse, to some extent, the diabetogenic impact of the Ala12 allele, possibly due to an improved insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
