<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> carried out home-based bicycle training for 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to one of two training programmes at 60% of maximal oxygen uptake: three 10 min sessions per day (3 x 10) or one 30 min session per day (1 x 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were measured during a 3 h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity index (ISI(composite)), pre-hepatic insulin secretion rates (ISR) and change in insulin secretion per unit change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (B(total)) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness increased in response to training in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 3 x 10 (n = 9) fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 0.01), 120 min <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> OGTT (p = 0.04) and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration areas under the curve at 120 min (p &lt; 0.04) and 180 min (p = 0.07) decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These parameters remained unchanged in group 1 x 30 (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were found in ISI(composite), ISR and B(total) in either of the exercise groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a matched time-control group (n = 10), glycaemic control did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Moderate to high-intensity training performed at 3 x 10 min/day is preferable to 1 x 30 min/day with regard to effects on glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is in spite of the fact that cardiorespiratory fitness increased similarly in both exercise groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation is that the energy expenditure associated with multiple short daily sessions may be greater than that in a single daily session </plain></SENT>
