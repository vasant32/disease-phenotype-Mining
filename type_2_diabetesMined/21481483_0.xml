<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of Ishige okamurae extract on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in C57BL/-KsJ-db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We administered a standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIN</z:e>-93G diet with or without IOE to the animals for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 6 weeks, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was improved and blood glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were lowered in sample group mice as compared to those in the diabetic control group mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>Hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> was reduced in the I. okamurae extract group mice with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With regard to hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic enzyme activities, glucokinase activity was enhanced in the IOE group mice, while <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase activities in the IOE group mice were significantly lowered than those in the diabetic control group mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content was elevated in the IOE group as compared to that in the diabetic control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The homeostatic index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was lower in the I. okamurae extract group mice than in the diabetic control group mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> of I. okamurae extract lowers the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level by altering the hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic enzyme activities and improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
