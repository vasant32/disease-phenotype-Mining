<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> disease, in which the gradual deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance is associated with the progressive decrease in beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> per se has deleterious effects on both beta-cell function and insulin action, which are partially reversible by the short-term control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the induction of euglycemia, using intensive insulin therapy at the time of clinical diagnosis, could lead to a significant improvement in insulin secretion and action and thus alter the clinical course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirteen newly diagnosed diet-unresponsive type 2 diabetic patients were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for 2 weeks and followed longitudinally while being treated with diet alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients were considered therapeutic failures since CSII failed to induce euglycemia (n = 1) or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control deteriorated within 6 months after CSII (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining nine patients were maintained on diet alone with adequate control from 9 to &gt; 50 months (median +/- SE, 26 +/- 4.8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five patients, glycemic control deteriorated after 9-36 months, but a repeat 2-week CSII treatment reestablished control in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these patients underwent a third CSII treatment 13 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time this article was written, six patients of the initial group were still controlled without medication 16-59 months (median +/- SE, 45.5 +/- 6.6 months) after the initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body weight remained unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in a significant proportion of type 2 diabetic patients who fail to respond to dietary measures, short-term intensive insulin treatment can effectively establish responsiveness, allowing long-term glycemic control without medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to establish whether simpler treatment regimens could be equally effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If the hypothesis offered here finds support, present approaches to the management of newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may need to be revised </plain></SENT>
