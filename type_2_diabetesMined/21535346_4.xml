<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compare two strategies: initial combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as a fixed-dose combination (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) and initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, with the option to add additional antihyperglycaemic agents (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHAs</z:chebi>) in either treatment arm during the second phase of the study in order to reach adequate glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy over 44 weeks in 1250 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in a two-part, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial 18-week portion (Phase A) of this study in which additional <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHAs</z:chebi> were only allowed based on prespecified glycaemic criteria, has been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we present results from the 26-week Phase B portion of the study during which double-blind study medication continued; however, unlike Phase A, during Phase B investigators were unmasked to results for <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1C (HbA1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and directed to manage glycaemic control by adding incremental <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>(s) as deemed clinically appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1250 patients randomized in the study with 965 completing Phase A and continuing in Phase B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, 8.8% and 16.7% received additional <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> therapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although glycaemic therapy in both groups was to have been managed to optimize HbA1c reductions with the option for investigators to supplement with additional <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHAs</z:chebi> during Phase B, patients randomized to initial therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> had larger reductions of HbA1c from baseline compared with patients randomized to initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy [least squares (LS) mean change: -2.3% and -1.8% (p &lt; 0.001 for difference) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy groups, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significantly larger reduction in FPG from baseline was observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> group compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy group (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> group had an HbA1c of less than 7.0% or less than 6.5% compared with those on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both treatment strategies were generally well tolerated, with a low and similar incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in both groups and lower incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and diarrhoea in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> group compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A strategy initially implementing combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> was superior to a strategy initially implementing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, even when accounting for the later addition of supplemental <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
