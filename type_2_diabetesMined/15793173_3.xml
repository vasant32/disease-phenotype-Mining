<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We previously reported 6-month results of a controlled study of an intervention that improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> for rural patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We subsequently provided the identical intervention to the control region after the main study was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was 10% improvement in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, or HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the previously reported 6-month effect of the original intervention with the effect of the crossed-over intervention to the former control region and remeasured outcomes in the original intervention region 12 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our analysis included 200 original intervention and 181 crossed-over intervention subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age of the population was 62.4 +/- 12.4 years (mean +/- SD), and 54.3% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar proportion of patients in the crossed-over intervention group achieved improvement in the primary composite outcome compared with the original intervention group (38 vs. 44%, respectively; P = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analyses, we observed less improvement in blood pressure (adjusted odds ratio 0.40 [95% CI 0.17-0.75]) but greater improvements in total cholesterol (1.86 [0.93-3.7]) with the crossed-over intervention compared with the original intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed sustained improvements in total cholesterol and HbA(1c) levels in the original intervention group, whereas previous large gains in control of blood pressure diminished over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that our intervention was generalizable across settings, and its effect persisted over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, without ongoing intervention or reinforcement, we noted some loss of the original benefits that had accrued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future translational work should incorporate interventions such as ours into ongoing systems of rural care </plain></SENT>
