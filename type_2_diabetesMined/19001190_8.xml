<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Subjects with the diagnosis of latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA) are more prone to need insulin treatment than those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with LADA develop the need for insulin treatment, indicating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> by comparing phenotypes of LADA with and without perceived need for insulin treatment (data obtained at times when diagnosis of LADA was not investigated) and also compared LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> population-based Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã¸ndelag Health study (n = 64,931), performed in 1995-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were assembled for individuals with LADA (n = 106) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 943) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the comparison of individuals with LADA both with and without the need for insulin, insulin-treated subjects had higher titers of GAD antibodies (P &lt; 0.001) and lower fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GAD antibodies and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> correlated negatively (r = -0.40; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the comparison of individuals with LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> without the need for insulin, markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were equally prevalent and pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were also similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the comparison of insulin-treated individuals with LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, more patients with LADA received insulin (40 vs. 22%, P &lt; 0.001) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were lower (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with LADA were leaner but were still overweight (mean BMI 28.7 vs. 30.9 kg/m2 in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the comparison of type 2 diabetic patients with and without insulin, insulin-treated subjects were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had higher A1C and lower C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions are that 1) the need for insulin treatment in LADA is linked to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and beta-cell failure, 2) subjects with LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without the need for insulin treatment are phenotypically similar, and 3) insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients is associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta-cell insufficiency </plain></SENT>
