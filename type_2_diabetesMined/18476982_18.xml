<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this exploratory analysis was to assess the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, on pancreatic beta-cell function using a model-based analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for this analysis were from three large, placebo-controlled clinical studies that examined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg q.d. as add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy or as monotherapy over 18 or 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these studies, subsets of patients consented to undergo extensive blood sampling as part of a nine-point meal tolerance test performed at baseline and study end-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected at -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min relative to the start of a meal and subsequently were assayed for plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters for beta-cell function were calculated using the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> minimal model, which estimates insulin secretion rate (ISR) and partitions the ISR into basal (Phi(b); ISR at basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations), static (Phi(s); ISR at above basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations following a meal) and dynamic (Phi(d); ISR in response to the rate of increase in above basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations following a meal) components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total responsivity index (Phi(total); average ISR over the average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration) is calculated as a function of Phi(s), Phi(d )and Phi(b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>)Insulin sensitivity was assessed with a validated composite index (ISI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disposition indices (DI), which assess insulin secretion in the context of changes in insulin sensitivity, were calculated as the product of Phiand ISI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When administered in combination with ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy or as monotherapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was associated with substantial reductions in postprandial glycaemic excursion following a meal challenge relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> produced significant (p &lt; 0.05 vs. placebo) improvements in Phi(s )and Phi(total), regardless of treatment regimen (add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or as monotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For Phi(d), there was a numerical, but not statistically significant, improvement with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> increased Phi(b), but the difference relative to placebo was only significant with monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ISI was not significantly different between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The DIs for the static, dynamic and total measures were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this model-based analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> improved beta-cell function relative to placebo in both fasting and postprandial states in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
