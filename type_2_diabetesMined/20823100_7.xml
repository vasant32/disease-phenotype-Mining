<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a positive family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a marker of increased genetic risk, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of physical inactivity on adipose tissue (AT) metabolism in FDR subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 13 FDR and 20 control (CON) subjects participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were studied before and after 10 days of bed rest using the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp technique combined with measurements of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, lipolysis, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> release from subcutaneous abdominal (SCAAT) and femoral (SCFAT) adipose tissue by the microdialysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of lipases was determined in biopsies from SCAAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before bed rest, the FDR subjects revealed significantly increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in SCAAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of lipases was significantly decreased in the SCAAT of FDR subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bed rest significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0008033'>decreased lipolysis</z:mp> and tended to increase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in the SCFAT of both CON and FDR subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In response to bed rest, SCAAT <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake significantly increased in CON subjects but not in FDR subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FDR subjects exhibit an abnormal AT metabolism including increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake prior to bed rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the differences between FDR and CON subjects in AT metabolism were attenuated during bed rest due to relatively more adverse changes in CON subjects compared with FDR subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Physical inactivity per se is not more deleterious in FDR subjects as compared with CON subjects with respect to derangements in AT metabolism </plain></SENT>
