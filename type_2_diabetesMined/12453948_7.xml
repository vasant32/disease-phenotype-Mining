<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies have implicated increased plasminogen-activated inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) as a marker or predictor of accelerated coronary atherosclerotic disease in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether metabolic control, independent of its oral mode of implementation, affects PAI-1 in patients with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 91 subjects were screened, subjected to a 4-week drug washout, and randomized to daily treatment with glipizide GITS (maximum 20 mg, n = 46) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (maximum 2,550 mg, n = 45) as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After monotherapy, combination therapy was initiated by adding the second agent to the regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (fasting and postprandial), HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, and PAI-1 were assayed before and after randomization and sequentially thereafter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects; hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output (HGO) and abdominal fat distribution were each measured in a subset of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycemic control was markedly impaired at baseline (mean HbA(1c) 10.4 +/- 0.2% glipizide GITS; 10.0 +/- 0.2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) but improved comparably with each agent as monotherapy and in combination (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. baseline), as assessed with meal tolerance studies, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> values, and HGO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight and abdominal fat distribution did not change significantly in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 concentrations were extraordinarily high (5- to 10-fold more than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) at baseline (202 +/- 12 ng/ml glipizide GITS; 201 +/- 13 ng/ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) but declined comparably, and significantly, after treatment with either agent as monotherapy and decreased further with combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is profound, increases in PAI-1 are also profound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> with either glipizide GITS, an insulin secretagogue, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as monotherapy comparably ameliorates elevated PAI-1 </plain></SENT>
