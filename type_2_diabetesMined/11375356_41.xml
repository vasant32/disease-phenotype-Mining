<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, measured as HbA(1c), and frequency of self-monitoring in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daily self-monitoring is believed to be important for patients treated with insulin or oral agents to detect asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and to guide patient and provider behavior toward reaching blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A national sample of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was studied in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on therapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, frequency of self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HbA(1c) values were obtained by structured questionnaires and by clinical and laboratory assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the data, 29% of patients treated with insulin, 65% treated with oral agents, and 80% treated with diet alone had never monitored their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or monitored it less than once per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Self-monitoring at least once per day was practiced by 39% of those taking insulin and 5-6% of those treated with oral agents or diet alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients combined, the proportion of patients who tested their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased with an increasing HbA(1c) value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when examined by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy category, there was little relationship between HbA(1c) value and the proportion testing at least once per day or the proportion testing at least once per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the increase in frequency of self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with increasing HbA(1c) value was associated with the higher proportion of insulin-treated patients in higher HbA(1c) categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy categories, the frequency of self-monitoring was not related to glycemic control, as measured by HbA(1c) level </plain></SENT>
