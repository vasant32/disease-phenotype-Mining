<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine newly diagnosed DM subjects underwent: neurological examination, nerve conduction studies (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>), quantitative sensory system and cardiovascular autonomic function assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>Peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> was observed in 72% of the subjects (its staging was similar to that of patients with longer disease history), while another 10% of them showed a borderline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Deep Breathing test was abnormal in 28% of the patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo> was found in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same proportion (82%) of subjects who scored positively on the DNI showed altered <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, while the quantitative sensory system assessments had a low sensitivity in order to detect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between metabolic indexes and DNI/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of peripheral and autonomic function alterations suggests that each newly diagnosed diabetic subject should be screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> by the DNI, to reduce the negative prognostic influence of this complication </plain></SENT>
