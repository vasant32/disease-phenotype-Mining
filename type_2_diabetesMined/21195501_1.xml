<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a national, cross-sectional, multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and SU dual therapy were recruited by 54 investigators between January 2009 and August 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were asked to complete a QoL instrument, the EuroQol-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D), and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> Fear Survey (HFS-II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigators completed a web-based case report form on laboratory values, medical history and anti-diabetic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 430 patients (60% male) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately one fifth of the patients experienced moderate or worse symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who experienced moderate or worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> had lower QoL as measured by the weighted EQ-5D summary score (0.81 vs. 0.88; p&lt;0.001) than patients who experienced mild or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Experience of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was found to be associated with lower QoL in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on dual treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and sulphonylurea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This should be taken into consideration when selecting treatment for these patients in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
