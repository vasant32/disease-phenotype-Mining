<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have therefore investigated insulin antibodies and insulin-anti-insulin complexes both in pregnant diabetic women during pregnancy and in umbilical cord blood from their new-born infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven diabetic pregnant women and 23 new-born-infants of these diabetic women were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the pregnant patients were studied at the end of pregnancy and in 27, at least on one other occasion during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were treated with insulin during pregnancy: 26 had Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 14 Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and seven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin antibodies were found in 62% of the Type 1 diabetic patients, in 71% of the Type 2 diabetic patients and in 43% of the gestational diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were present in 48% of the infants studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin-anti-insulin complexes were found in 37% of the women with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in 21% of those with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 14% of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complexes were found in 38% of the new-born infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of these complexes in the babies was more strongly correlated with their occurrence in their mothers at the beginning than at the end of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin-anti-insulin complexes are thus present in the neonatal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They may differ from those in their mothers and they may have pathophysiological and clinical importance </plain></SENT>
