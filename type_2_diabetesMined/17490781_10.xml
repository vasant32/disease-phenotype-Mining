<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TS and QoL were assessed at baseline, weeks 12 and 24 within the Canadian INSIGHT, a randomized 24-week trial of Type 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 366 patients randomized to either the insulin glargine arm (n=182) or the adjusted OAD therapy arm (n=184) completed both questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, TS and QoL were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1c reduction was greater in the insulin glargine arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TS improved from baseline in both treatment arms; however, there was greater increase with insulin glargine+OAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perceived frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were lower at week 24, with no differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perceived frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> improved with glargine at week 12, and no difference was found at 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, QoL improved in both groups, but significantly more with glargine at both weeks 12 and 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improving <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control by adding insulin glargine to OAD therapy had a positive impact on TS and general QoL without complaints related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
