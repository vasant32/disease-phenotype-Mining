<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restriction endonuclease Rsa I digestion showed polymorphism of the human insulin receptor gene, with a band at 6.7 Kb, 6.2 Kb or 3.6 Kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the 6.7 Kb band was less than that in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the Japanese subjects examined lacked a 3.6 Kb band, which is commonly found in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also detected restriction fragment length polymorphism in the human insulin receptor gene by Pvu II or Stu I digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no significant association of restriction fragment length polymorphism with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found in the present study, our results suggest that the restriction fragment length polymorphism in the human insulin receptor gene varies among ethnic groups, and that the restriction fragment length polymorphism linked to the human insulin receptor gene might be a useful marker for the linkage study of the genes located close to the human insulin receptor gene on chromosome 19 </plain></SENT>
