<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty in-depth interviews were conducted in persons identified as: age ≥40 years, diagnosed with T2DM for ≥2 years, on oral antihyperglycemic medications &gt;3 months, BMI 30-35 kg/m(2), having attempted to lose weight in the last 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants (60% female, mean age 53 years, 53% Caucasian, mean BMI 32.2 kg/m(2)) agreed that 5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, while not reflective of an ultimate goal, would be meaningful and important; benefits were expected to accrue in physical functioning, self-confidence, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and motivation to keep losing weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants reported the greatest effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on energy, physical activity, mobility, pain, and clothes/appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants reported weight affecting mood, with feelings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and frustration most commonly described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This research indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> is likely to affect health-related quality of life in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the purported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> benefits of many emerging diabetic medications, it will be important to include measures of weight-related quality of life in future clinical trials of these agents </plain></SENT>
