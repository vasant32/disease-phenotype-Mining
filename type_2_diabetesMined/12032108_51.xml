<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Studies of the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> metabolic control and adherence to drug therapy have yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because low socioeconomic and minority populations have poorer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes and greater barriers to adherence, we examined the relationship between adherence and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> metabolic control in a large indigent population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population consisted of patients receiving medical care from a university-based internal medicine clinic serving a low-income population in rural central Virginia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample comprised 810 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who received oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications from the clinic pharmacy and had at least one HbA(1c) determination during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association of HbA(1c) level as well as change in HbA(1c) level with medication adherence, demographic, and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Better metabolic control was independently associated with greater medication adherence, increasing age, white (versus African-American) race, and lower intensity of drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each 10% increment in drug adherence, HbA(1c) decreased by 0.16% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Controlling for other demographic and clinical variables, the mean HbA(1c) of African-Americans was 0.29% higher than that of whites (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the intensity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drug therapy for African-Americans was lower, as was their measured adherence to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association between metabolic control and gender, income, encounter frequency, frequency of HbA(1c) testing, or continuity of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to medication regimens for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is strongly associated with metabolic control in an indigent population; African-Americans have lower adherence and worse metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Greater efforts are clearly needed to facilitate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management behaviors of low-income populations and foster culturally sensitive and appropriate care for minority groups </plain></SENT>
