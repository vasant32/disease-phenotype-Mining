<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative contributions of basal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (BHG) versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (PPHG) before and after treatment intensification in patients with glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (A1C) &gt;7.0% while on prior oral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Self-measured, plasma-referenced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles and A1C values were evaluated from participants in six studies comparing systematically titrated insulin glargine with an alternative regimen (adding basal, premixed, or prandial insulin, or increasing oral agents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hyperglycemic exposure (&gt;100 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L]) as a result of BHG versus PPHG was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On prior oral therapy, 1,699 participants (mean age 59 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 9 years) had mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) of 194 mg/dL (10.8 mmol/L), and mean A1C was 8.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BHG contributed an average of 76-80% to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> over the observed range of baseline A1C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adding basal insulin for 24 or 28 weeks lowered mean FPG to 117 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L), A1C to 7.0%, and BHG contribution to 32-41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternative regimens reduced FPG to 146 mg/dL (8.1 mmol/L), A1C to 7.1%, and the contribution of BHG to 64-71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BHG contributions for patients with A1C averaging 7.6-7.7% were 76% at baseline and 34 and 68% after adding basal insulin or other therapies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When A1C is &gt;7.0% despite oral therapy, BHG routinely dominates exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intensified therapy reduces A1C and changes this relationship, but BHG amenable to further intervention still accounts for one-third of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> after basal insulin treatment and two-thirds after alternative methods </plain></SENT>
