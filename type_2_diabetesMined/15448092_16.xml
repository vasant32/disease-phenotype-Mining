<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed an IUGR model in rats whereby at age 3-6 months the animals develop a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed at age 8 weeks, before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basal hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (HGP) was significantly higher in IUGR than in control rats (14.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 12.3 +/- 0.3 mg </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate 2 and Akt-2 phosphorylation were significantly blunted in IUGR rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that an aberrant intrauterine milieu permanently impairs insulin signaling in the liver so that gluconeogenesis is augmented in the IUGR rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These processes occur early in life, before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and indicate that uteroplacental insufficiency causes a primary defect in gene expression and hepatic metabolism that leads to the eventual development of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
