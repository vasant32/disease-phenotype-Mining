<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined 10 linkage disequilibrium (LD)-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (SNP1 to SNP10) for the IL6R gene in a nested case-control study of 672 diabetic and 1,058 healthy European Caucasian women (IL-6 levels were measured in a subgroup of 1,348 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both control and diabetic patients, polymorphisms within an LD block spanning approximately 42 kb were significantly associated with plasma IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A missense variant SNP7 in exon 9 (rs8192284, Asp358Ala) showed the strongest association (P = 0.0005 in control and P = 0.004 in case subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding false-discovery rates, which accounts for multiple testing, were 0.008 and 0.02, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We inferred five common haplotypes to capture 94% allele variance of the LD block using SNP5, -7, -8, -9, and -10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the most common haplotype 12111 (one codes the common and two codes the minor alleles), haplotypes 11211 [difference in log(IL-6) = -0.11 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.01); P = 0.01] and 21122 (-0.15 [-0.27 to -0.03]; P = 0.01) were associated with significantly lower IL-6 levels (global test, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, IL6R genotypes were not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IL6R genetic variations, especially SNP7 (rs8192284, Asp358Ala), were significantly associated with plasma IL-6 levels but not with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The strong associations between IL6R genetic variability and IL-6 concentrations deserve further investigation </plain></SENT>
