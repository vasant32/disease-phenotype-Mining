<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Energy expenditure induces the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) gene, providing a mechanism for insulin-independent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The object was to test 1) the association of genetic variation in eNOS, as assessed by haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 2) the interaction between eNOS haplotypes and total energy expenditure on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate models, we tested associations between eNOS htSNPs and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 461 and 474 case and control subjects, respectively) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (two cohorts of n = 706 and 738 U.K. and Spanish Caucasians, respectively), and we tested eNOS x total energy expenditure interactions on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An overall association between eNOS haplotype and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to the most common haplotype (111), two haplotypes (121 and 212) tended to increase <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.96-1.55), and one (122) was associated with decreased risk (0.58, 0.39-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cohort studies, no association was observed between haplotypes and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &gt; 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we observed a significant total energy expenditure-haplotype interaction (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation at the eNOS locus is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which may be attributable to an enhanced effect of total energy expenditure on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in individuals with specific eNOS haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene-environment interactions such as this may help explain why replication of genetic association frequently fails </plain></SENT>
