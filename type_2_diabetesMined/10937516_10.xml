<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (30 men and 20 women, mean age 48.6 years) and 30 age-matched control subjects (18 men and 12 women, mean age 49.2 years) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No patients showed serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels in excess of 2.0 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary podocytes were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies against podocalyxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urinary podocytes were detected in 18 of the 50 microalbuminuric diabetic patients (mean, 1.3 cells/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urinary podocytes were not detected in the remaining 32 patients or in the 30 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients positive for urinary podocytes were divided into 2 treatment groups: a dilazep dihydrochloride treatment group (300 mg/day; n = 9, group A) and a placebo group (n = 9, group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatments were continued for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group A, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> decreased significantly from 146 +/- 42 to 86 +/- 28 microg/min (P &lt; 0.01) and urinary podocytes also decreased from 1.3 +/- 0.8 to 0.4 +/- 0.2 cells/ml (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in group B, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and urinary podocytes changed little over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Podocyte injury may occur in patients with early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and dilazep dihydrochloride may be useful for preventing glomerular injury </plain></SENT>
