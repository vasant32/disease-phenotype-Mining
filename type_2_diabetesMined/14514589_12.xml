<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (21 nonsmoking men, aged 36-80 years) each received two of three doses of 80, 160, or 240 units inhaled regular insulin, delivered via a clinical Aerodose insulin inhaler, and two of three corresponding doses of 8, 16, or 24 units by subcutaneous injection under isoglycemic clamp conditions on 4 separate study days in an incomplete block design study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates (GIRs) and serum insulin concentrations were monitored over the following 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inhaled insulin exhibited significantly shorter time-to-peak insulin levels (T(max) 77 +/- 66 vs. 193 +/- 104 min, P &lt; 0.001) and time-to-peak metabolic effects (T(GIRmax) 240 +/- 94 vs. 353 +/- 60 min, P &lt; 0.001) compared with subcutaneously injected insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of total insulin absorption (insulin area under the curve [AUC]) versus total metabolic effect (GIR-AUC) from 0 to 8 h (group means) revealed overlapping dose-response relationships for both inhaled and subcutaneous injection treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of slopes revealed no significant differences between the inhaled and subcutaneous injection treatment groups (P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in either relative bioavailability or relative biopotency were found among doses, indicating a consistent subcutaneous injection-to-inhaled dosing conversion ratio among doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events or clinically relevant changes in lung function were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overlapping dose-response curves of inhaled and subcutaneous treatments together with a consistent relative bioavailability and relative biopotency for inhaled insulin across doses suggest that the Aerodose insulin inhaler will deliver a pharmacologically predictable insulin dose to patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> similar to that observed following subcutaneous injection </plain></SENT>
