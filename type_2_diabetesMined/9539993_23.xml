<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the inherent potential of glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> as a screening test for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by determining the biological variation in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: HbA1c values were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 12 nondiabetic subjects (7 men and 5 women; median age, 40 years [range, 21-55 years]) on 10 fortnightly occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nondiabetic index of individuality (IOI) for HbA1c (i.e., the square root of the ratio of intra- to interindividual variance) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Any test with an IOI of 1.4 has the most potential in disease screening, while one of 0.6 will be of little value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analytical variance contributed to 9% of the total test variance, intraindividual variance, 6%; and interindividual variance, 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IOI was, therefore, only 0.27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, nondiabetic HbA1c values vary markedly between subjects, while values in the same individual change little with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As such, to lie outside the assay reference range, the HbA1c values of some nondiabetic subjects must exceed 12 SD from their usual mean value, while in others a change of only 2 SD would be sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This fundamental characteristic of HbA1c means that even if analytical methods improve, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> measurements will always be of limited value when screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If similar interindividual differences also exist in diabetic subjects, then patients with the same glycemic control may vary by at least 1-2%, which has implications in setting glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> targets </plain></SENT>
