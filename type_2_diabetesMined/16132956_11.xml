<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and variation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha (TNF) has shown inconsistent associations with susceptibility to both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the coding non-synonymous variant T60N in the neighbouring LTA gene has been reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to obtain a robust assessment of the role of variation in the tightly linked TNF/LTA region in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility by genotyping TNF and LTA variants in large case-control resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The G-308A and G-238A TNF promoter variants and the LTA T60N polymorphism were genotyped in two UK case samples that were ascertained for positive family history and/or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (combined n=858) and in 1,257 ethnically matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant associations between the T60N, G-308A or G-238A genotype and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the combined analysis (exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic for ordered genotypes for T60N, p=0.69; for G-308A, p=0.51; for G-238A, p=0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study, one of the largest association analyses yet reported at this locus, provides no evidence that the specific TNF or LTA variants examined influence susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More comprehensive studies of the TNF/LTA locus in substantially larger sample sets are required to establish whether genome sequence variation at this locus truly influences susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
