<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The relationship between cigarette smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has predominantly been documented in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between cigarette smoking and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a large cross-sectional study carried out in male subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in modulating this relationship was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight current smokers and 158 never smokers with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were consecutively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low GFR was defined as GFR &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of patients affected by low GFR was significantly higher in current smokers (20.9 vs. 12.0%, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted risk (odds ratio [OR]) of low GFR in current smokers was 2.20 (95% CI 1.14-4.26, P = 0.02) and markedly higher in patients from the first tertile of disease duration (4.27 [1.26-14.40], P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was added to the statistical model exploring the relationship between smoking and low GFR, the risk of low GFR showed a small change, although it did not become any more significant (1.84 [0.98-3.45], P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current smokers showed even higher free oxygen radical test unit values (560.0 +/- 91.5 vs. 442.7 +/- 87.2, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large population of male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the risk of low GFR is markedly enhanced by smoking and is at least partially mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
