<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature search on MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using specific search terms 'GLP-1 insulin type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinical trials' and eight eligible studies were retrieved </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from eight RCTs enrolling 2782 patients were pooled using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean net change [95% confidence interval (CIs)] for HbA1c, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and FPG for patients treated with GLP-1 RA as compared with insulin was -0.14% (-2 mmol/mol) [95% CI; (-0.27, -0.02)%; p = 0.03]; -4.40 kg [95% CI; (-5.23, -3.56) kg; p &lt; 0.01] and 1.18 mmol/l [95% CI; (0.43, 1.93) mmol/l; p &lt; 0.01], respectively, with negative values favouring GLP-1 and positive values favouring insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GLP-1 group was associated with a greater reduction in <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> than the insulin group </plain></SENT>
