<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether 4 weeks of near normalisation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) improves the potentiation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion by GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA(1c) 8.0+/-0.4%) were investigated before and after 4 weeks of near normalisation of BG using insulin treatment (mean diurnal blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6.4+/-0.3 mmol/l, HbA(1c) 6.6+/-0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine matched healthy participants were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beta cell function was investigated before and after insulin treatment using stepwise <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusions and infusion of saline or GLP-1 (1.0 pmol kg(-1) min(-1)), resulting in supraphysiological total GLP-1 concentrations of approximately 200 pmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>+GLP-1 was expressed as the slope of the linear regression line relating insulin secretion rate (ISR) and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (pmol kg(-1) min(-1) [mmol/l](-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the diabetic participants, the slopes during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>+saline infusion did not differ before and after insulin treatment (0.33+/-0.07 and 0.39+/-0.04, respectively; p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, near normalisation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> improved beta cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>+GLP-1 infusion (1.27+/-0.2 before vs 1.73+/-0.31 after; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the healthy participants, the slopes during the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>+saline and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>+GLP-1 infusions were 1.01+/-0.14 and 4.79+/-0.53, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A supraphysiological dose of GLP-1 enhances beta cell responses to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 4 weeks of near normalisation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> further improves this effect </plain></SENT>
