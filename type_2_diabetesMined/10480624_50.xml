<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma cell differentiation antigen (PC-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> inhibits insulin receptor signaling and is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here a novel polymorphism in exon 4 of the PC-1 gene (K121Q) and demonstrate that it is strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in 121 healthy nonobese (BMI &lt;30 kg/m2) nondiabetic (by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test [OGTT]) Caucasians from Sicily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with 80 KK subjects, Q allele carriers (n = 41, 39 KQ and 2 QQ) showed higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels during OGTT (P &lt; 0.001 by two-way analysis of variance) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by euglycemic clamp (M value = 5.25 +/- 1.38 [n = 24] vs. 6.30 +/- 1.39 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) [n = 49], P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Q carriers had higher risk of being hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant (odds ratio [CI]: 2.99 [1.28-7.0], P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptor autophosphorylation was reduced (P &lt; 0.01) in cultured skin fibroblasts from KQ versus KK subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle PC-1 content was not different in 11 KQ versus 32 KK subjects (33 +/- 16.1 vs. 17.5 +/- 15 ng/mg protein, P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a cause-effect relationship between the Q carrying genotype and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> phenotype, and raise the possibility that PC-1 genotyping could identify individuals who are at risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, a condition that predisposes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
