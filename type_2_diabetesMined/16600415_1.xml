<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We assessed whether the increased sequential changes in the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level (FPG) that is still within the normoglycemic range could be a predictor for future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with 5296 male employees, aged 31-44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sequential change in the FPG level was defined as the first follow-up FPG level minus the baseline FPG level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed at annual examinations during the next 4.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 21,575.5 person-years follow-up among the 5,296 subjects, a total of 156 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred (116 cases among the 4,975 normoglycemic subjects and 40 cases among the 321 subjects with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in the FPG level from the baseline to the first follow-up, although still within the normoglycemic range (FPG&lt;100 mg/dl), significantly predicted future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: the multivariate hazard ratios associated with the sequential changes in the FPG of &lt;-3, -3 to 3, 4-6, 7-9, and &gt;9 mg/dl were 0.75, 1.00 (reference), 2.28, 3.28, and 6.10, respectively (p for trend &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increase of the sequential changes in the FPG level that were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> range was associated with a higher risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, conducting assessment for the serial changes in the FPG level may help to identify the young, healthy, normoglycemic individuals at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
