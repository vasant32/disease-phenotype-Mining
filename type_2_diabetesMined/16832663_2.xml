<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that a glycosylating enzyme, core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GlcNAc-T), is implicated in increased leucocyte-endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> via an upregulation mechanism controlled by TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the functional link between circulating TNF-alpha and the activity and phosphorylation of core 2 GlcNAc-T in polymorphonuclear leucocytes of patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma levels of TNF-alpha, although similar in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were significantly higher than in age-matched healthy controls, and correlated well with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Core 2 GlcNAc-T activity followed the same trend and was associated with phosphorylation of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the observation that TNF-alpha levels are also linked to glycaemic values suggests that in patients, as well as in vitro, the glycosylation-mediated cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> process that plays a role in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> may involve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and TNF-alpha-induced protein kinase beta2 activation, and subsequently raise activity of core 2 GlcNAc-T through increased enzyme phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results reveal a novel rationale towards a specific treatment of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, based on the inhibition of core 2 GlcNAc-T activity and/or the blockage of cognate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
