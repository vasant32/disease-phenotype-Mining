<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 648 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to receive instruction in either a healthy food choices meal plan (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="46695">HFC</z:chebi>) or an exchange-based meal plan (EXCH) to compare the impact on glycemic control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and blood pressure at 6 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary practices were assessed with food frequency questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At presentation, the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="46695">HFC</z:chebi> and EXCH groups were comparable in age (52 years), sex (65% women), weight (94 kg), BMI (33.5), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4.8 years), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (10.5 mmol/l), and HbA(1c) (9.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improvements in glycemic control over 6 months were significant (P &lt; 0.0001) but similar in both groups: HbA(1c) decreased from 9.7 to 7.8% with the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="46695">HFC</z:chebi> and from 9.6 to 7.7% with the EXCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were comparable in both groups, whereas other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and blood pressure were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="10" ids="46695">HFC</z:chebi> and EXCH groups exhibited similar improvement in dietary practices with respect to intake of fats and sugar sweetened foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, average weight change, the percentage of patients losing weight, and the distribution of weight lost were comparable with the two approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medical nutrition therapy is effective in urban African Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Either a meal plan emphasizing guidelines for healthy food choices or a low literacy exchange method is equally effective as a meal planning approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="46695">HFC</z:chebi> meal plan may be easier to teach and easier for patients to understand, it may be preferable for low-literacy patient populations </plain></SENT>
