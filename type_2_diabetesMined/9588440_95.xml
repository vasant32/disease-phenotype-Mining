<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nearly 20 years ago, it was suggested that individuals exist who are not <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> on the basis of height and weight, but who, like people with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, are hyperinsulinemic, insulin-resistant, and predisposed to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, and premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then it has become increasingly clear that such metabolically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight (MONW) individuals are very common in the general population and that they probably represent one end of the spectrum of people with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available evidence also suggests that MONW individuals could account for the higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and other disorders in people with a BMI in the 20-27 kg/m2 range who have gained modest amounts of weight (2-10 kg of adipose mass) in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific factors that appear to predispose MONW, as well as more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> include central fat distribution, inactivity, and a low VO2max </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because these factors are potentially reversible and because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases, it is our premise that a compelling argument can be made for identifying MONW individuals and treating them with diet, exercise, and possibly pharmacological agents before these diseases become overt, or at least early after their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One reason for doing so is that disorders such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be accompanied by irreversible consequences, e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, at the time of diagnosis or shortly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another is that MONW individuals in general should be younger and more amenable and responsive to diet and exercise therapy than are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with established disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>That long-term diet and exercise can work is suggested by two large studies in which, over 5-6 years, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diminished in nonobese and minimally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these considerations and the emerging worldwide epidemic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we believe that studies to assess whether therapies aimed at young MONW individuals can prevent the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other diseases, including perhaps <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> itself, are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
