<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the effect of high carbohydrate/low fat diet on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, we performed a 4-week crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Japanese subjects (30 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 15 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and 8 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance) were allocated either 55% standard carbohydrate/30% fat (sc) or 70% high carbohydrate/15% low fat (hc) diet for four weeks, and evaluated by OGTT and various parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, the diet was crossed over to another diet, and identical parameters were re-evaluated after four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration-time curve (AUG) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> did not show significant changes between the two diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-Cholesterol</z:chebi> and body mass index decreased significantly by hc diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Free fatty acids and homeostasis model assessment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index showed a tendency to be decreased by hc diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AUG hc/sc ratio was inversely correlated with AUG or free fatty acids on standard carbohydrate diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present 4-week high carbohydrate/low fat diet may be useful to reduce body weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 4-week high carbohydrate/low fat diet did not affect <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the 4-week high carbohydrate/low fat diet decreased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-Chol, it did not increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
