<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether 4 weeks of near-normalisation of the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level could improve insulin responses to GIP and GLP-1 in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with poor glycaemic control (HbA(1c) 8.6 +/- 1.3%), were investigated before and after 4 weeks of near-normalisation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 7.4 +/- 1.2 mmol/l) using insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after insulin treatment the participants underwent three hyperglycaemic clamps (15 mmol/l) with infusion of GLP-1, GIP or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin responses were evaluated as the incremental area under the plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before and after near-normalisation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses did not differ during the early phase of insulin secretion (0-10 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The late phase C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response (10-120 min) increased during GIP infusion from 33.0 +/- 8.5 to 103.9 +/- 24.2 (nmol/l) x (110 min)(-1) (p &lt; 0.05) and during GLP-1 infusion from 48.7 +/- 11.8 to 126.6 +/- 32.5 (nmol/l) x (110 min)(-1) (p &lt; 0.05), whereas during saline infusion the late-phase response did not differ before vs after near-normalisation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (40.2 +/- 11.2 vs 46.5 +/- 12.7 [nmol/l] x [110 min](-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Near-normalisation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for 4 weeks improves beta cell responsiveness to both GLP-1 and GIP by a factor of three to four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No effect was found on beta cell responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
