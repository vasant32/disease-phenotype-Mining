<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and reduced glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) concentration are linked to the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, beta-cell activity, and subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with GLP-1 concentrations and whether racial disparities in GLP-1 response were present in 49 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents (14 +/- 3 years; 76% African American; 71% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects underwent physical examination and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured levels of high-sensitivity CRP (CRP(hs)), fibrinogen, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, GLP-1(total), GLP-1(active), and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve (AUC), insulinogenic index (DeltaI30/DeltaG30), and composite insulin sensitivity index (CISI) were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized by race and as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> positive (INF+) if CRP(hs) or fibrinogen were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No racial differences were seen in mean or relative BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five percent of subjects had altered fasting or 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (African American vs. Caucasian, NS), and 75% were INF+ (African American vs. Caucasian, P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and insulin, CISI, and DeltaI30/DeltaG30 values were similar; African Americans had lower GLP-1(total) AUC (P = 0.01), GLP-1(active) at 15 min (P = 0.03), and GLP-1(active) AUC (P = 0.06) and higher fibrinogen (P = 0.01) and CRP(hs) (NS) compared with Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: African Americans exhibited lower GLP-1 concentrations and <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both mechanisms may act synergistically to enhance the predisposition of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> African Americans to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings might be relevant to effective deployment of emerging GLP-1-based treatments across ethnicities </plain></SENT>
