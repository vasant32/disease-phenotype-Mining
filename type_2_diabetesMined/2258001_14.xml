<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the synthesis of a structurally abnormal or mutant protein may contribute to the formation of amyloid deposits, we have examined the possibility that a mutant form of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> or its precursor contributes to the formation of islet amyloid in Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced the islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> precursor coding regions of the gene of 25 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA fragments corresponding to exon 2 and 3 of the islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> gene were amplified from patients' peripheral blood leucocyte DNAs using the polymerase chain reaction and specific oligonucleotide primer sets, and then directly sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequences of the amplified regions of both alleles of the islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> gene of these 25 patients were identical to one another and to the sequence of an islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> allele isolated from a human fetal liver genomic library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a primary structural abnormality of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> or its precursor is unlikely to play a significant role in the formation of islet amyloid in Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
