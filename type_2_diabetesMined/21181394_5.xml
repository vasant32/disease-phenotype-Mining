<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to evaluate intramyocellular and intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in 50 male and 42 female multi-ethnic, prepubertal (Tanner &lt; 2) children (8.1 ± 0.8 years; 35.4 ± 10.7 kg; 27.9 ± 8.3% body fat; means ± SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> was measured in soleus muscle and intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> in the middle right lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abdominal fat was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, body fat by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> using homeostatic model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ranged from 0.11% to 4.6% relative to the liver water signal (mean 0.79 ± 0.79%) whereas intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ranged from 0.13% to 1.86% relative to the muscle water signal (mean 0.51 ± 0.28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intramyocellular and intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were significantly correlated with total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (r = 0.49 and 0.59), abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (r = 0.44 and 0.54), and each other (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.05, Spearman) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both intramyocellular and intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> were positively correlated with fasting insulin (r = 0.37 and 0.38 respectively) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (r = 0.37 and 0.37; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for race and sex, the relations between ectopic fat and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> remained, whereas both disappeared when further adjusted for body fat or BMI z scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: These results suggest that typical relations between body composition, ectopic fat and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are present in children before puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, interventions aimed at reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> have the potential to decrease ectopic fat accumulation, delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and decrease the risk for development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children </plain></SENT>
