<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Significant progress has been made in recent years in the characterisation of the signal pathways of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glucolipotoxicity acts as an exogenous factor whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and endoplasmic reticulum stress may result from the processes of signal recognition and stimulated secretion within the beta cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pharmacological stimulation of secretion may thus appear to be a double-edged sword: it counteracts <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, but may do so at the expense of beta cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So, in the long run, insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs might do more harm than good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, much of this logic is derived by analogy from the long-held assumption that beta cell hypersecretion imposed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> causes the absolute secretion deficit in the later course of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this concept the beta cell has a secondary role and loss of beta cell mass is necessary for the manifestation of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that a secretion deficit can exist well before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and that major genetic risk factors concern beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the evidence for a beta cell toxic effect of insulinotropic drugs is currently inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assuming that the insulin secretion deficit is of pathogenetic importance in a network with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as an aggravating factor, an insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drug may do more good than harm if it relieves the beta cell from the stress of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> overstimulation and does so without inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
