<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (RSG) vs. sulphonylurea (SU) dose escalation in older type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) patients inadequately controlled on SU therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 227 T2DM patients from 48 centres in the USA and Canada, aged &gt; or =60 years, were randomized to receive RSG (4 mg) or placebo once daily in combination with glipizide 10 mg twice daily for 2 years in a double-blind, parallel-group study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous SU monotherapy was (1/4) to (1/2) maximum recommended dose for &gt; or =2 months prior to screening with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &gt; or =7.0 and &lt; or =13.9 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment options were individualized, and escalation of study medication was specifically defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disease progression (time to reach confirmed FPG &gt; or =10 mmol/l while on maximum doses of both glipizide and study medication or placebo) was reported in 28.7% of patients uptitrating SU plus placebo compared with only 2.0% taking RSG and SU combination (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RSG + SU significantly decreased HbA(1c), FPG, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, plasma free fatty acids and medical care utilization and improved treatment satisfaction compared with uptitrated SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of RSG to SU in older T2DM patients significantly improved glycaemic control and reduced disease progression compared with uptitrated SU alone but without increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These benefits were associated with increased patient treatment satisfaction and reduced medical care utilization with regards to emergency room visits and length of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early addition of RSG is an effective treatment option for older T2DM patients inadequately controlled on submaximal SU monotherapy </plain></SENT>
