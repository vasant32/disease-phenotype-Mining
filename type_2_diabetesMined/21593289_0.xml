<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and subsequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after the index pregnancy among 25,305 women who reported at least one singleton pregnancy between 1991 and 2007 in the Nurses' Health Study II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 16 years of follow-up, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> developed in 1,414 women (5.6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> developed in 3,138 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> had a 26% increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> compared with those without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (hazard ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43]; P=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were independent of pregnancy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or subsequent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> are at a significant increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after the index pregnancy </plain></SENT>
