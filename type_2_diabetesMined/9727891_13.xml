<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 26-week double-blind study with open-label extension included patients who had failed previous oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication and took &gt; or =30 but &lt;150 U of insulin daily The 222 patients in the double-blind study received 200 or 400 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> once daily or matching placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the proportion of patients meeting the target of &gt; or =50% reduction in injected insulin and either a 15% reduction in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or a blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;7.8 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin dose was reduced 25% based on a study-specific algorithm whenever fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reduced 5% from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also of interest were changes in insulin dose and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The open-label extension included 173 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They received 200 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> with optional titration to 400 mg, and insulin dose was adjusted based on investigators' standards of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Open-label measures were change in insulin dose, HbA1c, and fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FSG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the double-blind phase, 22 and 27% of the 200- and 400-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> groups, respectively, reached target, compared with placebo (7%) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin dose reductions of 13 +/- 3, 30 +/- 3, and 41 +/- 3 U were observed for placebo, 200-, and 400-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> groups, respectively HbA1c decreased 0.09 +/- 0.14% for placebo, 0.13 +/- 0.14% for 200 mg, and 0.41 +/- 0.14% for 400 mg (P &lt; 0.05) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the open-label extension, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment resulted in &gt;50% reduction from baseline in daily insulin dose and decreases in HbA1c of 1% and in FSG of &gt;17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> decreases daily injected insulin dose requirements and improves glycemic control in insulin-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
