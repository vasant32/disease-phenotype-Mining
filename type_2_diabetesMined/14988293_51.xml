<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple self-administered questionnaire identifying individuals with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a sensitivity of 75% and minimizing the high-risk group needing subsequent testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based sample (Inter99 study) of 6,784 individuals aged 30-60 years completed a questionnaire on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related symptoms and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk score was derived from the first half and validated on the second half of the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>External validation was performed based on the Danish Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Primary Care (ADDITION) pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk score was developed by stepwise backward multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final risk score included age, sex, BMI, known <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, physical activity at leisure time, and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, items independently and significantly (P&lt;0.05) associated with the presence of previously undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.804 (95% CI 0.765-0.838) for the first half of the Inter99 population, 0.761 (0.720-0.803) for the second half of the Inter99 population, and 0.803 (0.721-0.876) for the ADDITION pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and percentage that needed subsequent testing were 76, 72, and 29%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The false-negative individuals in the risk score had a lower absolute risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> compared with the true-positive individuals (11.3 vs. 20.4%; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We developed a questionnaire to be used in a stepwise screening strategy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, decreasing the numbers of subsequent tests and thereby possibly minimizing the economical and personal costs of the screening strategy </plain></SENT>
