<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In humans, it is unclear if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> at the monocyte level is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we have studied first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to investigate whether a reduction in components of the insulin signal transduction pathways, such as the insulin receptor (InsR) or InsR substrate 1 or 2 (IRS1 or IRS2), or a reduction in genetic modifiers of insulin action, such as the TIMP3/ADAM17 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3/A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 17) pathway, is associated with evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin sensitivity was analyzed through euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was analyzed through intimal medial thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monocytes were isolated through magnetic cell sorting, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and proteins were extracted and analyzed by quantitative PCR and pathscan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In monocyte cells from human subjects with increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, we found that gene expression, protein levels, and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2, but not InsR or IRS1, were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TIMP3 was also reduced, along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, resulting in increased ectodomain shedding activity of the metalloprotease ADAM17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are associated with decreased IRS2 and TIMP3 expression in circulating monocytes </plain></SENT>
