<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin day profiles between two prandial rapid-acting insulin analogues, insulin glulisine (glulisine) and insulin lispro (lispro), in 18 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects (body mass index: males, 36.7 [33.2-43.8] kg/m(2); females, 40.0 [35.7-46.5] kg/m(2)) received subcutaneous glulisine or lispro (0.15 U/kg) at 4-h intervals immediately (within 2 min) before three standard test meals during each of two 12-h, randomised, open-label, crossover studies (7+/-2-day interval between each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, preprandial-subtracted <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (area under the curve) were similar on the glulisine and lispro study days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the mean of the three maximal preprandial subtracted plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (DeltaGLU(max)) were lower with glulisine versus lispro (12%; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean concentrations of insulin analogue were significantly higher post-meal with glulisine (p&lt;0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post hoc analysis showed a significantly faster absorption rate for glulisine versus lispro in the first 30 min post-meal (estimated difference 0.48 microU/min; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were reported; both from one subject during the lispro day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When glulisine is injected immediately before a meal in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, glulisine achieves significantly lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions over lispro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly faster absorption with higher and sustained post-meal levels of insulin analogue was achieved at every meal with glulisine versus lispro </plain></SENT>
