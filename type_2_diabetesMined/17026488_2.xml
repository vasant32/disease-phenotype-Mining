<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explored the safety and efficacy of open-label treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (RSG/MET) fixed-dose combination therapy (AVANDAMET) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with very poor glycaemic control, to better characterize the magnitude of glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1c) reduction after 24 weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label trial, 190 patients with an A1c greater than 11% or fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) greater than 15 mmol/l were included after failing to meet glycaemic entry criteria for a primary double-blind, controlled, randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unless tolerability issues arose, eligible patients initiated RSG/MET 4 mg/1000 mg fixed-dose combination therapy and were up-titrated in increments of 2 mg/500 mg at 4-week intervals to a daily dose of 8 mg/2000 mg or the maximum tolerated dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed for efficacy and safety at five visits over a 24-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline in A1c at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary efficacy end points included the proportion of patients achieving defined A1c targets, change from baseline to week 24 in FPG and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients (78%) completed 24 weeks of open-label treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At week 24, clinically significant mean reduction in A1c from 11.8 to 7.8% (mean reduction, 4.0 +/- 2.2%; p &lt; 0.0001) and mean FPG reduction from 16.9 to 9.2 mmol/l (mean reduction, 7.7 +/- 4.4 mmol/l; p &lt; 0.0001) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A clinically significant reduction in FPG (5.2 mmol/l) was observed after 4 weeks of treatment with RSG/MET fixed-dose combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite a high mean baseline A1c of 11.8%, 33% of patients achieved treatment goal of A1c less than or equal to 6.5% at week 24, and 44% achieved an A1c less than 7% at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RSG/MET fixed-dose combination was well tolerated, with a low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (2%) and mean increase in weight from baseline of 2.6 +/- 5.2 kg, and few patients withdrew (2.6%) because of an adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RSG/MET fixed-dose combination therapy was effective as initial therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and very high levels of A1c and/or FPG, as demonstrated by robust and relatively rapid improvements in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RSG/MET fixed-dose combination was well tolerated as first-line therapy with no new tolerability issues identified </plain></SENT>
