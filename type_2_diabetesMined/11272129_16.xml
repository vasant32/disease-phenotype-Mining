<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature suggests that the concept of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immunemediated disease</z:mpath> emerged rapidly over the period from 1974 to 1976 and showed many of the features of a classic paradigm shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A few key observations triggered recognition and acceptance of the new paradigm, but the necessary context was provided by scientific developments in areas mainly unrelated to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease paradigm established by 1976 is still widely accepted, and its essential features have been modified only in detail by the revolution in molecular biology that has occurred over the intervening period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding, some of the underlying assumptions remain imprecise, unchallenged, or unconfirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Appreciation of the historical origin and subsequent evolution of these fundamental concepts could stimulate critical analysis and help prepare the way for a new paradigm </plain></SENT>
