<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective cohort study aimed to examine the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> on vascular events in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM codes (250.xx except for 250.x1 and 250.x3) between 1 January 2004 and 1 September 2010 from the Veterans Integrated Service Network 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Index date was defined as the first date of new antihyperglycemic medications (index treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with 1-year preindex records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, cardiovascular, and microvascular diseases were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> group was identified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM codes (250.8, 251.0, 251.1, and 251.2) within the index treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A propensity score-matched group was used as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events, microvascular complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the unmatched sample (N = 44,261), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> incidence rate was 3.57/100 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The matched sample (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> group: n = 761; control group: n = 761) had a median follow-up of 3.93 years, mean age of 62.6 ± 11.0 years, and preindex HbA(1c) of 10.69 ± 2.61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1-year change in HbA(1c) was similar (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> group -0.51 vs. control group -0.32%, P = 0.7244) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> group had significantly higher risks of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 2.00 [95% CI 1.63-2.44]) and microvascular complications (1.76 [1.46-2.11]) but no statistical mortality difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with at least two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> were at higher risks of vascular events than those with one episode (1.53 [1.10-1.66]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is associated with higher risks of incident vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> should be monitored closely for vascular events </plain></SENT>
