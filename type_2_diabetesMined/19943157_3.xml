<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 9 years of follow-up in 9,221 middle-aged white and 2,724 African-American adults free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen NOS1AP variants were examined for associations with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels stratified by baseline CCB use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of CCB use at baseline was 2.7% (n = 247) in whites and 2.3% (n = 72) in African-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among white CCB users, the G allele of rs10494366 was associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92, p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association was marginally significant after adjusting for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, heart rate and electrocardiographic QT interval (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38-1.04, p = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rs10494366 was associated with lower average fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during follow-up (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other variants were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in CCB users after multiple-testing correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No associations were observed between any NOS1AP variant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development in non-CCB users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NOS1AP variants were not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in either African-American CCB users or non-CCB users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have independently replicated the association between rs10494366 in NOS1AP and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among white CCB users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further exploration of NOS1AP variants and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and functional studies of NOS1AP in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathology is warranted </plain></SENT>
