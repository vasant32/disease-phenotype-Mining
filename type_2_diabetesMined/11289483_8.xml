<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules were measured before and after 3 and 12 months of therapy in 81 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 41 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with bedtime administration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin combined with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (n = 19), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 17), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 17), or morning administration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before insulin therapy, serum sE-selectin level was 71% higher in the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (77 +/- 4 ng/ml) than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (45 +/- 3 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.001), whereas levels of sVCAM-1 were comparable (420 +/- 25 vs. 400 +/- 11 ng/ml, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients improved as judged from a decrease in HbA1c from 9.7 +/- 0.2 to 7.6 +/- 0.1% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>sE-selectin decreased to 67 +/- 4 ng/ml by 3 months (P &lt; 0.001 vs. 0 months) and then remained unchanged until 12 months (70 +/- 4 ng/ml P &lt; 0.001 vs 0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sVCnM-1 levels at 12 months was similar to those at 0 months (416 +/- 25 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in glycemic control, measured by HbA1c, but not in other parameters, was correlated with the change of sE-selectin (r = 0.41, P &lt; 0.001) within the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decreases in sE-selectin were not different between the various treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that improvement in glycemic control by administration of insulin alone or insulin combined with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or both agents induces a sustained decrease in sE-selectin, the magnitude of which seems to be dependent on the degree of improvement in glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that sE-selectin might provide a marker of effects of treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on endothelial activation </plain></SENT>
