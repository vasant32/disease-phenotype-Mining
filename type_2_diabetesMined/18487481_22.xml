<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="22888">biphenyls</z:chebi> (PCBs) and polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28145">dibenzofurans</z:chebi> (PCDFs) are important and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent cross-sectional studies have detected increased concentrations of serum POPs in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine the association between previous high exposures to PCBs and PCDFs and the cumulative incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the late 1970s, the consumption of rice-bran oil laced with PCBs poisoned thousands of Taiwanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 1993 and 2003, we examined 1,054 Yucheng ("oil disease") victims against neighborhood reference subjects using a protocol blinded for POP exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the results derived from 378 Yucheng subjects and 370 matched references </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk to members of the Yucheng cohort relative to their reference subjects was significantly increased for women (odds ratio [OR] 2.1 [95% CI 1.1-4.5]) but not for men after considering age, BMI, cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Yucheng women diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chloracne</z:e> had adjusted ORs of 5.5 (95% CI 2.3-13.4) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 3.5 (1.7-7.2) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> compared with those who were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chloracne</z:e> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Yucheng women, who had endured previous exposure to PCBs and PCDFs, suffered from increased incidences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly those who had retained significant levels of pollutant as evident from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chloracne</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When planning treatments against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the body burden of PCBs and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> should be carefully considered, especially for women </plain></SENT>
