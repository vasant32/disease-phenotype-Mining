<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The meta-analysis suggested that C allele of C47T polymorphism in SOD2 gene has protective effects on risk of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="47781">DMI</z:chebi>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
