<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fiber, glycemic load (GL), dietary glycemic index (GI), and fiber-rich foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 36,787 men and women aged 40-69 years without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> self-reported cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 4-year follow-up, confirmation of diagnosis was sought from medical practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case subjects were those who reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at follow-up and for whom there was no evidence that they did not have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed with logistic regression, adjusting for country of birth, physical activity, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, alcohol and energy intake, education, 5-year weight change, sex, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up was completed by 31,641 (86%) participants, and 365 cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) for the highest quartile of white bread intake compared with the lowest was 1.37 (95% CI 1.04-1.81; P for trend = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intakes of carbohydrate (OR per 200 g/day 0.58, 0.36-0.95), <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> (OR per 100 g/day 0.61, 0.47-0.79), and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (OR per 500 mg/day 0.62, 0.43-0.90) were inversely associated with incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas intake of <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> (OR per 100 g/day 1.47, 1.06-2.05) and dietary GI (OR per 10 units 1.32, 1.05-1.66) were positively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These relationships were attenuated after adjustment for BMI and waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reducing dietary GI while maintaining a high carbohydrate intake may reduce the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One way to achieve this would be to substitute white bread with low-GI breads </plain></SENT>
