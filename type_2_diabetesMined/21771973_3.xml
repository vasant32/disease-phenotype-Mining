<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both sRAGE and esRAGE have been proposed as biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), but prospective data are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship of sRAGE and esRAGE to incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients followed for 3.9 years in a trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>: the Collaborative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (CARDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a nested case-control design sampling <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> with available plasma and randomly selecting three control subjects, who were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> throughout follow-up, per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by Cox regression with adjustment for treatment allocation and relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: sRAGE and esRAGE were strongly correlated (œÅ = 0.88) and were both higher in those with lower BMI (P &lt; 0.001), higher adiponectin (P &lt; 0.001), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.009), and white ethnicity (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both sRAGE and esRAGE were associated with incident CHD events, independently of treatment allocation and the above factors; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.74 (95% CI 1.25-2.41; P = 0.002) for a doubling of the sRAGE level; HR = 1.45 (1.11-1.89; P = 0.006) for a doubling of the esRAGE level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; HR for sRAGE = 0.66 (0.38-1.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi>, 10 mg daily, did not alter sRAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of sRAGE and esRAGE are associated with incident CHD but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
