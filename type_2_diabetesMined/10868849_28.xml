<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 74 Hispanic patients and 113 EA patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recruited from managed care settings were assessed on three domains of family life (family structure/organization, family world view, and family emotion management [four scales]) and five areas of disease management (biological, general health and function status, emotional tone, quality of life, and behavioral [seven scales]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses assessed the independent associations of patient sex, family, and sex by family interactions with disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both sex and the three domains of family life were related to disease management, but the results varied by ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For EA patients, sex, family world view, and family emotion management were related to disease management (scores for Family Coherence were negatively associated with HbA1c level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and poor scores for Conflict Resolution were linked with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>); for Hispanic patients, sex and family structure/organization were related to disease management (high scores for Organized Cohesiveness were associated with good diet and exercise, and high scores for Family Sex-Role Traditionalism were related to high quality of life) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant interactions with sex occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of the family setting in which disease management takes place are significantly linked to patient self-care behavior, and these linkages vary by patient ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A family's multiple independent dimensions provide multiple targets for intervention, and differences in family norms, structures, and emotion management should be considered to ensure that interventions are compatible with the setting of disease management </plain></SENT>
