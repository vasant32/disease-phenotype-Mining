<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured the level of physical activity of 36 hospitalized (H) and 36 free-living nonhospitalized (NH) type 2 diabetic subjects with actimeters (SenseWear Arm-Band) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of steps (H: 4,381 +/- 3,742 steps/24 h, NH: 7,220 +/- 4,763 steps/24 h; P &lt; 0.01), duration of physical activity (H: 45 +/- 57 min/24 h, NH: 148 +/- 116 min/24 h; P &lt; 0.005), and physical activity expenditure (H: 287 +/- 390 kcal/24 h, NH: 1,035 +/- 1,006 kcal/24 h; P &lt; 0.005) were two- to threefold lower in the hospitalized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simple advice enabled us to increase their recorded levels of physical activity by approximately 50% (P &lt; 0.005), and a further 50% (P &lt; 0.05) was obtained by the use of a pedometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The physical inactivity of hospitalized patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is significant and remediable, although the advice given must take into account the existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
