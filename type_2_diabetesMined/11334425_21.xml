<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific phenotypic changes-prolonged action potentials, slowed cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> clearing, and slowed relaxation-that contribute to this whole heart dysfunction occur in isolated ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether cardiomyocyte abnormalities occur early in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (in this case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) and whether an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin-sensitizing drug</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) is cardioprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study, high-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> feeding was used to induce whole-body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were maintained for 7-10 weeks on a <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> (ST) diet, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> (SU) diet, or diet supplemented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (SU + MET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole-body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was measured in SU and SU + MET rats by performing euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanical properties of isolated ventricular myocytes were measured by high-speed video edge detection, and [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i transients were evaluated with Fura-2 AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Untreated SU rats were insulin-resistant (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate [GIR] = 14.5 +/- 1.1 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment in SU + MET rats prevented this metabolic abnormality (GIR = 20.0 +/- 2.2 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indexes of myocyte shortening and relengthening were significantly longer in SU rats (area under the relaxation phase [AR/peak] = 103 +/- 3 msec) when compared to ST and SU + MET rats (AR/peak = 73 +/- 2 and 80 +/- 1 msec, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> decay and the integral of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transient through the entire contractile cycle were significantly longer in myocytes from SU than from ST rats (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signal normalized to peak amplitude = 152 +/- 8 vs. 135 +/- 5 msec, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data showed the presence of cardiomyocyte abnormalities in an insulin-resistant stage that precedes frank type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> prevented the development of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the consequent cardiomyocyte dysfunction </plain></SENT>
