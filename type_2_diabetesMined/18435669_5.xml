<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess glycaemic control as well as changes in glycaemic control over time in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) who added a sulphonylurea (SU) or thiazolidinedione (TZD) to their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy in typical treatment settings within seven European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional multicentre study with retrospective medical chart review was conducted in Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Spain and UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2DM patients who added a SU or a TZD to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy between January 2001 and January 2006 (i.e. index date) and who had &gt; or = 1 haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) measurement within 12 months before the visit date, which occurred from June 2006 to February 2007, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main study outcome measure was the proportion of patients with adequate glycaemic control (defined according to the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation as HbA1C &lt; 6.5%) using the most recent HbA1C measurement before the visit date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients were grouped based upon the interval from the index date to the most recent HbA1C measurement to evaluate goal attainment and treatment changes over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: In this European cohort of 2023 T2DM patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and either an SU or a TZD (mean age = 60.4 years), 25.5% of patients had adequate glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average HbA1C level was 7.2% after a mean of 2.6 years of treatment with combination oral antihyperglycaemic agent (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the patients (n = 227) with most recent HbA1C measurement within 1 year after first adding an SU or a TZD, 27% had adequate glycaemic control (HbA1C &lt; 6.5%), with a mean (s.d.) HbA1C of 7.1% (1.0); 1.3% of these patients were using some type of insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the patients (n = 176) with most recent HbA1C measurement occurring &gt; or = 5 years after adding an SU or a TZD, 20% had adequate glycaemic control, with a mean (s.d.) HbA1C of 7.4% (1.17), and 29.6% of these patients were using insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, patients with (vs. without) adequate glycaemic control had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower HbA1C levels (7.6 vs. 8.2%) at the time of adding an SU or a TZD to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, were less likely to report a history of macrovascular complications (20 vs. 26%) and were more often engaged in physical activity three to five times a week (29 vs. 23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one quarter of European out-patients with T2DM had adequate glycaemic control after a mean of 2.6 years following initiation of combination <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall glycaemic control modestly declined over time, even though more patients were being treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the progressive nature of the disease and need for more effective disease management/therapeutic alternatives </plain></SENT>
