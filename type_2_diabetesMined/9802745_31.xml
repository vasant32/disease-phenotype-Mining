<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known, however, whether after secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> failure, GLP-1 is still effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Therefore, 10 type 2 diabetic patients (6 women, 4 men; age 65+/-10 years, BMI 30.4+/-5.1 kg/m2, HbA1c 8.2+/-1.5%, 6+/-3 [2-13] years after starting insulin treatment) were examined in the fasting state after discontinuing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin on the evening before the two study days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 (1.2 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1) or placebo (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with 1% human serum albumin) were infused over 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidase) insulin (IMx), and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 9.4+/-0.5 mmol/l and was reduced by GLP-1 to 5.3+/-0.3 (3.9-7.3) mmol/l (placebo: 8.2+/-0.7 mmol/l; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 transiently increased insulin (from 115+/-31 to 222+/-64 pmol/l at 150 min; P &lt; 0.0001) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (from 1.00+/-0.12 to 1.90+/-0.23 nmol/l at 120 min; P &lt; 0.0001) with no effect of placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glucagon and free fatty acids were lowered transiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After normalization of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations became lower again during the ongoing administration of exogenous GLP-1, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that exogenous GLP-1 effectively lowers plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in advanced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> long after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> secondary failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may broaden the applicability of GLP-1-derived drugs as a new treatment to nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
