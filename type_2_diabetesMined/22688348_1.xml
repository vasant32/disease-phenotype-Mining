<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified individuals diagnosed with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Scotland between January 2005 and May 2008 using data from the national <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and ORs for risk factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at first screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 51,526 people with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> identified, 91.4% had been screened by 31 December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time to first screening was 315 days (interquartile range [IQR] 111-607 days), but by 2008 the median was 83 days (IQR 51-135 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence at first screening of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 19.3%, and for referable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> it was 1.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For individuals screened after a year the prevalence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 20.5% and referable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at screening was associated with male sex (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14, 1.25), HbA(1c) (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06, 1.08 per 1% [11 mmol/mol] increase), systolic BP (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05, 1.08 per 10 mmHg increase), time to screening (OR for screening &gt;1 year post diagnosis = 1.12, 95% CI 1.07, 1.17) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82, 0.93) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at first screening is lower than in previous UK studies, consistent with earlier diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in Scotland are screened within an acceptable interval and the prevalence of referable disease is low, even in those with delayed screening </plain></SENT>
