<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a retrospective analysis of claim data from the PharMetrics Patient-Centric Database that had over 1.12 million enrollees with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, &gt; or =18 years of age with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who had initiated treatment either with a thiazolidinedione (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were identified and matched on the basis of propensity scores, which served as a proxy for severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary measure of interest was the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> post-index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to unadjusted comparisons, Cox proportional hazard models were employed to estimate the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the 1- and 2-year incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (primary and secondary diagnoses) between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy group and the respective comparator groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazard models controlling for age, pre-index total healthcare costs, Charlson comorbidity index, procedures and a hospitalization or Emergency room (ER) visit for pre-index <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> were not associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other defined groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no primary or secondary diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> was reported in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of retrospective data analysis demonstrate no evidence of increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> for patients initiating therapy on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, compared to other oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy was not associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> at 2 years relative to other oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
