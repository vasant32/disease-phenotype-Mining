<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: eight randomized, clinical trials were identified from multiple databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Qualitative assessments and quantitative analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: in four T2DM studies (N = 930,duration of studies 16-52 weeks,120-150 mcg/dose BID-TID), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> studies (N = 686,duration of studies 6-24 weeks,120-360 mcg/dose BID-TID), equivalent volumes of placebo were administered before major meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pramlintide significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) (-0.33% [95% CI -0.51, -0.14], p = 0.004) and weight (-2.57 kg, [95% CI -3.44, -1.70], p &lt; 0.00001) versus the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More patients in the control group reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> of any severity versus the pramlintide group (risk ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.69, 10.3], p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In OBP, pramlintide caused a reduction in weight (-2.27 kg [95% CI -2.88, -1.66], p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When event data from both populations were combined, patients randomized to pramlintide were 1.8 times more likely to report <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> of any severity versus control (p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: pramlintide was associated with a small reduction in HbA1c, and a modest reduction in weight in patients with T2DM or OBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> at any time during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies about the long-term effect of pramlintide on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>- and cardiovascular-related complications and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed </plain></SENT>
