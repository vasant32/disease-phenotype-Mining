<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with the disease require treatment to achieve and maintain the target glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1C) level of 6.5%-7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological management of T2DM typically begins with the introduction of oral medications, and the majority of patients require exogenous insulin therapy at some point in time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary care physicians play an essential role in the management of T2DM since they often initiate insulin therapy and intensify regimens over time as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although insulin therapy is prescribed on an individualized basis, treatment usually begins with basal insulin added to a background therapy of oral agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prandial insulin injections may be added if glycemic targets are not achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatments may be intensified over time using patient-friendly titration algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The goal of insulin intensification within the primary care setting is to minimize patients' exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and reduce patients' risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, while achieving individualized fasting, postprandial, and A1C targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simplified treatment protocols and insulin delivery devices allow physicians to become efficient prescribers of insulin intensification within the primary care arena </plain></SENT>
