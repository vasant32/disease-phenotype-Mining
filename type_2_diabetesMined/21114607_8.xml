<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 16-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, four-arm, active control trial was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 929 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a mean (±s.d.) age of 53.3 ± 9.5 years, HbA₁(c) of 8.6 ± 1.0% and body weight of 68.1 ± 11.7 kg were randomized (liraglutide 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 mg once daily or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 4 mg once daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>: 1 : 1 : 1 : 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One subject withdrew immediately after randomization and before exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA₁(c) was significantly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg was non-inferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (mean HbA₁(c) reduction: 1.36% points, 1.45% points and 1.39% points, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was shown in the percentage of subjects reaching American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association HbA₁(c) target &lt;7% or American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists target ≤6.5% between liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide was associated with a 1.8-2.4 kg mean weight reduction, compared with a 0.1 kg mean <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide led to a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two subjects in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group reported major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> while none in the liraglutide groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide was associated with about 10-fold lower incidence of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> were the most common adverse events (AEs) for liraglutide, but were transient and resulted in few withdrawals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Asian subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, once-daily liraglutide led to improvement in glycaemic control similar to that with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> but with less frequent major and minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide also induced a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and reduced SBP and was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported AE was transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The effect of liraglutide in this Asian population is comparable to the effects seen in Caucasian, African American and Hispanic populations in global liraglutide phase 3 trials </plain></SENT>
