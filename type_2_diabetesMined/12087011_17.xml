<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, measured as BMI, and weight change to incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) among women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We followed 5,897 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Nurses' Health Study for &lt; or = 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women were aged 40-74 years and had no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at the beginning of the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMI values from three time points (age 18 years, year 1976, and current) were derived from the reported height (1976) and corresponding reported weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weight changes between age 18 years and 1976 and after diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women reported diagnoses of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHD every 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident CHD cases were confirmed by medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, we documented 418 incident cases of CHD (236 of nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and 182 of fatal CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, smoking, and other coronary risk factors, current BMI was strongly associated with increased risk of CHD among diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariate relative risks across increasing categories of BMI (&lt;23.0, 23.0-24.9, 25.0-26.9, 27.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and &gt; or = 35.0 kg/m(2)) were 1.0, 1.58, 1.85, 1.95, 2.80, and 3.21, respectively (P for trend &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing BMI values from age 18 years to 1976, before diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were also positively associated with risk of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> before the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was related to increased risk of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, weight change after diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not associated with risk of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide strong evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> before diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with future risk of CHD among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
