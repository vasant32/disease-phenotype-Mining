<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How these brain-imaging abnormalities evolve over time is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to quantify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and WMH progression over 4 years in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 55 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 28 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched control participants had two 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging scans with a 4-year interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volumetric measurements of total brain, peripheral cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lateral ventricles, and WMH were performed with k-nearest neighbor-based probabilistic segmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> volumes were expressed as percentage of intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses, adjusted for age and sex, were performed to compare brain volumes between the groups and to identify determinants of volumetric change within the type 2 diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a significantly smaller total brain volume and larger peripheral CSF volume than control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volumes showed a significant change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a greater increase in lateral ventricular volume than control participants (mean adjusted between-group difference in change over time [95% CI]: 0.11% in 4 years [0.00 to 0.22], P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The greater increase in lateral ventricular volume over time in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with control participants shows that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with a slow increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> over the course of years </plain></SENT>
