<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since these kinases have been shown to protect against myocardial injury, we hypothesized that GLP-1 could directly protect the heart against such injury via these prosurvival signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both isolated perfused rat heart and whole animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion were used, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size measured as the end point of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both studies, GLP-1 added before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> demonstrated a significant reduction in infarction compared with the valine pyrrolidide (an inhibitor of its breakdown) or saline groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This protection was abolished in the in vitro hearts by the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> exendin (9-39), the cAMP inhibitor Rp-cAMP, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50914">PI3kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> LY294002, and the p42/44 mitogen-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> UO126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated the phosphorylation of the proapoptotic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> BAD in the GLP-1-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show for the first time that GLP-1 protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in the isolated and intact rat heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This protection appears to involve activating multiple prosurvival kinases </plain></SENT>
