<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The prevalence and severity of orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was investigated in 277 Japanese male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including 90 hypertensive patients and 128 nondiabetic age-matched male subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OHT was defined as an increase in diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) from &lt;90 to &gt;or=90 mmHg and/or an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from &lt;140 to &gt;or=140 mmHg after standing from supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical profiles and several serum biochemical parameters were determined in addition to chest X-rays and electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of OHT in normotensive and hypertensive diabetic patients was significantly higher than in control subjects (12.8 vs. 1.8%, P &lt; 0.01, for normotensive patients; 12.6 vs. 11.1%, not significant, for hypertensive patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Orthostasis induced a mean increase of 6.8 +/- 11.4 mmHg in SBP and 9.1 +/- 5.2 mmHg in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> in diabetic patients with OHT compared with those without OHT (-1.0 +/- 9.0 and 3.8 +/- 6.6 mmHg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vibration sensation in the lower limb was reduced in diabetic patients with OHT, but the percent coefficient of variation of RR interval, cardio-to-thoracic ratio on chest X-ray, and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were higher in these patients compared with normotensive diabetic patients without OHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a novel complication in normotensive diabetic patients and may associate with early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and development of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
