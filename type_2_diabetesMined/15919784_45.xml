<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal plasma FFA concentration ( approximately 440 micromol/l) was increased to 695, 1,251, and 1,688 micromol/l after 4 h of Liposyn infusion and resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (R(d)) by 22, 30, and 34%, respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05 vs. saline control) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> infusion rate (90 ml/h) caused a further significant reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulin signaling events compared with the low-dose <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> infusion (P &lt; 0.05-0.01) whereas the 60-ml/h <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> infusion caused an intermediate reduction in insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, about two-thirds of the maximal inhibition of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal already occurred at the rather modest increase in plasma FFA induced by the low-dose (30-ml/h) <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of plasma FFA was already significant following a rather modest increase in plasma FFA and develops at concentrations that are well within the physiological range (i.e., at plasma FFA levels observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
