<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We established a case-cohort study including 11,994 incident type 2 diabetic case subjects and a stratified subcohort of 15,798 participants selected from a total cohort of 340,234 participants with 3.99 million person-years of follow-up, from eight European cohorts participating in the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative Mediterranean diet score (rMED) (score range 0-18) was used to assess adherence to MDP on the basis of reported consumption of nine dietary components characteristic of the Mediterranean diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression, modified for the case-cohort design, was used to estimate the association between rMED and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusting for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multiple adjusted hazard ratios of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among individuals with medium (rMED 7-10 points) and high adherence to MDP (rMED 11-18 points) were 0.93 (95% CI 0.86-1.01) and 0.88 (0.79-0.97), respectively, compared with individuals with low adherence to MDP (0-6 points) (P for trend 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between rMED and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was attenuated in people &lt;50 years of age, in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants, and when the alcohol, meat, and olive oil components were excluded from the score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, adherence to the MDP, as defined by rMED, was associated with a small reduction in the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this European population </plain></SENT>
