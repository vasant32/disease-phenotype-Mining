<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, conflicting results exist with regard to the role of TNF-alpha in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained blood and biopsy samples from skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 96) and healthy controls matched for age, sex and BMI (n = 103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had higher plasma levels of fasting insulin (p &lt; 0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.0001) compared with controls, but there was no difference between groups with regard to fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of TNF-alpha (p = 0.0009) and soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2; p = 0.002) were elevated in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was correlated with quartiles of plasma TNF-alpha after adjustment for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, WHR, neutrophils, IL-6 and maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> uptake (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi>/kg) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> content of adipose or muscle tissue did not differ between the groups, whereas muscle TNF-alpha protein content, evaluated by western blotting, was higher in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed more TNF-alpha protein in type 2 than in type 1 muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: After adjustment for multiple confounders, plasma TNF-alpha is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This supports the idea that TNF-alpha plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, findings on the TNF-alpha protein levels in plasma and skeletal muscle indicate that measurement of TNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> content in adipose or muscle tissue provides no information with regard to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
