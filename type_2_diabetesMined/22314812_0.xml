<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using linked data from registers of congenital anomaly and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 401,149 singleton pregnancies (1,677 in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) between 1996 and 2008 resulting in live birth, fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at ≥20 weeks' gestation or termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of non-chromosomal major congenital anomaly in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 71.6 per 1,000 pregnancies (95% CI 59.6, 84.9), a relative risk of 3.8 (95% CI 3.2, 4.5) compared with women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a three- to sixfold increased risk across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> common anomaly groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, peri-conception glycaemic control (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.3 [95% CI 1.2, 1.4] per 1% [11 mmol/mol] linear increase in HbA(1c) above 6.3% [45 mmol/mol]) and pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (aOR 2.5 [95% CI 1.1, 5.3]) were significant independent predictors of congenital anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations with gestation at booking (aOR 1.1 [95% CI 1.0, 1.1]) and parity (aOR 1.6 [95% CI 1.0, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5]) were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unadjusted risk was higher for women from deprived areas or who did not take <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Type and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ethnicity, age, BMI, preconception care, smoking and fetal sex were not associated with congenital anomaly risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peri-conception glycaemia is the most important modifiable risk factor for congenital anomaly in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> merits further study </plain></SENT>
