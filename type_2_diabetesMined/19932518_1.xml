<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : NT-proBNP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels were measured 31 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to echocardiographic data, diabetic patients were divided into two groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV function or LV diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Serum NT-proBNP levels in diabetic patients with LVDD were significantly higher than in diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV function and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for NT-proBNP to separate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vs. diastolic dysfunction was 0.96 in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in both diabetic groups than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive correlation was noted between NT-proBNP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels in diabetic patients with LVDD (r=0.881, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : The correlation between elevated NT-proBNP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels in diabetic patients with LVDD suggest an association between homocysteinemia and increased NT-proBNP secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that NT-proBNP may be a simple screening tool to select diabetic patients with LVDD requiring further examination with echocardiography </plain></SENT>
