<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 18-week trial, 530 patients with HbA(1c) &gt;or=7.5% and &lt;or=11.0% (mean baseline 8.7%) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100mg once daily or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> significantly (p&lt;0.001) reduced mean HbA(1c) (-1.0%), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.7 mmol/L), and 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-3.1 mmol/L), and a significantly (p&lt;0.001) greater proportion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>-treated versus placebo-treated patients achieved HbA(1c) &lt;7% (20.6% versus 5.3%, respectively) at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was demonstrated in each country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> was generally well-tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical adverse events (AEs) were reported in 23.3% and 15.2% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference was primarily due to increased gastrointestinal AEs in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group, most of which were mild and resolved on study drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serious AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and drug-related AEs occurred with a low incidence in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> monotherapy for 18 weeks significantly improved glycemic control and was well-tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from China, India, and Korea </plain></SENT>
