<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To clarify the association between serum <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred seventy nine patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were consecutively enrolled and metabolic parameters were checked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-grade NAFLD was defined as moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease, measured using liver ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SHBG, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SHBG levels were lower in patients with high-grade NAFLD than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrasound and decreased significantly based on the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SHBG levels were negatively correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, high-grade NAFLD, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT), homeostasis model assessment-estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) and were positively correlated with <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (ORs) predicting the presence of high-grade NAFLD in men and women decreased significantly with increasing SHBG tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ORs remained significant even after further adjusting for BMI, waist circumference, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, γGT, ALT, CRP, HOMA-IR, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, and anti-diabetic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum SHBG levels were independently associated with the high-grade NAFLD in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
