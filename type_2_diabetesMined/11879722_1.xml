<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E polymorphism in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their impact on plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects: Unrelated Type 2 diabetic patients (n = 298) treated by diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and not receiving <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering regimens, elderly (n = 98) and young (n = 101)unrelated healthy control subjects in Hungary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotypes were identified by PCR amplification and subsequent restriction endonuclease digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of the most frequent genotypes in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group was E2/3 8.7%, E3/3 78.2%, E3/4 12.8%, in the elderly group E2/3 9.2%, E3/3 78.6%, E3/4 12.2% and in the young group E2/3 11.9%, E3/3 62.4%, E3/4 24.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of allele e4 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in the elderly control group were significantly lower than in the young control group (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations were found between the e4 allele and <z:mp ids='MP_0005317'>increased triglyceride level</z:mp> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group, the e2 allele and decreased total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels both in the elderly and young control groups (both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lower frequency of allele e4 in both the elderly and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups, may be explained by an increased morbidity and mortality in middle-aged carriers of apo e4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased risk of e4 carriers in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be partly mediated by a higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
