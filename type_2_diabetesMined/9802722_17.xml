<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between use of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy(HRT) and subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 623 postmenopausal women in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current users of HRT, n = 200, were compared with 104 former users and 319 never users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intimal-medial wall thicknesses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMTs</z:e>) of the common carotid (CCA) and internal carotid (ICA) arteries were used as measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences between HRT user groups were noted for certain demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for these and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk factors, current users had a 69 microm thinner ICA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> than never users (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Former users had a 96 pm thinner ICA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> than never users (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed for the CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had thicker carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> than women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the association between HRT use and thinner <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference between current and never users was attenuated by adjustment for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither duration of HRT use nor HRT regimen was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in either artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that current and former use of HRT is associated with reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and that women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may receive the same benefit from HRI as women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
