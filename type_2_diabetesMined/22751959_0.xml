<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine how much physical activity (PA) is needed to protect against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in older adults, whether protection is greater among overweight individuals, and whether taking up moderate activity in later life is beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Men (4,252) from a U.K. population-based cohort self-reported usual PA (regular walking and cycling, recreational activity, and sport) in 1996 and in 1998-2000, alongside other health behaviors and medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 7.1 years, during which 135 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (validated self-report) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 3,012 men free from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1998-2000, 9% reported no usual leisure-time PA, 23% occasional PA, and 15% vigorous PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with men reporting no activity, men reporting occasional, light, moderate, moderately vigorous, and vigorous PA had lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risks: hazard ratio (HR) 0.58 (95% CI 0.33-1.02), 0.39 (0.20-0.74), 0.38 (0.19-0.73), 0.39 (0.20-0.77), and 0.33 (0.16-0.70), respectively; P (trend) = 0.002, adjusted for age, social class, tobacco, alcohol, diet, and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for BMI, waist circumference, or fasting insulin attenuated HRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HRs were stronger in men with BMI â‰¥28 vs. &lt;28 kg/m(2) (interaction P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with men reporting light activity or less in 1996 and 2000, men who became at least moderately active by 2000 or remained at least moderately active at both times had adjusted HRs of 0.62 (0.34-1.12) and 0.51 (0.31-0.82), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even light PA markedly reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in older men, especially among the overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taking up or maintaining at least moderate PA in older adulthood strongly protected against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
