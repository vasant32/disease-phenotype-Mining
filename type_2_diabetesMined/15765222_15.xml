<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the prevalence of autoantibodies to protein tyrosine phosphatase isoforms IA-2 (IA-2A) and IA-2beta/phogrin (IA-2betaA) in a cohort of adult UKPDS patients thought to have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and investigated the possible role of these autoantibodies in predicting requirement for insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IA-2A and IA-2betaA were measured by a validated radioimmunoassay with human recombinant autoantigens in 4,169 white Caucasian patients aged 25-65 years and newly diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical requirement for insulin therapy within 6 years was examined in 2,556 patients not randomised to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IA-2A and IA-2betaA were present in 2.2 and 1.4%, respectively, of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IA-2A were more prevalent in younger patients (p for trend &lt;0.00001), more often associated with the HLA-DR4 allele (26.3 vs 8.0%, p&lt;0.0001), and their presence increased the likelihood of insulin therapy requirement within 6 years from diagnosis [relative risk (95%CI) 12.2 (9.8-15.3)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of IA-2A together with GADA increased the relative risk of requiring insulin therapy from 5.4 (4.1-7.1) for GADA alone to 8.3 (3.7-18.8) and the corresponding positive predictive value from 33 to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the presence of IA-2A is infrequent, associated with the HLA-DR4 haplotype, and highly predictive of future need for insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The measurement of IA-2betaA does not provide additional information </plain></SENT>
