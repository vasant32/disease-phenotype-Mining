<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The insulin-signaling network regulates blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, controls metabolism, and when dysregulated, may lead to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in this network is clear, only a limited number of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue and establish temporal response, we have, for the first time, carried out an extensive, quantitative, mass spectrometry-based analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was performed with 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated with insulin for 0, 5, 15, and 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has resulted in the identification and relative temporal quantification of 122 tyrosine phosphorylation sites on 89 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment caused a change of at least 1.3-fold in tyrosine phosphorylation on 89 of these sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the responsive sites, 20 were previously known to be tyrosine phosphorylated with insulin treatment, including sites on the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 69 responsive sites have not previously been shown to be altered by insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were on proteins with a wide variety of functions, including components of the trafficking machinery for the insulin-responsive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter GLUT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that insulin-elicited tyrosine phosphorylation is extensive and implicate a number of hitherto unrecognized proteins in insulin action </plain></SENT>
