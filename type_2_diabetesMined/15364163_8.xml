<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To address the possibility that the partial disruption of Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) signaling could cause <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we tried to detect the mutation in GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) gene in the population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from 36 unrelated Japanese type 2 diabetic subjects and directly sequenced for the GLP-1R gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the detected polymorphisms, 791 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 318 controls were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism and association study was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five missense and four silent variants were detected in the GLP-1R gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the frequencies of Pro7Leu, Arg44His and Leu260Pro polymorphism between the diabetic and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And also there were no significant differences in body mass index (BMI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age and fasting IRI among the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, heterozygote and homozygote of these variants in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thr149Met mutation was detected in one case among 791 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, but not in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient with this mutation exhibited impairment of both insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness, which may be partially explained by Thr149Met mutation in GLP-1R, though family linkage analysis and function analysis remain to be examined </plain></SENT>
