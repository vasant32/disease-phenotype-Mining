<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that glycemic control would be worse among black than white diabetic individuals but that this association would be explained by differences in severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, health status, health care indicators, and social, psychological, or behavioral factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further hypothesized that the association of race with poorer glycemic control would be limited to those with lower education or lower income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 468 diabetic participants among a cohort of 3,075 nondisabled blacks and whites aged 70-79 years living in the community enrolled in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was measured by the level of HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 58.5% of the diabetic individuals were black </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although control was poor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic participants (HbA(1c) &gt; or =7% in 73.7%), blacks had worse glycemic control than whites (age- and sex-adjusted mean HbA(1c), 8.4% in blacks and 7.4% in whites; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Race differences in glycemic control remained significant, even after adjusting for current insulin therapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, higher total cholesterol, and not receiving a flu shot in the previous year, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were associated with higher HbA(1c) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Controlling for these factors reduced the association by 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Race remained an important factor in glycemic control, even when results were stratified by education or income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HbA(1c) concentrations were higher in older black diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Differences in glycemic control by race were associated with disease severity, health status, and poorer quality of care, but these factors did not fully explain the higher HbA(1c) levels in older black diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
