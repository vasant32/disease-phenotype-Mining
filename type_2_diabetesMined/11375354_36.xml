<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified eight novel polymorphisms, of which the -1420 (GGT)n, -1393 G/T, -1390 G/T, and -1202 G/A were in the overlapping PBX2 3' untranslated region (UTR), and the -429 T/C (66.5% TT, 33.5% TC/CC), -407 to -345 deletion (99% I, 1% I/D, 0% D), -374 T/A (66.4% TT, 33.6% TA/AA), and +20 T/A were in the RAGE promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effects on transcriptional activity, we measured <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> transferase (CAT) reporter gene expression, driven by variants of the -738 to +49 RAGE gene fragment containing the four polymorphisms identified close to the transcriptional start site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The -429 C, -374 A, and 63-bp deletion alleles resulted in a mean increase of CAT expression of twofold (P &lt; 0.0001), threefold (P &lt; 0.001), and fourfold (P &lt; 0.05), respectively, with the -374 T and A alleles yielding highly differential binding of nuclear protein extract from both monocyte- and hepatocyte-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the functional polymorphisms were investigated in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (106 with and 109 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>), with the -429 C allele showing an increase in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the polymorphisms involved in differences in RAGE gene regulation may influence the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic vascular complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
