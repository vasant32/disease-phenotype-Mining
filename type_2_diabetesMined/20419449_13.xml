<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the impact of these variants on insulin release and insulin sensitivity estimated from OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven variants in or near DGKB/TMEM195, ADCY5, MADD, ADRA2A, FADS1, CRY2, SLC2A2, GLIS3, PROX1, C2CD4B and IGF1 were genotyped in 6,784 middle-aged participants of the population-based Inter99 cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association studies of quantitative estimates of insulin release and insulin sensitivity were performed in 5,722 non-diabetic Danish participants on whom an OGTT was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Assuming an additive genetic model, carriers of the alleles increasing fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in DGKB/TMEM195, ADRA2A, GLIS3 and C2CD4B showed decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release as assessed by the BIGTT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response index (2.7-3.5%; p &lt; 0.005 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) and by corrected insulin response (2.8-5.9%; p &lt; 0.03 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the PROX1 <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-raising allele showed a 2.9% decreased corrected insulin response (p = 0.03), while the hyperglycaemic allele of variants in or near ADRA2A, FADS1, CRY2 and C2CD4B were associated with a 2.6% to 9.3% decrease in one or both of two different OGTT-based disposition indices (p &lt; 0.02 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After correction for multiple testing, variants in the DGKB/TMEM195, ADRA2A, GLIS3 and C2CD4B loci were associated with estimates of beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We found that the lead variants at the DGKB/TMEM195, ADRA2A, GLIS3 and C2CD4B loci were associated with decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association underlines the importance of pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the genetic predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
