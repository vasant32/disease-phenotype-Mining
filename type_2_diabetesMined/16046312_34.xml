<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of chemical ablation of GIP receptor (GIP-R) action on aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a stable and specific GIP-R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, (Pro3)GIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Young adult ob/ob mice received once-daily intraperitoneal injections of saline vehicle or (Pro3)GIP over an 11-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonfasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and the overall glycemic excursion (area under the curve) to a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load were significantly reduced (1.6-fold; P &lt; 0.05) in (Pro3)GIP-treated mice compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GIP-R ablation also significantly lowered overall plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (1.4-fold; P &lt; 0.05) and insulin (1.5-fold; P &lt; 0.05) responses to feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with significantly enhanced (1.6-fold; P &lt; 0.05) insulin sensitivity in the (Pro3)GIP-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Daily injection of (Pro3)GIP reduced pancreatic insulin content (1.3-fold; P &lt; 0.05) and partially corrected the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related islet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These comprehensive beneficial effects of (Pro3)GIP were reversed 9 days after cessation of treatment and were independent of food intake and body weight, which were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies highlight a role for GIP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and emphasize the potential of specific GIP-R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> as a new class of drugs for the alleviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
