<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive capacity of a recently described equation that we have termed CUN-BAE (Clínica Universidad de Navarra-Body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Adiposity</z:e> Estimator) based on BMI, sex, and age for estimating body fat percentage (BF%) and to study its clinical usefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a comparison study of the developed equation with many other anthropometric indices regarding its correlation with actual BF% in a large cohort of 6,510 white subjects from both sexes (67% female) representing a wide range of ages (18-80 years) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a validation study in a separate cohort (n = 1,149) and a further analysis of the clinical usefulness of this prediction equation regarding its association with cardiometabolic risk factors (n = 634) was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean BF% in the cohort of 6,510 subjects determined by air displacement plethysmography was 39.9 ± 10.1%, and the mean BF% estimated by the CUN-BAE was 39.3 ± 8.9% (SE of the estimate, 4.66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this group, BF% calculated with the CUN-BAE showed the highest correlation with actual BF% (r = 0.89, P &lt; 0.000001) compared with other anthropometric measures or BF% estimators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar agreement was found in the validation sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BF% estimated by the CUN-BAE exhibits, in general, better correlations with cardiometabolic risk factors than BMI as well as waist circumference in the subset of 634 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CUN-BAE is an easy-to-apply predictive equation that may be used as a first screening tool in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our equation may be a good tool for identifying patients at cardiovascular and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
