<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in hospitalized patients is known to be related to a higher incidence of clinical and surgical complications and poorer outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adequate glycemic control and earlier diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during hospitalization are cost-effective measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective cohort study was designed to determine the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on morbidity and mortality in a general hospital setting during a 3-month period by reviewing patients' records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary purposes of this trial were to verify that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed properly and sufficiently early and that it was managed during the hospital stay; we also aimed to evaluate the relationship between in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> control and outcomes such as complications during the hospital stay, extent of hospitalization, frequency of re-hospitalization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates and number of days in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses utilized the Kruskall-Wallis complemented by the "a posteriori" d.m.s. test, Spearman correlation and Chi-squared test, with a level of significance of 5% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We reviewed 779 patient records that fulfilled inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 5 groups: group (1) diabetic with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycemic levels according to American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria for in-hospital patients (n = 123); group (2) diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (n = 76); group (3) non-diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (n = 225); group (4)diabetics and non-diabetics with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> during 3 consecutive days (n = 57) and group (5) those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (n = 298) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients in groups 1 and 5, patients in groups 2, 3 and 4 had significantly higher mortality rates (17.7% vs. 2.8%) and Intensive Care Unit admissions with complications (23.3% vs. 4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 4 had the longest hospitalizations (mean 15.5 days), and group 5 had the lowest re-hospitalization rate (mean of 1.28 hospitalizations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 184 (51.4%) hyperglycemic patients had received treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An insulin "sliding-scale" alone was the most frequent treatment used, and there was a wide variation in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> target medical prescriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intra Venous insulin infusion was used in 3.8% of patients in the ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Glycohemoglobin(A1C) was measured in 11 patients(2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was correlated with, among other parameters, morbidity/mortality, length of hospitalization and number of re-hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most patients did not have their glycemic levels measured at the hospital; despite the high number of hyperglycemic patients not diagnosed as diabetics, A1C was not frequently measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Even when patients are assessed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, they were not treated properly </plain></SENT>
