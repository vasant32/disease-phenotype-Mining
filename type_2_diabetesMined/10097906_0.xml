<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary source of understanding of pathways to nerve damage come from animal studies, despite the fears that the model in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in no way reflects the human situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic hope at the moment from such animal work must focus on the interference of pathways known to lead to neural blood-flow abnormalities and a variety of <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp>, as well as the possibility that addition of nerve growth factor will assist repair and regeneration </plain></SENT>
