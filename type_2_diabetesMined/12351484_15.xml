<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, it has been shown that subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a lower frequency of NKT cells than nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured the frequency of peripheral Valpha24(+) Vbeta11(+) T-cells, which include human NKT cells, in Japanese diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 164 Japanese diabetic patients and 67 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients were classified into four categories as follows: islet-associated autoantibody-positive (Ab(+)) and -negative (Ab(-)) classic type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured the frequency of peripheral Valpha24(+) Vbeta11(+) CD3(+) triple-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unexpectedly, a higher frequency of Valpha24(+) Vbeta11(+) T-cells was observed in Ab(+) and Ab(-) patients compared with LADA patients (P = 0.0294 and P = 0.0021), type 2 diabetic patients (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.0001), and healthy subjects (P = 0.0046 and P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an inverse correlation between Valpha24(+) Vbeta11(+) T-cell frequency and disease duration was observed in Ab(+) (rho = -0.455; P = 0.0023) and Ab(-) (rho = -0.432; P = 0.0162) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that a high frequency of Valpha24(+) Vbeta11(+) T-cells is a unique finding in recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> classic type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and measurement of Valpha24(+) Vbeta11(+) T-cell frequency may be useful to assess the disease activity of classic type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
