<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Health care professionals encourage patients to consult nutritional labels as one strategy to assess and restrict caloric intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among subjects enrolled in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> clinical trial, the objective is to determine the accuracy of subjects' estimates of caloric deficit needed to achieve the desired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 6-month controlled trial demonstrated efficacy of a portion control tool to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in 130 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had previously received dietary teaching from a dietician and a nurse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline, patients were asked how much weight they would like to lose and to quantitatively estimate the caloric deficit required to achieve this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stated amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> desired ranged from 4.5 to 73 kg, with an average of 26.6 kg (n = 127 respondents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 30% of participants were willing to estimate the required caloric deficit to lose their target weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects' per kilograms estimate of caloric deficit required ranged from 0.7 to 2,000,000 calories/kg with a median of 86 calories/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of subjects (47.4%) underestimated the total required caloric deficit to achieve their target <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> by greater than 100,000 calories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite attendance at a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education centre, this population of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals had a poor understanding of the quantitative relationship between caloric deficit and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Educational initiatives focused upon quantitative caloric intake and its impact on weight change may be needed to assist <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients in setting appropriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> goals and achieving the appropriate daily caloric restriction required for success </plain></SENT>
