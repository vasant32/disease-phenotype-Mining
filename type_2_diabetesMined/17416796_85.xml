<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> the impaired levels and effect of incretins changed as a consequence of RY-GBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Incretin (gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> [GIP] and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 [GLP-1]) levels and their effect on insulin secretion were measured before and 1 month after RY-GBP in eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in seven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incretin effect was measured as the difference in insulin secretion (area under the curve [AUC]) in response to an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and to an isoglycemic intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting and stimulated levels of GLP-1 and GIP were not different between control subjects and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One month after RY-GBP, body weight decreased by 9.2 +/- 7.0 kg, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated GLP-1 (AUC) and GIP peak levels increased significantly by 24.3 +/- 7.9 pmol x l(-1) x min(-1) (P &lt; 0.0001) and 131 +/- 85 pg/ml (P = 0.007), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blunted incretin effect markedly increased from 7.6 +/- 28.7 to 42.5 +/- 11.3 (P = 0.005) after RY-GBP, at which it time was not different from that for the control subjects (53.6 +/- 23.5%, P = 0.284) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that early after RY-GBP, greater GLP-1 and GIP release could be a potential mediator of improved insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
