<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates per 1000 person-years were 31.35 for males and 21.99 for females, and the ratios of observed to expected number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were 1.69 for males and 1.74 for females, indicating an excess mortality for diabetic patients of both sexes and higher mortality in males than in females in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors related to the prognosis of the patients were age, elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> at entry to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment was also associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebro-cardiovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> were the major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in diabetic patients; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> killed 19.5%, cerebrovascular disease 16.7% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> 13.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relatively high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially in patients with a lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, was noteworthy, suggesting some difference in the clinical manifestations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between Japan and Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> accounted for 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> of the liver for 6.4% </plain></SENT>
