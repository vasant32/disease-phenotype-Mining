<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on GLUT4 immunoreactivity in slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a newly developed, very sensitive method using immunohistochemistry combined with morphometry, GLUT4 density was found to be significantly higher in slow compared with fast fibers in biopsy specimens from lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in type 2 diabetic subjects, GLUT4 density was significantly lower in slow compared with fast fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GLUT4 density in slow fibers from diabetic patients was reduced by 9% compared with the weight-matched <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects and by 18% compared with the lean control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The slow-fiber fraction was reduced to 86% in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects and to 75% in the diabetic subjects compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimated GLUT4 contribution from slow fibers was reduced to 77% in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects and to 61% in type 2 diabetic patients compared with the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that a reduction in the fraction of slow-twitch fibers, combined with a reduction in GLUT4 expression in slow fibers, may reduce the insulin-sensitive GLUT4 pool in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and thus contribute to skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
