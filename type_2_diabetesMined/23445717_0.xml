<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although incretin therapy is clinically available in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> undergoing hemodialysis, no study has yet examined whether incretin therapy is capable of maintaining glycemic control in this group of patients when switched from insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the efficacy of incretin therapy in patients with insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> undergoing hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten type 2 diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis received daily 0.3 mg liraglutide, 50 mg vildagliptin, and 6.25 mg alogliptin switched from insulin therapy on both the day of hemodialysis and the non-hemodialysis day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was monitored by continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control by insulin, patients were treated with three types of incretin therapy in a randomized crossover manner, with continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring performed for each treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During treatment with incretin therapies, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> were not observed in any patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximum blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on the day of hemodialysis were significantly lower after treatment with liraglutide compared with treatment with alogliptin (p &lt; 0.05), but not with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standard deviation value, a marker of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuation, on the non-hemodialysis day was significantly lower after treatment with liraglutide compared with treatment with insulin and alogliptin (p &lt; 0.05), but not with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was significantly shorter after treatment with liraglutide on both the hemodialysis and non-hemodialysis days compared with treatment with alogliptin (p &lt; 0.05), but not with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here suggest that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> undergoing hemodialysis and insulin therapy could be treated with incretin therapy in some cases </plain></SENT>
