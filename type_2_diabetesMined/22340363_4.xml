<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess effect of linagliptin on glycaemic control, biomarkers and incidence of adverse events (AEs) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five published and four unpublished randomized, clinical trials were identified from multiple databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitative assessments and quantitative analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine studies included 4246 participants with 53% men, 59.4% Caucasians, 38.7% Asians, and age range 45-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin was given as monotherapy (vs. placebo) or combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> + placebo), sulphonylurea (vs. sulphonylurea + placebo) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> + placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin 5 mg/day for 12-24 weeks, significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) (-0.63%, p &lt; 0.00001), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) (-1.01 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.00001) and improved disposition index (DI, product of insulin sensitivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretion) (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin monotherapy was not more effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> at reducing HbA1c or FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar proportion of patients in linagliptin and placebo groups reported AEs including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002788'>upper respiratory tract infections</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Linagliptin was associated with modest but significant reduction in HbA1c and FPG and improved DI after 12-24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who would probably benefit most are those with HbA1c &lt;9%, already on an active agent, compliant with weight reduction strategies, and can recognize and manage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, fluid retention and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002788'>upper respiratory tract infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term studies are needed to determine durability of response, incidence of microvascular and macrovacular complications, cost-effectiveness and safety </plain></SENT>
