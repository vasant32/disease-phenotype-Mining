<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Friedreich's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> is associated with GAA trinucleotide repeat expansions in the frataxin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the general population, these trinucleotide expansions are variable in length, and three types of expansions are seen: short, intermediate, and long repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Friedreich's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> patients are generally homozygous for the long repeats and exhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as pronounced comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ristow et al. recently reported an association between the intermediate-length <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele in the frataxin gene and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have investigated in 94 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) as to whether the length of the GAA trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the frataxin gene associates with parameters reflecting beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A hyperglycemic clamp at 10 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for 3 h was used to quantitate beta-cell characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carriers of one or two intermediate repeat alleles (n = 32) had a 50% higher median first- phase insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than the noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they needed less time to reach peak insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the distribution of the various repeat lengths in elderly type 2 diabetic (n = 179) and control subjects (n = 183), with the same age and ethnic background, did not provide evidence for an association of the intermediate-length repeat allele with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Dutch Caucasians </plain></SENT>
