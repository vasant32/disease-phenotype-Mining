<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Despite the clinical importance of an accurate diagnosis in individuals with monogenic forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, restricted access to genetic testing leaves many patients with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, common variation near the HNF1 homeobox A (HNF1A) gene was shown to influence C-reactive protein levels in healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) could represent a clinically useful biomarker for the identification of HNF1A mutations causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum hs-CRP was measured in subjects with HNF1A-MODY (n = 31), autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 316), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 240), and glucokinase (GCK) MODY (n = 24) and in nondiabetic individuals (n = 198) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The discriminative accuracy of hs-CRP was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and performance was compared with standard diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our primary analyses excluded approximately 11% of subjects in whom the single available hs-CRP measurement was &gt;10 mg/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Geometric mean (SD range) hs-CRP levels were significantly lower (P &lt;or= 0.009) for HNF1A-MODY individuals, 0.20 (0.03-1.14) mg/l, than for any other group: autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 0.58 (0.10-2.75) mg/l, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 1.33 (0.28-6.14) mg/l, GCK-MODY 1.01 (0.19-5.33) mg/l, and nondiabetic 0.48 (0.10-2.42) mg/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ROC-derived C-statistic for discriminating HNF1A-MODY and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of hs-CRP, either alone or in combination with current diagnostic criteria, was superior to current diagnostic criteria alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity for the combined criteria approached 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum hs-CRP levels are markedly lower in HNF1A-MODY than in other forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>hs-CRP has potential as a widely available, cost-effective screening test to support more precise targeting of MODY diagnostic testing </plain></SENT>
