<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A longitudinal population-based study was performed with surveys in 1987 and 1992 on the island of Mauritius, assessing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status by the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,717 subjects took part in both surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these subjects, 3,229 were not diabetic in 1987 and formed the basis of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, there were 607 subjects with IGT and 266 subjects with IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 297 subjects who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For predicting progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were 26, 94, and 29% for IFG and 50, 84, and 24% for IGT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 26% of subjects that progressed to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were predicted by their IFG values, but a further 35% could be identified by also considering IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivities were 24% for IFG and 37% for IGT in men and 26% for IFG and 66% for IGT in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the higher sensitivity of IGT over IFG for predicting progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Screening by the criteria for IFG alone would identify fewer people who subsequently progress to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than would the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
