<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess racial differences in risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> among individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, after taking into account differences in the distribution of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The participants were 105 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 40-69 years, who had no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at the time of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic eye disease</z:e> screening project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After an average of 4 years of follow-up, the subjects were reevaluated using nonmydriatic funds photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> occurred more often among black than white participants (50 vs. 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference could not be explained by differences in risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or potential confounders (odds ratio [95% CI] 2.96 [1.00-8.78] after adjustment for level of glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, systolic blood pressure, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment, and sex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the concept that racial differences in risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> exist among individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that these differences may be caused by differential (genetic) susceptibility to the adverse effects of increased levels of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and/or blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discovery of the etiology of this differential susceptibility would allows us to identify and target secondary prevention efforts to individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
