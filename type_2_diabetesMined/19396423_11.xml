<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle-aged patients (n = 414) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent clinic and ambulatory BP measurements and applanation tonometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MNHT (clinic BP &lt; 130/80 mmHg and night-time BP &gt; or = 120/70 mmHg) was found in 7.2% of patients (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with both clinical and nocturnal normotension (n = 70), patients with MNHT had higher aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (10.2 +/- 1.8 m/s vs 9.4 +/- 1.7 m/s; p = 0.03) and higher central BP (117.6 +/- 13.9/74.0 +/- 9.1 mmHg vs 110.4 +/- 16.4/69.7 +/- 9.6 mmHg, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with clinical normotension, night-time systolic BP correlated significantly with PWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Thirty per cent of patients with clinical normotension had nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by increased arterial stiffness and higher central BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in clinically normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ambulatory BP measurement may help clinicians to identify patients with increased cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
