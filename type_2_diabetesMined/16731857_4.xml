<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present data from a genome-wide scan identifying genetic factors conferring susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The linkage analysis was based on 59 families from northern Sweden, consisting of a total of 129 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 19 individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Model-free linkage analysis revealed a maximum multipoint logarithm of odds score of 3.19 for D2S2987 at 267.7 cM (P=0.00058), suggesting that a gene conferring susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the northern Swedish population resides in the 2q37 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data replicate, in a European population, previously identified linkage of marker loci in this region to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no evidence in support of association to the previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the calpain-10 gene was observed in a case-control cohort derived from the same population </plain></SENT>
