<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 6,445 Hong Kong Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at enrollment were followed up for a median of 5.37 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spline Cox proportional hazard regression was used to obtain hazard ratio curves, which were used to identify cutoff points of A1C and spot urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio for increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The identified cutoff point of A1C was used to check biological interaction between A1C and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (micro- and macroalbuminuria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biological interaction was estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and synergy index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 4.45% (n = 287) of patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A1C was associated with increased hazard ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in a near-linear manner except for two points-6.2 and 8.0%-where the slope between these two points accelerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For A1C values &lt;6.2%, the presence of micro/macroalbuminuria did not confer additional risk, while significant biological interaction between A1C and micro/macroalbuminuria for values &gt;or=6.2% was observed (RERI 0.92, 95% CI 0.16-1.68, and AP 0.40, 0.01-0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A1C &gt;or=6.2% and micro/macroalbuminuria interact to markedly increase the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> risk, which explains a large proportion of risk in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> harboring both risk factors </plain></SENT>
