<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vitreous and serum samples were collected during vitrectomy from 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> and 15 patients who underwent vitrectomy for other reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tests were performed using the ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum and intraocular concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, vWF were considerably higher in the subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the vitreous, the increase in vWF depended on the elevated levels of vWF in the serum (r=0.905, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E-selectin correlated with diastolic blood pressure (r=0.506, p=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of vWF and E-selectin in both samples were related to the significant increases in intraocular ICAM-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 in the serum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased VCAM-1 level in the vitreous correlated with the concentration of HbA(1)c (r=0.59, p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Upon local and systemic damage to the endothelium there were significant increases in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation of VCAM-1 increase in the vitreous with HbA(1)c is an important argument for the influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on immuno-inflammatory activation in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microcirculation </plain></SENT>
