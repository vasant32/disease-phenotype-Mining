<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cluster sampling of 4,923 subjects &gt;/=20 years old in a rural community were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure, height, weight, and girth of waist and hip were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The crude prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 4.3% and IFG was 12.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (95% CI) was 3.8% (3.12-4.49) and IFG was 13.0% (11.76-14.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subjects with higher family income had significantly higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (5.9 vs. 3.5%, P &lt; 0.001) and IFG (15.6 vs. 10.8%, P &lt; 0.001) than those with lower income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Employing logistic regression in different models, we found that wealthy class, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, reduced physical exercise, and increased age, BMI, and WHR were the important predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> showed no association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG in the rural population was found to be on the increase compared with the previous reports of Bangladesh and other Asian studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Older age, higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, higher income, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and reduced physical activity were proved significant risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG, whereas plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> showed no association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further study may address whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is causally associated with insulin deficiency or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
