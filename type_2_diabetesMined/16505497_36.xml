<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi>, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> and glipizide, an insulin secretagogue, are commonly used to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study was designed to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> versus glipizide on body water, body composition, and hemodynamic parameters in the presence of comparable glycemic control between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 19 diabetic subjects randomly assigned to either 45 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 8) or 10 mg (median dose) glipizide (n = 11) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body water content was measured with deuterated water, body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography, and cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance by <z:chebi fb="18" ids="27518">acetylene</z:chebi> rebreathing technique both before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> increased (P &lt; 0.001 from baseline) total body water (+2.4 +/- 0.5 l) accounting for 75% of the total <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (+3.1 +/- 2.0 kg) but did not alter vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total abdominal (-32.2 +/- 19 cm(2)) and visceral fat area (-16.1 +/- 8 cm(2)) tended to decrease with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> but increased (P &lt; 0.02 for differences between groups) with glipizide (+38.4 +/- 17 cm(2) abdominal; +19.1 +/- 9 cm(2) visceral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> tended to reduce (P = 0.05) diastolic (-8.4 +/- 4 mmHg) and mean (-9.5 +/- 5 mmHg; P = 0.08) blood pressure and reduced (P &lt; 0.001) systemic vascular resistance (2,785 +/- 336 vs. 2,227 +/- 136 dynes/s per m(2)), while there were no differences in these parameters with glipizide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither therapy altered circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and glipizide are given in doses sufficient to achieve equivalent glycemic control in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> increases total body water, thereby accounting for the majority of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, tended to decrease visceral and abdominal fat content and blood pressure, and reduces systemic vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
