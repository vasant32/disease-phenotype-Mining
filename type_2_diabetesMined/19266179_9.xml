<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study including 7,170 women with diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coffee consumption was assessed in 1980 and then every 2-4 years using validated questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 658 incident cardiovascular events (434 coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and 224 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and 734 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes were documented between 1980 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, smoking and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the relative risks were 0.76 (95% CI 0.50-1.14) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (p trend = 0.09) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.55-1.14) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (p trend = 0.05) for the consumption of &gt;or=4 cups/day of caffeinated coffee compared with non-drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, multivariable RRs were 0.96 (95% CI 0.66-1.38) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (p trend = 0.84) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.54-1.07) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (p trend = 0.08) for the consumption of &gt;or=2 cups/day of decaffeinated coffee compared with non-drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher decaffeinated coffee consumption was associated with lower concentrations of HbA(1c) (6.2% for &gt;or=2 cups/day versus 6.7% for &lt;1 cup/month; p trend = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that habitual coffee consumption is not associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> or premature mortality among diabetic women </plain></SENT>
