<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the association between global DNA methylation and IR using 84 monozygotic twin pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IR was estimated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Global DNA methylation of Alu repeats in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between global DNA methylation and IR was examined using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and within-twin pair analyses, adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results show that methylation levels at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four CpG sites were individually associated with IR by GEE (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> false discovery rate-adjusted P valuesâ‰¤0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 10% increase in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.55 units (95% CI 2.38-6.73) in HOMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intrapair difference in IR was significantly associated with intrapair difference in global methylation level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 10% increase in the difference in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.54 units (0.34-8.71; P=0.036) in the difference in HOMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of the results by intrapair analyses suggests that genetic factors do not confound the association between global DNA methylation and IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exclusion of twins taking <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication (n=17) did not change our results </plain></SENT>
