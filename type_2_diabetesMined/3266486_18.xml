<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas in Type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects serum levels of osteocalcin and 25 hydroxy <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> were not statistically different, serum osteocalcin and 25 hydroxy <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels were significantly decreased in Type 2 diabetic patients when compared with corresponding control subjects (p less than 0.03 and p less than 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
