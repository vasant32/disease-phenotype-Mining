<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS: India has the greatest number of diabetic subjects in any one country, but the genetic basis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in India is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Common non-coding variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have recently been strongly associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether TCF7L2 variants are also associated with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in the Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (n = 955) and ethnically matched control subjects (n = 399) by sequencing three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs4506565) in TCF7L2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a strong association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the polymorphisms, including rs12255372 (odds ratio [OR] 1.50 [95% CI = 1.24-1.82], p = 4.0 x 10(-5)), rs4506565 (OR 1.48 [95% CI = 1.24-1.77], p = 2.0 x 10(-5)) and rs7903146 (OR 1.46 [95% CI = 1.22-1.75], p = 3.0 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three variants showed increased relative risk when homozygous rather than heterozygous, with the strongest risk for rs12255372 (OR 2.28 [95% CI = 1.40-3.72] vs OR 1.43 [95% CI = 1.11-1.83]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no association of the TCF7L2 genotypes with age at diagnosis, BMI or WHR, but the risk genotype at rs12255372 was associated with higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 0.001), higher 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 0.0002) and higher homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-R; p = 0.012) in non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study in Indian subjects replicates the strong association of TCF7L2 variants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also provides evidence that variations in TCF7L2 may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by influencing both insulin secretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCF7L2 is an important gene for determining susceptibility to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and it transgresses the boundaries of ethnicity </plain></SENT>
