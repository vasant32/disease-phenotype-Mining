<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the framework of a nationwide outcomes research program, we investigated the frequency of SMBG and its association with metabolic control and quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study involved 3,567 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were recruited by 101 outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics and 103 general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients completed a questionnaire investigating SMBG practice and QoL (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related stress, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> health distress, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related worries, and Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data on SMBG were available for 2,855 subjects (80% of the entire study population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 471 patients (17%) stated that they tested their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at home &gt; or =1 time per day, 899 patients (31%) tested their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &gt; or =1 time per week, and 414 patients (14%) tested their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &lt;1 time per week, whereas 1,071 patients (38%) stated that they never practiced SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher frequency of SMBG was associated with better metabolic control among subjects who were able to adjust insulin doses, whereas no relationship was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients, irrespective of the kind of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed that an SMBG frequency &gt; or =1 time per day was significantly related to higher levels of distress, worries, and depressive symptoms in non-insulin-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that SMBG can have an important role in improving metabolic control if it is an integral part of a wider educational strategy devoted to the promotion of patient autonomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients not treated with insulin, self-monitoring is associated with higher HbA(1c) levels and psychological burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support the extension of SMBG to this group </plain></SENT>
