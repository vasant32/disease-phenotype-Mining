<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An association between <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> expressed by the homeostasis model (HOMA-R), and the significance of both variables as risk factors for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were investigated in 483 Japanese-American subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum SHBG level was significantly higher in women (68.7 nmol/l) than in men (45.1 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference was also significant independently of age, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), and HOMA-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When multiple regression analysis was performed after adjustment for age and BMI, SHBG was not correlated with HOMA-R in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In women, SHBG was not significantly correlated with HOMA-R after adjustment for age, BMI, and WHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a 3-year prospective analysis, HOMA-R was significantly higher in converters to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than non-converters in both men and women which was independent of age, BMI and WHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, after adjusting these variables, SHBG was not a significant risk factor either in men or women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SHBG might be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> secondarily via BMI and/or WHR in both men and women among Japanese-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HOMA-R is a useful index for both men and women as a risk factor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when only fasting blood samples can be obtained </plain></SENT>
