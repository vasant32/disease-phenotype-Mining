<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the relationships between plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in a cohort of Italian-Caucasian <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and first-phase insulin secretion was measured by intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma IL-6 concentration was negatively correlated with the rate of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (M) (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation remained statistically significant, while attenuated, after adjusting for sex, age, and BMI (P &lt; 0.03); after an additional adjustment for free fatty acids (FFAs), a further attenuation was observed, but statistical significance was maintained (P &lt; 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma IL-6 concentration was positively correlated with first-phase insulin secretion assessed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation remained significant after adjusting for sex, age, and BMI (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To estimate the independent contribution of plasma IL-6 levels to AIR, we carried out forward stepwise linear regression analysis in a model that included sex, age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, FFAs, and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only insulin sensitivity and plasma IL-6 concentration were independently associated with AIR, accounting, respectively, for 19.0 and 5.2% of its variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that IL-6 is associated in a reciprocal manner with the two pathophysiological components of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
