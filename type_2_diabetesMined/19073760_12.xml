<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether baseline systemic levels of IL-1Ra are associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during more than 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured serum IL-1Ra concentrations in a nested case-control study (181 case and 376 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched normoglycemic control subjects) within the Whitehall II cohort (U.K.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-1Ra concentrations were higher in case subjects (P = 0.0006) and associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio for a 1-SD increase of IL-1Ra 1.48 [95% CI 1.21-1.80]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association remained significant after adjustment for multiple potential confounders but was attenuated by adjusting for 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that individuals who will develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are characterized by a complex immune activation that also includes upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1Ra </plain></SENT>
