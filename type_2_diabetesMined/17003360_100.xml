<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects of European origin in the DeCode study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We genotyped the two most associated variants (rs7903146 and rs12255372) in 2,367 French type 2 diabetic subjects and in 2,499 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the T-allele of rs7903146 and the T-allele of rs12255372 significantly increase type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.69 (95% CI 1.55-1.83) (P = 6.0 x 10(-35)) and 1.60 (1.47-1.74) (P = 7.6 x 10(-28)), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nonobese type 2 diabetic subjects (BMI &lt;30 kg/m2, n = 1,346), the ORs increased to 1.89 (1.72-2.09) (P = 2.1 x 10(-38)) and 1.79 (1.62-1.97) (P = 5.7 x 10(-31)), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rs7903146 T at-risk allele associates with <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>decreased BMI</z:mp> and earlier age at diagnosis in the type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 8.0 x 10(-3) and P = 3.8 x 10(-4), respectively), which is supported by quantitative family-based association tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCF7L2 is expressed in most human tissues, including mature pancreatic beta-cells, with the exception of the skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subcutaneous and omental fat from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects, TCF7L2 expression significantly decreased compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> normoglycemic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During rat fetal beta-cell differentiation, TCF7L2 expression pattern mimics the key marker NGN3 (neurogenin 3), suggesting a role in islet development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that TCF7L2 is a major determinant of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in European populations and suggests that this transcription factor plays a key role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
