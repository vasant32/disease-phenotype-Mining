<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied a new member of this family, PAT-1, and found that it is expressed in highly oxidative tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We refer to this protein as "OXPAT." Physiologic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> loading of mouse liver by fasting enriches OXPAT in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplet tissue fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OXPAT resides on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets with the PAT protein adipophilin in primary cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of OXPAT promotes fatty acid-induced triacylglycerol accumulation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15904">long-chain fatty acid</z:chebi> oxidation, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> associated with oxidative metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these observations, OXPAT is induced in mouse adipose tissue, striated muscle, and liver by physiological (fasting), pathophysiological (insulin deficiency), pharmacological (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR] <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>), and genetic (muscle-specific PPARalpha overexpression) perturbations that increase fatty acid utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In humans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> treatment induces adipose OXPAT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, adipose OXPAT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> negatively correlates with BMI in nondiabetic humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our collective data in cells, mice, and humans suggest that OXPAT is a marker for PPAR activation and fatty acid oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OXPAT likely contributes to adaptive responses to the fatty acid burden that accompanies fasting, insulin deficiency, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1257763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overnutrition</z:e>, responses that are defective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
