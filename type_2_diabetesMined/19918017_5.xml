<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, caffeinated coffee acutely impairs <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of decaffeinated coffee on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of decaffeinated coffee, caffeinated coffee, and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) levels during a 2-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) in 11 young men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the first hour of the OGTT, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin were higher for decaffeinated coffee than for placebo (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the whole OGTT, decaffeinated coffee yielded higher insulin than placebo and lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and a higher insulin sensitivity index than <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in GIP could not explain any beverage effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Some types of decaffeinated coffee may acutely impair <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism but less than <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
