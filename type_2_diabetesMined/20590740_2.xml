<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Complications Trial, intensive glycaemic control reduced microvascular outcomes and, on longer term follow-up, a significant reduction in macrovascular events was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For patients with recently diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the findings in the United Kingdom Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study were similar; intensive glycaemic control reduced microvascular events during the intervention phase of the study, and a reduction in macrovascular events was observed on longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, the Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular Disease</z:e>: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation study showed a microvascular benefit of more intensive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in patients with longstanding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> study showed harm if this was performed rapidly, with increase in weight, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these studies suggest that slow and steady intensive control of glycaemia improves outcomes in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and that to reduce mortality this should be commenced early in the management of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
