<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients identified in the General Electric (GE) electronic medical record (EMR) research database from 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2007 were &gt; or =18 years old with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had prescription orders in the previous 395 days for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, or a thiazolidinedione as monotherapy or in combination, and had at least 6 months of follow-up activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical measures were documented from 45 days prior up to 15 days after exenatide initiation and follow-up measures documented at 6 months +/- 45 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1709 patients were identified for study inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall mean A1C reduction (s.e.m.) at 6 months was -0.8% (0.05) (p&lt;0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was -3.2 kg (0.14) (p&lt;0.001), blood pressure (BP) lowering was -1.9 mmHg (0.46) systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p&lt;0.001) and -0.5 mmHg (0.27) diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) (p = 0.078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were -7.4 mg/dl (1.7) (p&lt;0.001), -23.2 mg/dl (6.7) (p = 0.001) and -0.8 mg/dl (0.33) (p = 0.012) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a quartile analysis by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, mean A1C reduction ranged from -1.1 to -0.65% in the highest to lowest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> quartiles respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, exenatide initiation is associated with significant improvements in the measures of clinical effectiveness for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These reductions were comparable to those reported in randomized, controlled registration trials after 6 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
