<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the polymorphisms of RAPGEF1, TP53 and NRF1 and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped rs11243444 (RAPGEF1), rs1042522 (TP53) and rs1882095 (NRF1) in a case-control study, including 273 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 247 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found in a variant of TP53 (rs1042522, odd ratio (OR)=1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.00-1.64; P=0.046), whereas polymorphisms in RAPGEF1, NRF1 were not associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a potential gene-gene interaction showed the odds of being affected with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.54 times greater in subjects with the TP53 (rs1042522) and RAPGEF1 (rs11243444) risk alleles than those without either (95% CI=1.34-4.81; P=0.004) and the NRF1 gene polymorphism reached significance when paired with TP53:(OR=3.87, 95% CI=1.87-8.40; P=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the polymorphism in TP53 (rs1042522) was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and that potential interaction of TP53 (rs1042522) and RAPGEF1 (rs11243444), or NRF1 (rs1882095) increased the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
