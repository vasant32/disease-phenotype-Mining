<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Crossline was measured in serum and erythrocyte membrane proteins (EMP) from 52 type 2 diabetic patients using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum and EMP crossline levels in the diabetic patients were significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels of more than 1.2 mg/dl) had markedly elevated serum crossline levels compared to those with moderate diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>) (180 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EMP crossline levels in the patients with moderate diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (8.8+/-2.9 pmol/mg protein) and those with advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (9.7+/-3.0 pmol/mg protein) were significantly higher than those without clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (6.4+/-1.9 pmol/mg protein; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that EMP crossline levels were associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum crossline levels were significantly influenced by remaining renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The measurement of crossline from a blood sample could provide us with important information for the study of clinical evaluation and pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
