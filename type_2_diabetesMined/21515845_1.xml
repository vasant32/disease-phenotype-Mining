<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship of DR to endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent responses in skin microvascular flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants consisted of 224 individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 85 with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 139 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">Sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) were delivered across the skin by iontophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to assess the skin microcirculation response to SNP (endothelium-independent response) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> (endothelium-dependent response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence and severity of DR were graded from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs using a standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 224 participants, 64.3% had DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, participants with reduced responses to SNP or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> were more likely to have DR, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.33 (95% CI 1.09-5.01) for SNP and 2.20 (1.05-4.61) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>, comparing participants with responses below and above the median values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants with reduced responses (below the median) to both SNP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> were nearly four times more likely to have DR (OR 3.86 [1.45-10.3]) than those with SNP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> both above the median values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of DR was associated with a reduction in skin microcirculation responses to iontophoresis of both SNP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>, suggesting that vascular processes associated with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and endothelial function-independent mechanisms may be pathogenically related to DR </plain></SENT>
