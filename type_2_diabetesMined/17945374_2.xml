<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of circulating nucleases is to destroy nucleic acids and oligonucleotides in the blood stream and during cell entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with juvenile <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>insulin-dependent diabetes</z:mp>, adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>insulin-dependent diabetes</z:mp> and adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were allocated to the study, together with the age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma RNase and nuclease activity were examined, in relation to different substrates-TLRs response modifiers, and circulating <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and oligonucleotides were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fall in enzyme activity in plasma was obtained for rRNA, poly(C), poly(U), poly(I:C), poly(A:U) and CpG, especially in juvenile diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to test the non-enzymatic glycation, commercial RNase (E.C.3.1.27.5) and control plasma samples were incubated with increasing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 50 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fall of enzyme activity was expressed more significantly in control plasma samples than for the commercial enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total amount of purified plasma <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and oligonucleotides was significantly higher in diabetic patients, especially in juvenile diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase in the concentration of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> corresponded to the peak absorbance at 270 nm, similar to polyC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The electrophoretic bands shared similar characteristics between controls and each type of diabetic patients, except that the bands were more expressed in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreased RNase activity and related increase of circulating oligonucleotides may favor the increase of nucleic acid "danger motifs", leading to TLRs activation </plain></SENT>
