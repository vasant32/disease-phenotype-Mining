<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, selection for molecular genetic testing for MODY has used discrete cut-offs of limited clinical characteristics with varying sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to use multiple, weighted, clinical criteria to determine an individual's probability of having MODY, as a crucial tool for rational genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed prediction models using logistic regression on data from 1,191 patients with MODY (n = 594), type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 278) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 319) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Model performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, cross-validation and validation in a further 350 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The models defined an overall probability of MODY using a weighted combination of the most discriminative characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For MODY, compared with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, these were: lower HbA(1c), parent with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, female sex and older age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MODY was discriminated from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by: lower BMI, younger age at diagnosis, female sex, lower HbA(1c), parent with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and not being treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both models showed excellent discrimination (c-statistic = 0.95 and 0.98, respectively), low rates of cross-validated misclassification (9.2% and 5.3%), and good performance on the external test dataset (c-statistic = 0.95 and 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the optimal cut-offs, the probability models improved the sensitivity (91% vs 72%) and specificity (94% vs 91%) for identifying MODY compared with standard criteria of diagnosis &lt;25 years and an affected parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The models are now available online at www.diabetesgenes.org  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have developed clinical prediction models that calculate an individual's probability of having MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This allows an improved and more rational approach to determine who should have molecular genetic testing </plain></SENT>
