<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall, 1,571 new cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with zero alcohol consumption, consumption of 15-29 g/day of alcohol was associated with a 36% lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.53-0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This inverse association between moderate consumption and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remained if light drinkers rather than abstainers were used as the reference group (RR = 0.60, CI 0.50-0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were few heavy drinkers, but the inverse association persisted to those drinking &gt;/=50 g/day of alcohol (RR = 0.60, CI 0.43-0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequency of consumption was inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consumption of alcohol on at least 5 days/week provided the greatest protection, even when less than one drink per drinking day was consumed (RR = 0.48, CI 0.27-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with infrequent drinkers, for each additional day per week that alcohol was consumed, risk was reduced by 7% (95% CI 3-10%) after controlling for average daily consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were similar and independent inverse associations for beer, liquor, and white wine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested that frequent alcohol consumption conveys the greatest protection against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even if the level of consumption per drinking day is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Beverage choice did not alter risk </plain></SENT>
