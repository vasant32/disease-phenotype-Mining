<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity, and its decreased levels are supposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and other disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to estimate the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and serum free fatty acids (FFA) elevation on circulating BDNF concentration in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 18 healthy male subjects (mean age 25.6 ± 3.0 years; mean BMI 26.6 ± 4.8 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum and plasma BDNF concentration was measured in the baseline state and in the 120 and 360 min of euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with or without intralipid/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, plasma BDNF was measured in 20 male subjects (mean age 22.7 ± 2.3 years; mean BMI 24.9 ± 1.5 kg/m(2)) 360 min after a high-fat meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity was reduced by ~40% after 6 h of intralipid/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During both clamps, serum and plasma BDNF followed the same pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>Hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> had no effect on circulating BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Raising FFA had no effect on circulating BDNF in 120 min; however, it resulted in a significant decrease by 43% in serum and by 35% in plasma BDNF after 360 min (P = 0.005 and 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High-fat meal also resulted in a decrease by 27.8% in plasma BDNF (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that raising FFA decreases circulating BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This might indicate a potential link between FFA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
