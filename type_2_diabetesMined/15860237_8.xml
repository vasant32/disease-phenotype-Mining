<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-arteriosclerotic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> using pulse wave velocity (PWV) as an index of efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to two groups, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (n=13) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (n=14) was administered for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TG, TC, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, FPG, HbA1c, IRI levels, HOMA-IR, and ba-PWV data were examined before and after administration of each agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FPG and HbA1c were significantly improved in both the groups after treatment, but IRI, HOMA-IR and were improved only in the PIO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percent change of ba-PWV from the baseline after treatment in the PIO group improved significantly than that in the GC group (-6.3 +/- 5.6% versus 0.8 +/- 5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this study suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> has anti-arteriosclerotic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that drugs for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> should be selected taking into consideration such endpoints as blood sugar control, and also the risk of complications such as cardiovascular events in the future </plain></SENT>
