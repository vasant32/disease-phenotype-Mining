<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are manifestations of the inflammatory host response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This host response is orchestrated by the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that are under genetic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that a low production capacity of interleukin-10 (IL-10), a centrally operating cytokine with strong anti-inflammatory properties, associates with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, 599 inhabitants of the city of Leiden, age 85 years, were visited at their place of residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The production capacity of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was assessed in a whole-blood assay in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> was used as a stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HbA(1c) were determined, and a history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HbA(1c) gradually decreased over strata representing higher IL-10 production capacity, whereas the concentration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> gradually increased (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.7 (95% confidence interval 1.5-4.9) when subjects with the lowest IL-10 production capacity were compared with those with the highest IL-10 production capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings showed that low IL-10 production capacity (i.e., a pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>) is associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
