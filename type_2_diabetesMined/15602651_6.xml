<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody-positive relatives of patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at increased risk for disease, while the presence of HLA DQA1*0102/DQB1*0602 is thought to confer protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the unique population identified by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Trial--Type <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="39161">DPT</z:chebi>-1), our aim was to determine if these individuals were protected from type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We described metabolic and immunological characteristics of islet cell cytoplasmic autoantibodies-positive relatives with DQB1*0602 identified as part of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39161">DPT</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 32% of DQB1*0602-positive relatives identified through the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39161">DPT</z:chebi>-1 had abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance despite the fact that only 19% had multiple type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated autoantibodies and only 13% had <z:mp ids='MP_0003564'>abnormal insulin secretion</z:mp>, markers typically associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, these markers were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the DQB1*0602-positive relatives had elevated fasting insulin (117+/-10 pmol/l) and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-R) (4.90+/-0.5) values, which are more commonly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The later marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that DQA1*0102/DQB1*0602 relatives identified through <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39161">DPT</z:chebi>-1 have a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and a disease phenotype with characteristics of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, multiple pathways to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> are present within families of these type 1 patients </plain></SENT>
