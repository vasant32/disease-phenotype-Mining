<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis was tested that both beta cell failure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> can be reversed by dietary restriction of energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (49.5 ± 2.5 years, BMI 33.6 ± 1.2 kg/m(2), nine male and two female) were studied before and after 1, 4 and 8 weeks of a 2.5 MJ (600 kcal)/day diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basal hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output, hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pancreas and liver triacylglycerol content was measured using three-point Dixon magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An age-, sex- and weight-matched group of eight non-diabetic participants was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 week of restricted energy intake, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> normalised in the diabetic group (from 9.2 ± 0.4 to 5.9 ± 0.4 mmol/l; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin suppression of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output improved from 43 ± 4% to 74 ± 5% (p = 0.003 vs baseline; controls 68 ± 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hepatic triacylglycerol content fell from 12.8 ± 2.4% in the diabetic group to 2.9 ± 0.2% by week 8 (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first-phase insulin response increased during the study period (0.19 ± 0.02 to 0.46 ± 0.07 nmol min(-1) m(-2); p &lt; 0.001) and approached control values (0.62 ± 0.15 nmol min(-1) m(-2); p = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maximal insulin response became supranormal at 8 weeks (1.37 ± 0.27 vs controls 1.15 ± 0.18 nmol min(-1) m(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic triacylglycerol decreased from 8.0 ± 1.6% to 6.2 ± 1.1% (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Normalisation of both beta cell function and hepatic insulin sensitivity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was achieved by dietary energy restriction alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was associated with decreased pancreatic and liver triacylglycerol stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities underlying type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are reversible by reducing dietary energy intake </plain></SENT>
