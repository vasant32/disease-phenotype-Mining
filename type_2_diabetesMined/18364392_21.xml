<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carbohydrate counting is an effective approach to mealtime insulin adjustment in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but has not been rigorously assessed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio with a simple algorithm for adjusting the dose of prandial insulin glusiline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS: This 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled study compared two algorithms for adjusting mealtime (glulisine) insulin along with a standard algorithm for adjusting background (glargine) insulin in 273 intent-to-treat patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glulisine and glargine were adjusted weekly in both groups based on self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) results from the previous week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The simple algorithm group was provided set doses of glulisine to take before each meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The carbohydrate counting (carb count) group was provided an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio to use for each meal and adjusted their glulisine dose based on the amount of carbohydrate consumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1C levels at week 24 were 6.70% (simple algorithm) and 6.54% (carb count) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The respective mean A1C changes from baseline to 24 weeks were -1.46 and -1.59% (P = 0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A1C &lt;7.0% was achieved by 73.2% (simple algorithm) and 69.2% (carb count) (P = 0.70) of subjects; respective values for A1C &lt;6.5% were 44.3 and 49.5% (P = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total daily dose of insulin was lower, and there was a trend toward less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in carb count group patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates were low and equal in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Weekly basal-bolus insulin adjustments based on premeal and bedtime <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> patterns resulted in significant reductions in A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Having two effective approaches to delivering and adjusting rapid-acting mealtime insulin may increase physicians' and patients' willingness to advance therapy to a basal-bolus insulin regimen </plain></SENT>
