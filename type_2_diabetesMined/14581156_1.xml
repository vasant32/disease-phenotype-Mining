<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of fasting serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels, pre-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) mass, several other metabolic parameters, and intra-abdominal fat areas in 26 Japanese poorly controlled type 2 diabetic men and 23 women when matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and HbA1c between genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Study subjects were Japanese type 2 diabetic patients who were admitted to our hospital between Jun 2001 and Aug 2002 because of their poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 49 subjects [40-79 years of age, average age 61.5 +/- 8.7; mean BMI 23.2 +/- 3.7 kg/m2] with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) and HbA1c levels being 251 +/- 76.5 mg/dl and 10.8 +/- 2.2%, respectively, were involved in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pre-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> LPL mass was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remnant like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) level was measured using an immunoaffinity mixed gel containing anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) A-I and anti-apo B monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum leptin level was determined by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra-abdominal fat area was determined by computerized tomography analysis at the umbilical level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The men group showed a higher serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) and RLP-C levels, and lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels and pre-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plasma LPL mass than did women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum leptin level was higher in women than in men counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intra-abdominal subcutaneous fat areas were significantly larger in women than in men counterparts, whereas the visceral fat areas did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In Japanese population, poorly controlled type 2 diabetic men had more unfavorable <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile than did women counterparts, which may be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0008033'>decreased lipolysis</z:mp> of plasma TG-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> by LPL </plain></SENT>
