<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Based on its role as an energy storage compartment and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> organ, white adipose tissue (WAT) fulfills a critical function in the maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, WAT dysfunction is connected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> triggered at least partly by an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pseudokinase tribbles (TRB) 3 has been identified by us and others as a critical regulator of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and WAT <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypothesis that the TRB gene family fulfills broader functions in the integration of metabolic and inflammatory pathways in various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine the role of TRB family members for WAT function, we profiled the expression patterns of TRB13 under healthy and metabolic stress conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differentially expressed TRB1 was functionally characterized in loss-of-function animal and primary adipocyte models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here, we show that the expression of TRB1 was specifically upregulated during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in WAT of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of TRB1 was found to impair cytokine gene expression in white adipocytes and to protect against high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In adipocytes, TRB1 served as a nuclear transcriptional coactivator for the nuclear factor kappaB subunit RelA, thereby promoting the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is typically seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the dual role of TRB1 as both a target and a (co) activator of inflammatory signaling might provide a molecular rationale for the amplification of proinflammatory responses in WAT in these subjects </plain></SENT>
