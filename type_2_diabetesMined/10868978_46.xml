<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome have been hypothesized to constitute manifestations of an ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study an interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene polymorphism in relation to insulin sensitivity (IL-6 is the main cytokine involved in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects homozygous for the C allele at position -174 of the IL-6 gene (SfaNI genotype), associated to lower plasma IL-6 levels, showed significantly lower integrated area under the curve of serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (AUCglucose) after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, lower blood glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, lower fasting insulin levels, lower total and differential white blood cell count (a putative marker of peripheral IL-6 action), and an <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> index than carriers of the G allele, despite similar age and body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A gene dosage effect was especially remarkable for AUCglucose (6.4 vs. 9.3 vs. 9.7 mmol/l in C/C, C/G, and G/G individuals, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration of fully glycosylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> binding globulin (another marker of IL-6 action), suggested by concanavalin A adsorption, was lower in C/C subjects than in G/G individuals (32.6+/-2.9 vs. 37.6+/-4.6 mg/l, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, a polymorphism of the IL-6 gene influences the relationship among insulin sensitivity, postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and peripheral white blood cell count </plain></SENT>
