<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Data on latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA) from population-based studies are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the prevalence and correlates of LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 8,109 participants, who were aged ≥15 years and living in Tianjin, China, were assessed to identify individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association Criteria, 1997) and further to detect patients with LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LADA was ascertained by 1) the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age ≥35 years, 2) the lack of a requirement for insulin at least 6 months after the diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 3) serum GAD antibody positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, 498 (6.1%) were patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of them, 46 (9.2%) were found to have LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LADA was 0.6% (46 of 8,109), and tended to increase with age up to 50-59 years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (95% CI) of LADA related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, waist-to-hip ratio ≥0.85, and major stressful events were 1.93 (1.02-3.65), 17.59 (9.08-34.06), 5.37 (2.31-12.49), and 4.09 (1.75-9.52), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LADA is ∼9% in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and major stressful events may be associated with the occurrence of LADA </plain></SENT>
