<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the health-related quality of life (HRQOL), the resource utilization and annual costs associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> (DN) in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study German internists, diabetologists and general practitioners provided information on 185 adult type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using generic and disease specific questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Socio-demographic and resource use data were assessed from medical charts and through patient interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, national-level cost estimates were calculated using German unit costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of DN patients were severely impaired with regard to general physical HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease specific HRQOL decreased continuously with increasing DN severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In accordance, costs associated with DN increased as DN progressed, with costs from the societal perspective increasing about 50-fold from the lowest severity stage (patients with sensory-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235025" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor neuropathy</z:e> without symptoms) (euro431) to patients with lower extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> in the year 2002 (euro21,476) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The German statutory health insurance covered more than two thirds of the total costs of DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results described in this report show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> in adults with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> generates significant reductions in the patient's quality of life and a substantial economic burden both for society and health insurance </plain></SENT>
