<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> use and mortality in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Using the Saskatchewan health databases, 12,272 new users of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> were identified between the years of 1991 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded 3,202 subjects with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining subjects, 1,187 "new users" of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> were identified (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects not receiving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy throughout the follow-up period served as the control cohort (n = 4,989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects were prospectively followed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or the end of 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality between cohort groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects were 60.7 +/- 13.7 years old, 43.6% female, and were followed for an average of 5.3 +/- 2.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy was 3.6 +/- 1.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed significantly fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> group (102 [8.6%]) compared with the control cohort (853 [17.1%]), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of 0.49 (0.40-0.61) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular-related mortality was also reduced (40 [3.4%] vs. 261 [5.2%], adjusted HR, 0.63 [0.44-0.90]; P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> was associated with a significant reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality in a broad spectrum of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
