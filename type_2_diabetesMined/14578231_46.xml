<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although a link between <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>small body size</z:mp> at birth and later type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been repeatedly documented, less is known about the associations between the disease and growth during infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the pathways of infant and early growth that lead to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We carried out a longitudinal study of 8760 subjects born in Helsinki from 1934 to 1944 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On average, they had 8 measurements of height and weight between birth and 1 year of age and another 10 measurements between 1 and 12 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a national register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among babies whose birth weights were &lt;or=3.5 kg, the rate of infant growth was unrelated to later type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among babies with birth weights &gt;3.5 kg, slow growth in length between birth and 3 months of age predicted later disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rapid gain in BMI after age 2 years increased the risk of later disease in both groups of babies, but this effect was greatest among children who had slow growth in length between birth and 3 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In children whose Z-scores for length decreased, an SD increase in BMI at age 12 years was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 1.77 (95% CI 1.50-2.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The corresponding OR in subjects whose Z-scores for length increased was 1.42 (95% CI 1.20-1.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rapid gain in childhood BMI was associated with high maternal BMI and socioeconomic factors (fewer people in the home and lower social class) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Babies with above-average birth weights may develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later in life if poor living conditions lead to faltering growth in length in the first few months after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We speculate that growth faltering at this time is associated with lifelong impairment of insulin metabolism and inability to meet the challenge of rapid childhood increase in BMI </plain></SENT>
