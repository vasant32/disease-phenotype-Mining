<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample comprised 7,466 individuals (55.9% women) free from self-reported doctor-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and was prospectively followed for a mean of 45.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline self-reported physical activity was categorised as physical inactivity, low- and vigorous/moderate-intensity physical activity at least once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model the association between baseline physical activity and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vigorous/moderate-intensity physical activity at least once a week was associated with reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.95, p = 0.026) but low-intensity physical activity at least once a week was not (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58-1.30, p = 0.497) after adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, age-stratified analysis showed that low-intensity physical activity at least once a week was associated with reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for those aged 70 years and over (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28-1.02, p = 0.059), but not for those aged 50 to 59 years (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52-2.29, p = 0.828) or those aged 60 to 69 years (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55-2.41, p = 0.715) after adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Compared with physical inactivity, any type of physical activity was associated with reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults aged 70 years and over, while in adults aged 50 to 69 years, physical activity needed to be vigorous/moderate in intensity to be associated with reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
