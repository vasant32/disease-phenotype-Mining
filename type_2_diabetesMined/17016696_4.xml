<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This case-control study (66 patients) compared four age-matched groups: control, type 2 diabetic, CAD, and diabetic subjects with CAD (DCAD) and left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CAD patients had 1-2 vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diastolic and systolic myocardial velocities were assessed with pulsed tissue Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global myocardial perfusion was assessed with contrast echocardiography as indices of capillary blood volume and myocardial blood flow at maximal vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CAD and DCAD patients, functional and perfusion parameters were additionally assessed in the territory with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary angiogram reading, providing a model for comparison with the global data from control and diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparing diabetic with control subjects, myocardial velocity at early diastole was impaired (8.8+/-1.8 vs 10.1+/-1.7 cm/s; p=0.02) and correlated inversely with age, HbA(1c) and pulse pressure (R (2)=0.761) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Capillary blood volume (16.6+/-5.0 vs 24.4+/-4.9%) and blood flow (56+/-35 vs 114+/-40) were decreased (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In CAD patients, myocardial velocity at early diastole was similarly decreased (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAD and DCAD patients were receiving more cardiovascular preventive therapy for the same extent of impaired global perfusion as in the less extensively treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group without CAD (p&lt;0.002), but had superior perfusion of the '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' coronary territory than that group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, global diastolic function and myocardial capillary blood volume and blood flow are impaired to the same extent as in patients with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These impairments could form the basis of new therapeutic concepts </plain></SENT>
