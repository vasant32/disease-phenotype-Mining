<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the arterial stiffness in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients using brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), to demonstrate the correlation between arterial stiffness and multiple CAOD, and to suggest the cutoff point of baPWV for predicting multiple CAOD in Korean type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty-one <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 262 non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routine anthropometric and serologic data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>baPWV was measured the day before coronary angiography, and the severity of CAOD was assessed with Gensini score after angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>baPWV and Gensini score were significantly increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and Gensini score had a positive correlation with baPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the highest tertile of baPWV showed odds ratio of 3.06 for multiple CAOD compared to the lowest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ROC curve, baPWV at 1635 cm/s showed 73% sensitivity and 75% specificity with AUC 0.76 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients in detecting multiple CAOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, baPWV may be utilized a screening tool for predicting multiple CAOD, especially in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
