<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p53, a key regulator of the cell cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, has mostly been a focus of investigation as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although p53 alternative transcripts can modulate p53 activity, their functions are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that β-cell proliferation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis were controlled by Δ40p53, a p53 isoform lacking the transactivation domain of the full-length protein that modulates total p53 activity and regulates organ size and life span in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We phenotyped metabolic parameters in Δ40p53 transgenic (p44tg) mice and used quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry to examine β-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transgenic mice with an ectopic p53 gene encoding Δ40p53 developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002727'>hypoinsulinemia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> by 3 months of age, which worsened in older mice and led to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from ∼14 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a dramatic decrease in β-cell mass and reduced β-cell proliferation, lower expression of cyclin D2 and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1, two key regulators of proliferation, was observed, whereas expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, a p53 target gene, was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a significant and novel role for Δ40p53 in β-cell proliferation with implications for the development of age-dependent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
