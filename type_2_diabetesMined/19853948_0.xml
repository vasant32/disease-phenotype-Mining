<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Patient data from the Czech National Register of patients treated with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) were evaluated to compare treatment indication, efficacy and safety with specific regard to the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1 vs. T2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Evaluation was done on complete data sets of at least 3 years from patients with either T1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=730, 93.1%) or T2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=54, 6.9%) between 1995 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) decreased from 9.65 (+/-0.07) and 9.66 (+/-0.05) for T1 and T2 respectively to 8.24 (+/-0.07) for T1 and 8.52 (+/-0.27) for T2 after 1 year of treatment, 8.34 (+/-0.07) and 8.54 (+/-0.26) after 2 years and 8.44 (+/-0.07) and 8.71 (+/-0.25) after 3 years (adjusted mean values, +/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This reduction is significant for both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results gathered from the safety analysis revealed almost comparable results for both patient groups (rates of adverse events of 42.5 and 34.8 for T1 and T2, per 100 patients and year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both patient groups achieved substantial reduction of HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety evaluation showed that fewer patients with T2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were affected by adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to that CSII treatment for patients with T2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is similarly effective with a slightly better safety profile </plain></SENT>
