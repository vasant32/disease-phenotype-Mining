<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, perceptions of a co-morbid condition and the use of multiple medicines have yet to be researched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the illness and treatment perceptions of people with co-morbid T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (repeated for T2D, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>) and the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire Specific Concerns Scales (repeated for Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, anti-hypertensive medicines, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) were sent to 480 people managing co-morbid T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on the number of medicines prescribed were collected from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly different perceptions were found across the illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strongest effect was for personal control; the greatest control reported for T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Illness perceptions of T2D differed significantly from perceptions about <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, illness perceptions of T2D also differed from perceptions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with the exception of perceptions of illness severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> shared similar perceptions about comprehensibility, concerns, personal control, and timeline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found for beliefs about treatment necessity, but no difference was found for treatment concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the number of medicines was taken as a between-subjects factor, only intentional non-adherence, treatment necessity beliefs, and perceptions of illness timeline were accounted for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Co-morbid illness and treatment perceptions are complex, often vary between illnesses, and can be influenced by the number of medicines prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further research should investigate relationships between co-morbid illness and treatment perception structures and self-management practices </plain></SENT>
