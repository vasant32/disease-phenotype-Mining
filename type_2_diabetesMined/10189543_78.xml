<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 27 clinical centers in the U.S. are recruiting at least 3,000 participants of both sexes, approximately 50% of whom are minority patients and 20% of whom are &gt; or = 65 years old, to be assigned at random to one of three intervention groups: an intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on a healthy diet and exercise and two masked medication treatment groups--<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or placebo--combined with standard diet and exercise recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants are being recruited during a 2 2/3-year period, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> will be followed for an additional 3 1/3 to 5 years after the close of recruitment to a common closing date in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, diagnosed by fasting or post-challenge plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations meeting the 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3,000 participants will provide 90% power to detect a 33% reduction in an expected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence rate of at least 6.5% per year in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and its risk factors; changes in glycemia, beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, diet, physical activity, and health-related quality of life; and occurrence of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A fourth treatment group--<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> combined with standard diet and exercise recommendations--was included initially but discontinued because of the liver toxicity of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This randomized clinical trial will test the possibility of preventing or delaying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals at high risk </plain></SENT>
