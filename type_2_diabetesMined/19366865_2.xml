<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic and 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic subjects were infused intravenously with [3,5-(2)H(2)] <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> enriched at a C5-to-C3 ratio of 1.0 as well as the enrichment of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29237">deuterium</z:chebi> on C5 and C3 of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, measured with nuclear magnetic resonance using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32636">acetaminophen glucuronide</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ratio of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29237">deuterium</z:chebi> enrichment on C5 and C3 of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was &lt;1 (P &lt; 0.001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, resulting in a means +/- SE C5-to-C3 ratio that did not differ between groups (0.81 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: That the C5-to-C3 <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio is &lt;1 indicates that transaldolase exchange, selective retention of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29237">deuterium</z:chebi> at the level of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="27137">triose</z:chebi>-isomerase reaction, or both occur in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This also indicates that the net effect of these processes on the C5-to-C3 ratio is the same in people with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible effects of transaldolase exchange or selective retention of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29237">deuterium</z:chebi> (or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29298">tritium</z:chebi>) at the level of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="27137">triose</z:chebi>-isomerase reaction on tracee labeling and tracer metabolism should be considered when the deuterated water method is used to measure gluconeogenesis or [3-(3)H] <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is used to measure <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover in humans </plain></SENT>
