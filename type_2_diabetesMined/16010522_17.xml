<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether this is a result of a specific defect in GIP action or of a general reduction in beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, impaired secretion of glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) has been described in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the insulinotropic effect of GIP in women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> (pGDM) under euglycaemic fasting conditions and during a hyperglycaemic clamp experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secretion of GIP and GLP-1 was assessed following oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: On separate occasions we performed an OGTT and administered an i.v. bolus of 20 pmol GIP/kg body weight in 20 women with pGDM and 20 control women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional hyperglycaemic clamp experiment (140 mg/dl [7.8 mmol/l] over 120 min) with i.v. infusion of GIP (2 pmol kg(-1) min(-1); 30-90 min) was performed in 14 women in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Capillary and venous blood samples were drawn for the measurement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidase), insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, GIP and GLP-1 (specific immunoassays) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were carried out using repeated measures ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations increased to higher levels in the women with pGDM than in the control women (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The women with pGDM were characterised by a higher degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> than the control women (p=0.007 for the Matsuda index), but showed no overt defects in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (p=0.40 for the insulinogenic index following i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The secretion of GLP-1 and GIP was not different between the groups (p=0.87 and p=0.57, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The insulin secretory response to GIP administration was similar in the two groups both after GIP bolus administration and during the hyperglycaemic clamp experiment (p=0.99 and p=0.88, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A hyperbola-like relationship was found between the degree of insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and the insulin secretory response to GIP and i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results do not support the hypothesis of an early defect in GIP action as a risk factor for subsequent development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The inverse relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the insulin secretory response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or GIP suggests that beta cell secretory function in response to different stimuli increases adaptively when insulin sensitivity is diminished </plain></SENT>
