<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of complications and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was diagnosed by <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of most complications were higher among survivors because of longer duration and older age, as follows, for survivors versus nonsurvivors: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, 76 vs. 62%; <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, 39.1 vs. 27.3%; macroalbuminuria, 8.4 vs. 23.7%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, 86.5 vs. 63.5%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, 23.1 vs. 11.4%; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 44.5 vs. 40.7%.CONCLUSIONSLong-term survivors with T2DM had better glycemic and blood pressure control and more favorable <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
