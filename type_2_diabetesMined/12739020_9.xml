<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, ghrelin has been associated with beneficial haemodynamic effects in experimental settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the Arg51Gln mutation changes the carboxyterminal amino acid of the mature hormone and is associated with low ghrelin concentrations, we assessed the hypothesis that Arg51Gln mutation is a risk factor for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood pressure recordings and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test were carried out in the hypertensive ( n=519) and control cohorts ( n=526) of our well-defined OPERA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotypes and plasma IGF-I and IGFBP-1 concentrations of 1031 subjects were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ghrelin 51Gln allele was a risk factor for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the effect remained significant after adjustment for age, BMI, and study group (OR=2.53, CI: 1.11-5.75, p=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the 51Gln allele was a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR=2.63, CI: 1.37-5.08, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>51Gln carriers had lower concentrations of IGF-I and higher concentrations of IGFBP-1 compared to non-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The ghrelin 51Gln allele could increase the risk for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The low IGF-I concentrations in 51Gln carriers suggest that the mechanism might be associated with low GH concentrations </plain></SENT>
