<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In Chinese populations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is common and is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, particularly when associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clustering of these disorders and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is termed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and is increasing in prevalence in the populations of modernizing Asian nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) helps maintain blood pressure and salt homeostasis and may play a role in the pathogenesis of aspects of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated three <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> gene polymorphisms--the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D), angiotensinogen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) M235T, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT1R) A1166C polymorphisms--for a possible role in modulating these disorders in 853 Chinese subjects with varying components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The three gene polymorphisms of this cross-sectional study were detected using polymerase chain reaction-based protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies were compared between the controls (n = 119) and both overlapping and nonoverlapping groups of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> using chi2 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in levels of the biochemical parameters between the genotypes were determined using analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant relationship was identified between these polymorphisms and blood pressure in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the AT1RA1166C polymorphism was not associated with any aspect of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> examined, there was limited evidence to suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> M235T polymorphism may be associated with cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ACE I allele was significantly more frequent in each group comprising subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (GIT), and the I allele was associated with higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that these polymorphisms are unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, having a higher frequency of I allele-containing genotypes in those groups, but this appeared to result predominantly from the relationship with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/GIT in this population of Chinese subjects </plain></SENT>
