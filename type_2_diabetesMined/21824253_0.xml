<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the dysregulated glucagon secretion that is evident in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has significant implications in the pathophysiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glucagon secretion from pancreatic α-cells has been suggested to be modulated by blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, signals from the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to these regulators, intraislet factors acting in a paracrine manner from neighbouring β-cells are emerging as central modulator(s) of α-cell biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the most important of these paracrine factors, insulin, modulates glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the α-cell-specific insulin receptor knockout (αIRKO) mouse manifests hypersecretion of glucagon in the postprandial stage and exhibits defective secretion in fasting-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, together mimicking the α-cell defects observed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, αIRKO mice display a progressive increase in β-cell mass and a concomitant decrease in α-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lineage trace analyses reveal that the new β-cells originate, in part, from the insulin receptor-deficient α-cells indicating a critical role for α-cell insulin signalling in determining β-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our studies also reveal that glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) treatment of αIRKO mice suppresses glucagon secretion despite absence of functional insulin receptors precluding a role for insulin in GLP-1 action on α-cells in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the significance of insulin signalling in the regulation of α-cell biology </plain></SENT>
