<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Leptin is produced in adipose tissue and acts in the hypothalamus to regulate food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent evidence also indicates a potential for direct roles for leptin in peripheral tissues, including those of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide direct evidence that macrophages are a target tissue for leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that J774.2 macrophages express the functional long form of the leptin receptor (ObRb) and that this becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation with low doses of leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leptin also stimulates both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of leptin on hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which acts as a neutral cholesterol esterase in macrophages and is a rate-limiting step in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol ester</z:chebi> breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leptin significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0011590'>increased HSL</z:mp> activity in J774.2 macrophages, and these effects were additive with the effects of cAMP and were blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50914">PI 3-kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, insulin inhibited HSL in macrophages, but unlike adipocytes, this effect did not require PI 3-kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that leptin and insulin regulate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol-ester</z:chebi> homeostasis in macrophages and, therefore, defects in this process caused by leptin and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> could contribute to the increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> found associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
