<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Y(1)<z:chebi fb="51" ids="50323">-dA</z:chebi>(2)-I(12)-N(17)-V(18)-I(27)-G(28,29)-glucagon (termed YAG-glucagon) was incubated with dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP-IV) to assess stability, BRIN-BD11 cells to evaluate insulin secretion, and receptor-transfected cells to examine cAMP production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering and insulinotropic properties of YAG-glucagon were assessed in National Institutes of Health (NIH) Swiss mice, while longer-term actions on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, insulin secretion, food intake and body weight were examined in high-fat-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: YAG-glucagon was resistant to DPP-IV, increased in vitro insulin secretion (1.5-3-fold; p &lt; 0.001) and stimulated cAMP production in GIP receptor-, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) receptor- and glucagon receptor-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly reduced (by 51%; p &lt; 0.01) and insulin concentrations increased (1.2-fold; p &lt; 0.01) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injection of YAG-glucagon in NIH Swiss mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> actions were countered by established GIP, GLP-1 and glucagon <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In high-fat-fed mice, twice-daily administration of YAG-glucagon for 14 days reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (40% reduction; p &lt; 0.01) and increased plasma insulin concentrations (1.8-fold; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic responses were markedly improved (19-48% reduction; p &lt; 0.05) and insulin secretion enhanced (1.5-fold; p &lt; 0.05) after a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, which were independent of changes in insulin sensitivity, food intake and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: YAG-glucagon is a DPP-IV-resistant triple <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of GIP, GLP-1 and glucagon receptors and exhibits beneficial biological properties suggesting that it may hold promise for treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
