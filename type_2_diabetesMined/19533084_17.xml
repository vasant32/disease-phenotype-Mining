<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports have shown that genetic variation in the genes for glucokinase (GCK), glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), islet-specific <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6 phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (G6PC2) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptor type 1B (MTNR1B) is associated with FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined whether these loci also contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A random selection from the Dutch New Hoorn Study was used for replication of the association with FGP (2,361 non-diabetic participants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the genetic association study we extended the study sample with 2,628 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk allele counting was used to calculate a four-gene risk allele score for each individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variants of the GCK, G6PC2 and MTNR1B genes but not GCKR were associated with FPG (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt;or= 0.001; GCKR, p = 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining these four genes in a risk allele score resulted in an increase of 0.05 mmol/l (0.04-0.07) per additional risk allele (p = 2 x 10(-13)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, participants with less than three or more than five risk alleles showed significantly different type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility compared with the most common group with four risk alleles (OR 0.77 [0.65-0.93], p = 0.005 and OR 2.05 [1.50-2.80], p = 4 x 10(-6) respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The age at diagnosis was also significantly associated with the number of risk alleles (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combined risk allele score for single-nucleotide polymorphisms in four known FPG loci is significantly associated with FPG and HbA(1c) in a Dutch population-based sample of non-diabetic participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Carriers of low or high numbers of risk alleles show significantly different risks for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the reference group </plain></SENT>
