<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were derived from healthcare claims for individuals with employer-sponsored primary or Medicare supplemental insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A baseline period (30 September 2006 to 30 September 2007) was used to identify eligible patients and collect information on their clinical and demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An evaluation period (1 October 2007 to 30 September 2008) was used to identify HEs and ACVEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients aged ≥ 18 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were selected for analysis by a modified Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed with multiple logistic regression and backward stepwise selection (maximum P = 0.01) with adjustment for important confounding variables, including age, sex, geography, insurance type, comorbidity scores, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, total baseline medical expenditures, and prior ACVEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 860,845 patients in the analysis set, 27,065 (3.1%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM-coded HEs during the evaluation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main model retained 17 significant independent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with HEs had 79% higher regression-adjusted odds (HE odds ratio [OR] 1.79; 95% CI 1.69-1.89) of ACVEs than patients without HEs; results in patients aged ≥65 years were similar to those for the entire population (HE OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.65-1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM-coded HEs were independently associated with an increased risk of ACVEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and the risk of ACVEs are warranted </plain></SENT>
