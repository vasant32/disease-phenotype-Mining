<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify risk factors for the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, the longitudinal study for 10 years was conducted on 67 outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who had shown no overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The urinary albumin index (UAI) has been determined based on the mean of at least two random urine samples each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Categories were defined as normoalbuminuria (UAI &lt; 30.0 mg/g x Cr.), <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (30.0 &lt; or = UAI &lt; 300.0), and macroalbuminuria (UAI &gt; or = 300.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression was defined as worsening of the category and/or more than doubling of the baseline UAI value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption as independent variables and the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> as a dependent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age and HbA1c were estimated as significant and independent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen were analyzed to evaluate the genetic contribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The D/D genotype of ACE was significantly more common in progressors than in non-progressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that glycemic control and age are important risk factors and the D/D genotype of ACE acts as a risk factor for the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
