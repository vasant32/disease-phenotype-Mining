<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incidence of high dietary carbohydrate-induced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is increasing worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">Methylglyoxal</z:chebi> (MG) is a reactive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolite and a major precursor of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MG levels are elevated in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of MG on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and β-cell insulin secreting mechanism in 12-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MG (60 mg/kg/day) or 0.9% saline was administered by continuous infusion with a minipump for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance tests and measured adipose tissue <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also used cultured INS-1E cells, a pancreatic β-cell line, for molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blotting, quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In rats treated with MG and MG + l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), MG levels were significantly elevated in plasma, pancreas, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle; fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was elevated, whereas insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These two groups also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, reduced GLUT-4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-3-kinase activity, and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the pancreatic β-cells, MG and MG + BSO <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp>, pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1, MafA, GLUT-2, and glucokinase expression; increased C/EBPβ, nuclear factor-κB, MG-induced AGE, N(ε)-carboxymeythyllysine, and receptor for AGEs expression; and caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alagebrium, an MG scavenger and an AGE-breaking compound, attenuated the effects of MG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> MG induces biochemical and molecular abnormalities characteristic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is a possible mediator of high carbohydrate-induced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
