<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the IGF genes have been found to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, birth weight, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These associations could result from changes in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion using hyperglycemic clamps in carriers of a CA repeat in the IGF-I promoter and an ApaI polymorphism in the IGF-II gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> and impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects (n = 237) were independently recruited from three different populations in the Netherlands and Germany to allow independent replication of associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion were not significantly different between the various IGF-I or IGF-II genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, noncarriers of the IGF-I CA repeat allele had both a reduced insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and disposition index (DI), suggesting an altered balance between insulin secretion and insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related parameters were not significantly different for both the IGF-I and IGF-II gene variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that gene variants in the IGF-I and IGF-II genes are not associated with detectable variations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in these three independent populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to examine the exact contributions of the IGF-I CA repeat alleles to variations in ISI and DI </plain></SENT>
