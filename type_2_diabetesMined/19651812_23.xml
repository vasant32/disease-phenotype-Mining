<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have investigated genetic factors influencing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism among Indian Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We carried out genome-wide association studies for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in 5,089 nondiabetic Indian Asians genotyped with the Illumina Hap610 BeadChip and 2,385 Indian Asians (698 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) genotyped with the Illumina 300 BeadChip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with findings in 4,462 European Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> among Indian Asians at P &lt; 5 x 10(-8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> near <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptor MTNR1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most closely associated was rs2166706 (combined P = 2.1 x 10(-9)), which is in moderate linkage disequilibrium with rs1387153 (r(2) = 0.60) and rs10830963 (r(2) = 0.45), both previously associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in European Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk allele frequency and effect sizes for rs2166706 were similar among Indian Asians and European Caucasians: frequency 46.2 versus 45.0%, respectively (P = 0.44); effect 0.05 (95% CI 0.01-0.08) versus 0.05 (0.03-0.07 mmol/l), respectively, higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> per allele copy (P = 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNP rs2166706 was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Indian Asians (odds ratio 1.21 [95% CI 1.06-1.38] per copy of risk allele; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SNPs at the GCK, GCKR, and G6PC2 loci were also associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> among Indian Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk allele frequencies of rs1260326 (GCKR) and rs560887 (G6PC2) were higher among Indian Asians compared with European Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Common genetic variation near MTNR1B influences blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Indian Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation at the MTNR1B, GCK, GCKR, and G6PC2 loci may contribute to abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and related metabolic disturbances among Indian Asians </plain></SENT>
