<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the correlation of circadian rhythm disturbance including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> with the immune state in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (11 males and 8 females; aged 46-85 years) and 19 healthy controls (7 males and 12 males; aged 45-85 years) were recruited, and the presence of circadian rhythm disturbance including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> was examined using an actigraph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunological parameters were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances were more frequently noted in diabetic patients than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels were correlated with stronger sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of B lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, natural killer activity, and several cytokines were increased in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlations were shown among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> (circadian rhythm disturbance), immunological measures, and diabetic indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The exacerbation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was related to the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo>, circadian rhythm disturbance, and activation of the immune system </plain></SENT>
