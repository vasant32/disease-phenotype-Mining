<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound parameters of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were analyzed in relation to the genotype in 210 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ecNOS4a allele was detected in 34 (16.2%) of this study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the plaque count (P = 0.069), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other parameters obtained by ultrasound examination of carotid arteries were significantly correlated with presence of ecNOS4a allele (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the measured carotid parameters correlated well each other, we selected the total mean carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (intima-media thickness) value to be used for this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis including several variables such as age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, waist-hip ratio, and fasting insulin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> determined to be significant by univariate analysis, ecNOS4a allele had a significant correlation with total mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the ecNOS4a allele is associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients in Korea </plain></SENT>
