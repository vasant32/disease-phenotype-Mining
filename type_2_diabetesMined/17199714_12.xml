<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Growth hormone (GH) is generally considered to exert anti-insulin actions, whereas insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has insulin-like properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, GH deficient adults and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> are both predisposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, but one cannot extrapolate from these pathological conditions to determine the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metabolic roles of GH and IGF-I on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High doses of GH treatment have major effects on lipolysis, which plays a crucial role in promoting its anti-insulin effects, whereas IGF-I acts as an insulin sensitizer that does not exert any direct effect on lipolysis or lipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under physiological conditions, the insulin-sensitizing effect of IGF-I is only evident after feeding when the bioavailability of circulating IGF-I is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, many studies in GH deficient adults have consistently shown that GH replacement improves the body composition profile although these studies differ considerably in terms of age, the presence or absence of multiple pituitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599750" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hormone deficiency</z:e>, and whether GH deficiency was childhood or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the improvement in body composition does not necessarily translate into improvements in insulin sensitivity presumably due to the anti-insulin effects of high doses of GH therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More recently, we have found that a very low dose GH therapy (0.1 mg/day) improved insulin sensitivity without affecting body composition in GH-deficient adults and in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and we postulate that these effects are mediated by its ability to increase free 'bioavailable' IGF-I without the induction of lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results raise the possibility that this low GH dose may play a role in preventing the decline of beta-cell function and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these "high risk" subjects </plain></SENT>
