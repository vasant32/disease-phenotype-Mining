<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective community-based study, we tested whether the progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could be influenced by interventions in native Asian Indians with IGT who were younger, leaner and more insulin resistant than the above populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomised 531 (421 men 110 women) subjects with IGT (mean age 45.9+/-5.7 years, BMI 25.8+/-3.5 kg/m(2)) into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was the control, Group 2 was given advice on lifestyle modification (LSM), Group 3 was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET) and Group 4 was given LSM plus MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as diagnosed using World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 30 months, and the 3-year cumulative incidences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 55.0%, 39.3%, 40.5% and 39.5% in Groups 1-4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative risk reduction was 28.5% with LSM (95% CI 20.5-37.3, p=0.018), 26.4% with MET (95% CI 19.1-35.1, p=0.029) and 28.2% with LSM + MET (95% CI 20.3-37.0, p=0.022), as compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number needed to treat to prevent one incident case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6.4 for LSM, 6.9 for MET and 6.5 for LSM + MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Progression of IGT to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is high in native Asian Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both LSM and MET significantly reduced the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Asian Indians with IGT; there was no added benefit from combining them </plain></SENT>
