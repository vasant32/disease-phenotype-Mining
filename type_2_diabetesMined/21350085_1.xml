<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between breastfeeding duration and maternal adipokines at 3 years postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used linear regression to relate the duration of lactation to maternal leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY (PYY) at 3 years postpartum among 570 participants with 3-year postpartum blood samples (178 fasting), prospectively collected lactation history, and no intervening pregnancy in Project Viva, a cohort study of mothers and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 88% of mothers had initiated breastfeeding, 26% had breastfed ≥ 12 months, and 42% had exclusively breastfed for ≥ 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, we found that duration of total breastfeeding was directly related to PYY and ghrelin, and exclusive breastfeeding duration was directly related to ghrelin (predicted mean for never exclusively breastfeeding: 790.6 pg/mL vs. ≥ 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding: 1,008.1 pg/mL; P &lt; 0.01) at 3 years postpartum, adjusting for pregravid BMI, gestational <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, parity, smoking status, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a nonlinear pattern of association between exclusive breastfeeding duration and adiponectin in multivariate-adjusted models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort study, we found a direct relationship between the duration of lactation and both ghrelin and PYY at 3 years postpartum </plain></SENT>
