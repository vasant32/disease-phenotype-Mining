<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have also revealed the presence of the specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi>, perlecan, colocalized to islet amyloid deposits, similar to perlecan's known involvement with other amyloid proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, perlecan purified from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was used to define perlecan's interactions with amylin (i.e., islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>) and its effects on amylin fibril formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a solid phase-binding immunoassay, human amylin, but not rat amylin, bound immobilized EHS perlecan with a single dissociation constant (Kd) = 2.75 x 10(-6) mol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding of human amylin to perlecan was similarly observed using perlecan <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> (GAGs), and was completely abolished by 10 micromol/l <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using thioflavin T fluorometry, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> staining, and electron microscopy methodology, intact perlecan was found to enhance amylin fibril formation in a dosage-dependent manner, with the majority of these effects attributed to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> GAG chains of perlecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other sulfated GAGs and related macromolecules were also effective in the enhancement of amylin fibril formation in the order of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> &gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> &gt; chondroitin-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> = <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> = <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> &gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15447">pentosan</z:chebi> polysulfate, implicating the importance of the specific GAG/carbohydrate backbone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> content of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> was also important for the enhancement of amylin fibril formation in the order of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> &gt; N-desulfated N-acetylated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> &gt; completely desulfated N-sulfated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> &gt; completely desulfated N-acetylated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that the enhancement effects of perlecan on amylin fibril formation are mediated primarily by both specific GAG chain backbone and GAG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> content, and implicate perlecan as an important <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> that is likely involved in the pathogenesis of islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
