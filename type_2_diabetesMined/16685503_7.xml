<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to test whether serum resistin is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and markers of low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in elite athletes taken as a model of extreme insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 23 elite athletes (sprinters, middle-distance and marathon runners) and in 72 sedentary men including lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with NGT, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with IGT or new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we assessed insulin sensitivity using a whole-body insulin-sensitivity index (WBISI) derived from a 3-h OGTT; energy homeostasis was also assessed by means of indirect calorimetry, along with circulating adipokines and low-grade pro-inflammatory cyto-chemokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Professional athletes had increased WBISIs (p&lt;0.001) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation (p&lt;0.03); they also showed higher serum resistin concentrations (p&lt;0.001), although the pro-inflammatory chemokines were not increased in comparison with the other study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resistin was independently associated only with fasting plasma NEFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased resistin was detected in the middle-distance and marathon runners, but not in the sprinters when compared with the lean, young, sedentary individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Serum resistin concentration is increased in elite athletes, providing evidence against the notion that resistin levels reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans, as seen in animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased resistin was observed in aerobic-endurance, but not sustained-power athletes and this feature appeared to be independently associated with parameters of fatty acid metabolism </plain></SENT>
