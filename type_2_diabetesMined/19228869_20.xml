<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Both visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) have been linked to systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in nondiabetic cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationships between VAT and SAT and systemic inflammatory markers in a large well-characterized cohort of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three hundred eighty-two subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the CHICAGO (Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi>) study cohort underwent abdominal computed tomography to determine SAT and VAT distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood was obtained for measurement of inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationships between inflammatory markers and BMI, SAT, and VAT were examined using regression models adjusted for age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use, and A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VAT was positively related to CRP, monocyte chemoattractant protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>), intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen before adjustment for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for BMI, the relationship to CRP was lost but positive associations with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01), PAI-1 (P &lt; 0.0001), ICAM-1 (P &lt; 0.01), and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (P = 0.01) were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMI was positively related to CRP (P &lt; 0.0001) and IL-6 (P &lt; 0.01) even after adjustment for VAT and SAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SAT was not related to any inflammatory marker after adjustment for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large group of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BMI was most strongly associated with CRP and IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SAT was not associated with markers of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The size of the VAT depot provided information additional to that provided by BMI regarding inflammatory markers that are strongly related to vascular wall remodeling and coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that adipose tissue distribution remains an important determinant of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
