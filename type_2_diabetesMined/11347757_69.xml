<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential mechanisms for this association include apparent defects in fatty acid metabolism that are centered at the mitochondria in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, defects in the pathways for fatty acid oxidation during postabsorptive conditions are prominent, leading to diminished use of fatty acids and increased esterification and storage of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> within skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These impairments in fatty acid metabolism during fasting conditions may be related to a metabolic inflexibility in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> that is not limited to defects in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism during insulin-stimulated conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is substantial evidence implicating perturbations in fatty acid metabolism during accumulation of skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> by caloric restriction improves insulin sensitivity, but the effects on fatty acid metabolism are less conspicuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> decreases the content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> within skeletal muscle, perhaps contributing to the improvement in Insulin action with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alterations in skeletal muscle substrate metabolism provide insight into the link between skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and they may lead to more appropriate therapies to improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acid metabolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
