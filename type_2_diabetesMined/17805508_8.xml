<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000147'>Polycystic ovary</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are familial conditions sharing common features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on this, the aim of the present study was to establish whether variation in TCF7L2 also influences the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a genetic association study of variants of TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372) using both case-control and quantitative trait approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case-control analyses were conducted in (1) 369 PCOS cases and 2574 controls of UK British/Irish origin, and (2) 540 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> symptoms and 1083 controls from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative trait analyses (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> levels) were also performed (1249 individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no association between rs7903146 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> in the UK case-control study (Cochran-Armitage test, p = 0.51); nor with symptomatic status in the Finnish cohort (p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were no relationships between the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> levels (UK cases, p = 0.99; Finnish controls, p = 0.57; Finnish symptomatic cases, p = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results at rs12255372 were similar, reflecting strong linkage disequilibrium with rs7903146 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study was powered to detect an effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> susceptibility similar to that previously reported for these variants on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Failure to detect any evident association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> provides the strongest evidence yet that the genetic architecture of these related conditions is qualitatively distinct </plain></SENT>
