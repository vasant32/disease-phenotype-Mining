<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of erythrocytes on ET-1 synthesis was dependent on glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ET-1 levels after incubation with erythrocytes derived from patients with HbA(1c) levels &lt;6% were just half the levels observed after incubation with erythrocytes from patients with HbA(1c) levels &gt;8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>)-containing protein isolated from patients' erythrocytes induced ET-1, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-containing protein-dependent ET-1 induction was blocked by the recombinant decoy <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which comprises the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal Ig domain of the receptor for AGEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro-generated AGEs induced ET-1 mRNA transcription (nuclear run-on assay and Northern blot) in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient transfection of BAECs with a chimeric construct containing the 5' promoter region of the ET-1 gene linked to a reporter gene confirmed that AGE induced ET-1 promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed AGE-inducible binding of members of the nuclear factor-kappab (NF-kappaB) family to a potential binding site at -2,090 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Binding was functionally significant because overexpression of the cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappaB or deletion of the NF-kappaB binding site reduced ET-1 induction, whereas overexpression of NF-kappaB p65 induced ET-1 even in the absence of AGEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, ET-1 transcription is controlled by the AGE-inducible redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
