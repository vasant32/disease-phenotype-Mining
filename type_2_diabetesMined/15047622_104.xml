<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of IL-6 in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we examined the effects of IL-6 treatment on whole-body insulin action and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in vivo during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in awake mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of IL-6 blunted insulin's ability to suppress hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity in liver </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found that co-treatment of IL-10, a predominantly anti-inflammatory cytokine, prevented IL-6-induced defects in hepatic insulin action and signaling activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, IL-10 co-treatment protected skeletal muscle from IL-6 and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-induced defects in insulin action and signaling activity, and these effects were associated with decreases in intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37554">fatty acyl-CoA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to demonstrate that inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 alter hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin action in vivo, and the mechanism may involve cytokine-induced alteration in intracellular fat contents </plain></SENT>
