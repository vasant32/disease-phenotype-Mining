<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this association holds true in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and is independent of renal function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> is not clear at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective, observational study, 758 untreated hypertensive patients were evaluated at baseline and followed-up for 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 8,332 person-years of follow-up revealed that slightly elevated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels (i.e., ≥318 μmol/l for women and ≥420 μmol/l for men) at baseline were associated with a significantly higher risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio 3.65 [95% CI 1.99-6.69], P &lt; 0.0001), even after adjustment for several confounding factors such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (2.78 [1.35-5.70], P = 0.0054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">Uric acid</z:chebi> is an independent predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
