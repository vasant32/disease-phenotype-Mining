<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The intake of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> was studied for its ability to predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 2,285 men and 2,019 women 40-69 years of age and free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline (1967-1972) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Food consumption during the previous year was estimated using a dietary history interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intake of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, four <z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherols</z:chebi>, four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33235">tocotrienols</z:chebi>, and six <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoids</z:chebi> was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a 23-year follow-up, a total of 164 male and 219 female incident cases occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vitamin E intake was significantly associated with a reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative risk (RR) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between the extreme quartiles of the intake was 0.69 (95% CI 0.51-0.94, P for trend = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intakes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18185">gamma-tocopherol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47772">delta-tocopherol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33275">beta-tocotrienol</z:chebi> were inversely related to a risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among single <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10362">beta-cryptoxanthin</z:chebi> intake was significantly associated with a reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.78, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association was evident between intake of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be reduced by the intake of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in the diet </plain></SENT>
