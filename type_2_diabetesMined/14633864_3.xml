<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In gene expression studies of tissue biopsies from nondiabetic Pima Indians, IRS1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were reduced in adipocytes from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects compared with lean subjects, and IRS1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were also reduced in skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant subjects compared with insulin-sensitive subjects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on these expression differences and the known physiologic role of IRS1, this gene was investigated as a candidate gene for susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians, a population with an extremely high incidence and prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen variants were identified, and among these variants, several were in complete linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four genotypically unique variants were further genotyped in 937 DNA samples from full-heritage Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the variants were modestly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05), one of which was additionally associated with 2-h plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as well as insulin action at physiologic and maximally stimulating insulin concentrations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of variants in IRS1 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related phenotypes and the differential expression of IRS1 in adipocytes and skeletal muscle suggest a role of this gene in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
