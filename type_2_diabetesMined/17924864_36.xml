<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> can be excessive, adversely affecting cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spectre of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> can increase diabetic morbidity and mortality when it acts as a psychological barrier to the initiation or intensification of insulin, or affects adherence with prescribed regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> may result from a reduction of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to levels below the renal threshold without a compensatory reduction in calorie intake, a defensive or unconscious increase in calorie intake caused by the fear or experience of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, or the 'unphysiological' pharmacokinetic and metabolic profiles that follow subcutaneous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is, however, scope for limiting insulin-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strategies include limiting dose by increasing insulin sensitivity through diet and exercise or by using adjunctive anorectic or insulin-sparing pharmacotherapies such as pramlintide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin replacement regimens that attempt to mimic physiological norms should also enable insulin to be dosed with maximum efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The novel acylated analogue, insulin detemir, appears to lack the usual propensity for causing <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying this property might help clarify the mechanisms linking insulin with weight regulation </plain></SENT>
