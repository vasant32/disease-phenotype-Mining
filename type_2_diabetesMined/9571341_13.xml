<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) among a population of native Hawaiians in two rural communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> was assessed in two rural communities by history (confirmed by record review) or with a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test according to World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric and demographic data were also obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A short survey was used to estimate the prevalence of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among nonparticipants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence rates were adjusted using the standard world population of Segi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 574 native Hawaiians age &gt; or = 30 years participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The crude prevalence of IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 15.5 and 20.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only IGT prevalence was significantly higher (P = 0.03) among women (18.7%) than among men (10.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> was significantly associated with BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and BMI, waist circumference and WHR were significantly and independently associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence only among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not significantly associated with the percentage of Hawaiian ancestry after adjusting for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study observed a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> associated with being overweight among native Hawaiians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was four times higher than among the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was high despite high rates of admixture with other ethnic groups of Hawaii, suggesting that these other Asian and Pacific Island populations share similar susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
