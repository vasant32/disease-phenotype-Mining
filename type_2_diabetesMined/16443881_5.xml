<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fibrinogen production is increased both in the postabsorptive state and in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No data exist on the rate of albumin synthesis and its response to insulin in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured fractional synthesis rates (FSRs) and absolute synthesis rates (ASRs) of both albumin and fibrinogen in postabsorptive normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients at their spontaneous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (study A), as well as albumin FSR and ASR before and after a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic euaminoacidemic clamp (study B), using leucine isotope methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In postabsorptive type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (study A), albumin FSR (11.2 +/- 0.9%/day) and albumin ASR (15.4 +/- 1.2 g/day) were not different from control values (albumin FSR: 9.4 +/- 0.7%/day; albumin ASR: 13.8 +/- 1.2 g/day, P &gt; 0.1 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the type 2 diabetic subjects, both fibrinogen FSR (24.9 +/- 2.1%/day) and ASR (2.4 +/- 0.2 g/day) were greater (P &lt; 0.025 and P &lt; 0.007, respectively) compared with the control subjects (FSR: 18.6 +/- 1.51%/day; ASR: 1.6 +/- 0.2 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Worse metabolic control in the type 2 diabetic patients was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> and increased leucine rate of appearance, whereas neither the (increased) fibrinogen ASR nor the (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) albumin production was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In study B, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> (raised to approximately 860 nmol/l), albumin FSR and ASR increased by approximately 25% versus basal (P &lt; 0.04) and to the same extent in both type 2 diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, postabsorptive albumin synthesis and its response to insulin were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas fibrinogen synthesis was increased, irrespective of metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity with respect to albumin production but a selective hepatic dysregulation of fibrinogen metabolism were present </plain></SENT>
