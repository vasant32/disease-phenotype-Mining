<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the effect on insulin action and key proteins in skeletal muscle, and the necessary volume of strength training is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 type 2 diabetic subjects and 7 healthy men (control subjects) strength-trained one leg three times per week for 6 weeks while the other leg remained untrained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each session lasted no more than 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After strength training, muscle biopsies were obtained, and an isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with arterio-femoral venous catheterization of both legs was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, qualitatively similar responses were obtained in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the clamp, leg blood flow was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in trained versus untrained legs, but despite this, arterio-venous extraction <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not decrease in trained legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance was increased in trained legs (P &lt; 0.05) and more than explained by increases in muscle mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strength training increased protein content of GLUT4, insulin receptor, protein kinase B-alpha/beta, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase (GS), and GS total activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found that strength training for 30 min three times per week increases insulin action in skeletal muscle in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adaptation is attributable to local contraction-mediated mechanisms involving key proteins in the insulin signaling cascade </plain></SENT>
