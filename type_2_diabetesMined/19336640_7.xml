<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have high risk of late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, yet little is known about strategies to modify risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Targeting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and vascular complications-both associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>-may be a productive approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether dietary fat, which modulates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, might influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in older adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Beginning in 1995-1999, we evaluated cognitive function in 1,486 Nurses' Health Study participants, aged &gt;or=70 years, with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; second evaluations were conducted 2 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary fat intake was assessed regularly beginning in 1980; we considered average intake from 1980 (at midlife) through initial cognitive interview and also after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used multivariate-adjusted linear regression models to obtain mean differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> across tertiles of fat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher intakes of saturated and trans fat since midlife, and lower polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio, were each highly associated with worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in these women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On a global score averaging <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cognitive tests, mean decline among women in the highest trans fat tertile was 0.15 standard units worse than that among women in the lowest tertile (95% CI -0.24 to -0.06, P = 0.002); this mean difference was comparable with the difference we find in women 7 years apart in age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were similar when we analyzed diet after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lower intakes of saturated and trans fat and higher intake of polyunsaturated fat relative to saturated fat may reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
