<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A low serum adiponectin is also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, hepcidin was identified as a regulator of iron metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether serum adiponectin was associated with serum ferritin or prohepcidin, a precursor of hepcidin, in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 65 healthy subjects and 104 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A serum ferritin concentration ≥ 300 ng/ml for men or ≥ 150 ng/ml for women was defined as hyperferritinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin was significantly higher and serum prohepcidin was significantly lower in diabetic patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin correlated negatively with serum ferritin in control subjects or diabetic patients, while serum total and HMW adiponectin correlated positively with serum prohepcidin in diabetic patients, but not in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum total and HMW adiponectin were lower in patients with hyperferritinemia than in those without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, serum ferritin was increased in type 2 diabetic patients, while serum prohepcidin was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high serum ferritin was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and with low serum total and HMW adiponectin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
