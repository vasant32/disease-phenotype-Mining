<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using PTP1B antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), effects of decreased PTP1B levels on insulin signaling in diabetic ob/ob mice were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin stimulation, prior to sacrifice, resulted in no significant activation of insulin signaling pathways in livers from ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in PTP1B ASO-treated mice, in which PTP1B protein was decreased by 60% in liver, similar stimulation with insulin resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR and IR substrate (IRS)-1 and -2 by threefold, fourfold, and threefold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IRS-2-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity was also increased threefold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase B (PKB) serine phosphorylation was increased sevenfold in liver of PTP1B ASO-treated mice upon insulin stimulation, while phosphorylation of PKB substrates, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase (GSK)-3alpha and -3beta, was increased more than twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral insulin signaling was increased by PTP1B ASO, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of PKB in muscle of insulin-stimulated PTP1B ASO-treated animals despite the lack of measurable effects on muscle PTP1B protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that reduction of PTP1B is sufficient to increase insulin-dependent metabolic signaling and improve insulin sensitivity in a diabetic animal model </plain></SENT>
