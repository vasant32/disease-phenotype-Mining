<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major goal of maintaining glycemia at ∼ 5 mM is to ensure a sufficient flux of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to the brain, which depends mostly on this nutrient as a source of metabolic energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This homeostatic process is controlled by hormones, mainly glucagon and insulin, and by autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> activities that control the metabolic state of liver, muscle and fat tissue but also the secretory activity of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation or inhibition of the sympathetic or parasympathetic branches of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems are controlled by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-excited or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-inhibited neurons located at different anatomical sites, mainly in the brainstem and the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of these neurons by hyper- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> represents a critical aspect of the control of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, and loss of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing by these cells as well as by pancreatic β-cells is a hallmark of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, aspects of the brain-<z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreas axis are reviewed, highlighting the importance of central <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing in the control of counterregulation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> but also mentioning the role of the neural control in β-cell mass and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the conclusions of these studies is that impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, such as associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but also defective counterregulation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, may be caused by initial defects in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing </plain></SENT>
