<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed to what extent a reduction in eGFR in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predicts 11-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality, independently of AER and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population was the population-based cohort (n = 1,538; median age 68.9 years) of the Casale Monferrato Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GFR was estimated by the abbreviated Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> Study equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (eGFR &lt;60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) was 34.3% (95% CI 33.0-36.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 670 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 10,708 person-years of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios of 1.23 (95% CI 1.03-1.47) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and 1.18 (95% CI 0.92-1.52) for cardiovascular mortality were observed after adjusting for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and AER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When five levels of eGFR were analysed we found that most risk was conferred by eGFR 15-29 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), whereas no increased risk was evident in people with eGFR values between 30 and 59 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an analysis stratified by AER categories, a significant increasing trend in risk with decreasing eGFR was evident only in people with macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> macroalbuminuria is the main predictor of mortality, independently of both eGFR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, whereas eGFR provides no further information in normoalbuminuric people </plain></SENT>
