<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-group study investigated the potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> add-on therapy for improving the glycaemic control of overweight patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and was inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> titrated up to 100 mg three times daily (n=74) or placebo (n=78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 850 mg twice or thrice daily before the study and continued to receive this dose throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean difference in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) (+/-S.D.) from baseline to endpoint was -0.7+/-1.2% U in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> intention-to-treat (ITT) group, compared with +0.2+/-1.3% in the placebo ITT group (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly, more patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group were classified as 'responders', with an HbA(1c) at the end of treatment of less than 7.0% or a decrease by at least 15% relative to baseline (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> vs. placebo; 42 vs. 17%; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level from baseline to endpoint was -1.0+/-2.8 (S.D.) mmol/l in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> ITT group, compared with +1.3+/-2.8 mmol/l in the placebo ITT group (P=0.0001), and for 2-h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level -1.4+/-3.8 vs. +1.1+/-3.5 mmol/l (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 60% of patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group and 33% in the placebo group had an adverse event considered to be possibly or probably related to drug therapy, leading to withdrawal by 15 and 3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> has potential clinical utility for improving glycaemic control in overweight patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
