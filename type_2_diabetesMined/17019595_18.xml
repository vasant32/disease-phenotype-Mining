<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and short-term exercise training on whole-body insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and signal transduction along the canonical insulin signalling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp, with vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsies, was performed at baseline and 16 h after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> bout of exercise and short-term exercise training (7 days) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic (n=7) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic (n=8) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was unchanged following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exercise in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-term exercise training increased insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic (p&lt;0.05), but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin activation of (1) IRS1, (2) IRS2, (3) phosphotyrosine-associated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity and (4) the substrate of phosphorylated Akt, AS160, a functional Rab GTPase activating protein important for GLUT4 (now known as solute carrier family 2 [facilitated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter], member 4 [SLC2A4]) translocation, was unchanged after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GLUT4 protein content was increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects (p&lt;0.05), but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic subjects following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Exercise training increased whole-body insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes were independent of functional alterations in the insulin-signalling cascade and related to increased GLUT4 protein content </plain></SENT>
