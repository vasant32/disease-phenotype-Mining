<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 24 nonobese first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients and 12 control subjects at rest and 48 h after three bouts of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to measurements of oxygen uptake and insulin sensitivity (oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test), ectopic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP synthesis were assessed using(1)H and(31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were genotyped for polymorphisms in genes regulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function, PPARGC1A (rs8192678) and NDUFB6 (rs540467) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relatives had slightly lower (P = 0.012) insulin sensitivity than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, ATP synthase flux rose by 18% (P = 0.0001), being 23% higher (P = 0.002) than that in relatives after exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relatives responding to exercise training with increased ATP synthesis (+19%, P = 0.009) showed improved insulin sensitivity (P = 0.009) compared with those whose insulin sensitivity did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism in the NDUFB6 gene from respiratory chain complex I related to ATP synthesis (P = 0.02) and insulin sensitivity response to exercise training (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATP synthase flux correlated with O(2)uptake and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ability of short-term exercise to stimulate ATP production distinguished individuals with improved insulin sensitivity from those whose insulin sensitivity did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the NDUFB6 gene polymorphism appeared to modulate this adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function contribute to the response of ATP synthesis to exercise training </plain></SENT>
