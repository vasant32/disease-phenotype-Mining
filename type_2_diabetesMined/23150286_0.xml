<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Few studies are currently available regarding the influence of sleep duration on glycemic control in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to examine the relationship between sleep duration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and the glycemic level in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 4,870 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients aged â‰¥20 years were divided into six groups according to their self-reported sleep duration: less than 4.5 h, 4.5-5.4 h, 5.5-6.4 h, 6.5-7.4 h, 7.5-8.4 h, and more than 8.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations of sleep duration with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the HbA(1c) levels were examined in a cross-sectional manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The HbA(1c) levels showed a quadratic association with sleep duration; namely, a shorter or longer sleep duration was associated with a higher level compared with a sleep duration of 6.5-7.4 h (P for quadratic trend &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders, including the total energy intake and depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, additional adjustments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, which also showed a U-shaped relationship with sleep duration, did not attenuate the U-shaped sleep-HbA(1c) association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction between sleep duration and age or the use of insulin was observed for the HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Sleep duration was shown to have U-shaped associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the HbA(1c) levels in type 2 diabetic patients, independent of potential confounders, and therefore may be an important modifiable factor for the clinical management of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
