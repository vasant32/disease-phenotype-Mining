<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Variation in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been shown to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined variation in a 0.1-Mb region surrounding marker DG10S478 for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits in 132 Mexican-American families of a proband with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study participants were phenotyped by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan for percentage of body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 42 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped, 15 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On univariate analysis, none of the SNPs showed association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, rs12255372 showed association with 30' Deltainsulin (OGTT 30' min fasting insulin) in an interaction with percentage of body fat (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> to increase 30' Deltainsulin was greater in subjects with the T allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This interaction was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>rs12255372 also showed an association with beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> based on 30' Deltainsulin in an interaction with percentage of body fat (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>rs12255372 was also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] 2.49 [95% CI 1.17-5.31]; P = 0.018) in our case-control sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that variation in TCF7L2 is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and interacts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> to alter insulin secretion in Mexican Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our observations partly explain the increased ORs observed in previous associated studies when analyses were restricted to lean subjects and the variability in quantitative trait association results </plain></SENT>
