<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is frequently suboptimal in primary care settings, where providers often fail to intensify therapy when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels are high, a problem known as clinical inertia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We asked whether interventions targeting clinical inertia can improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A controlled trial over a 3-year period was conducted in a municipal hospital primary care clinic in a large academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (4,138) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were seen in continuity clinics by 345 internal medicine residents and were randomized to be control subjects or to receive one of three interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instead of consultative advice, the interventions were hard copy computerized reminders that provided patient-specific recommendations for management at the time of each patient's visit, individual face-to-face feedback on performance for 5 min every 2 weeks, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over an average patient follow-up of 15 months within the intervention site, improvements in and final HbA1c (A1C) with feedback + reminders (deltaA1C 0.6%, final A1C 7.46%) were significantly better than control (deltaA1C 0.2%, final A1C 7.84%, P &lt; 0.02); changes were smaller with feedback only and reminders only (P = NS vs. control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trends were similar but not significant with systolic blood pressure (sBP) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that the feedback intervention independently facilitated attainment of American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association goals for both A1C and sBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over a 2-year period, overall glycemic control improved in the intervention site but did not change in other primary care sites (final A1C 7.5 vs. 8.2%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Feedback on performance aimed at overcoming clinical inertia and given to internal medicine resident primary care providers improves glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Partnering generalists with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specialists may be important to enhance <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management in other primary care settings </plain></SENT>
