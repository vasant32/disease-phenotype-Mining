<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The gene encoding the alpha2 Heremans-Schmid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AHSG) is a credible biological and positional candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and previous attempts to relate AHSG variation with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Swedish and French Caucasians have been largely successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We related seven frequent AHSG tag single nucleotide polymorphisms to a range of metabolic traits, including type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The polymorphisms were genotyped in 7,683 white Danish subjects using Taqman allelic discrimination or chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, providing a statistical power of &gt;99% to replicate previous findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed in case-control and haplotype settings, and quantitative metabolic traits were examined for association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, epistatic effects between AHSG variants and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) and beta-2-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The -469T&gt;G (rs2077119) and IVS6+98C&gt;T (rs2518136) polymorphisms were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.007 and P = 0.006, respectively, or P(corr) = 0.04 and P(corr) = 0.03, respectively, following correction for multiple hypothesis testing), and in a combined analysis of the present and a previous study -469T&gt;G remained significant (odds ratio 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.97]; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two AHSG haplotypes were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (P = 0.003 and P(corr) = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thr248Met (rs4917) tended to associate with lower fasting and post-oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test serum insulin release (P = 0.02, P(corr) = 0.1 for fasting and P = 0.04, P(corr) = 0.2 for area under the insulin curve) and improved insulin sensitivity estimated by the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (9.0 vs. 8.6 mmol x l(-1) x pmol(-1) x l(-1); P = 0.01, P(corr) = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indications of epistatic effects of AHSG variants with the IRS1 Gly971Arg polymorphism were observed for fasting serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on present and previous findings, common variation in AHSG may contribute to the interindividual variation in metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
