<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to characterize both vascular production and the enzymatic source of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the thoracic aorta of OLETF rats, endothelium-dependent relaxation was markedly attenuated compared with that of control (LETO) rats in association with a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production (2,421.39 +/- 407.01 nmol x min(-1) x mg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> was significantly attenuated by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI; 10 micromol/l), an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> as a substrate was markedly increased in the vascular homogenates, but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi>, and succinate produced only small increases in chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In line with these results, studies using various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>, such as DPI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">rotenone</z:chebi>, N(G)-monomethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, suggest that the predominant source of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> in vascular particulate fraction is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-dependent membrane-bound oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of p22phox, a major component of vascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase, was markedly increased in the aorta from OLETF rats compared with that of LETO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that upregulated expression of p22phox <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> oxidase activity contribute to the impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
