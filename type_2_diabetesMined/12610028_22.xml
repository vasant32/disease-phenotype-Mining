<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the association of work stress by high demands, low decision latitude, and job strain (combination of high demands and low decision latitude) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied low sense of coherence (SOC) (a factor for successful coping with stressors) in association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, we investigated the combination of SOC and demands or SOC and decision latitude in association with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 4821 healthy Swedish women (aged 35-56 years) residing in five municipalities in the Stockholm area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test identified 52 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were estimated in a logistic multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No association was found between high demands and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR 1.1 [CI 0.5-2.2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low decision latitude was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a RR of 2.2 (1.0-4.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RR of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with low SOC was 3.7 (1.2-11.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of low SOC and low decision latitude was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a RR of 2.6 (1.2-5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment revealed an association of 4.2 (1.2-15.0) between low SOC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provided new evidence that stress factors such as low decision latitude at work and low SOC were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged Swedish women </plain></SENT>
