<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric structure consisting of two alpha-subunits of Mr 135 kilodalton on the outside of the plasma membrane connected by disulphide bonds to beta-subunits of Mr 95 kilodalton which are transmembrane proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin binding to the alpha-subunit induces conformational changes which are transduced to the beta-subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This leads to the activation of a tyrosine kinase activity which is intrinsic to the cytoplasmatic domains of the beta-subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor represents an essential step in the transduction of an insulin signal across the plasma membrane of target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signal transduction on the post-kinase level is not yet understood in detail, possible mechanisms involve phosphorylation of substrate proteins at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi>, activation of serine kinases, the interaction with G-proteins, phospholipases and phosphatidylinositol kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies in multiple insulin-resistant cell models have demonstrated that an impaired response of the tyrosine kinase to insulin stimulation is one potential mechanism causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An impairment of the insulin effect on tyrosine kinase activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major target tissues of insulin, in particular the skeletal muscle was demonstrated in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence that the impaired tyrosine kinase response in the skeletal muscle is a primary defect, however, it is likely that this abnormality of insulin signal transduction contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the insulin-resistant state in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
