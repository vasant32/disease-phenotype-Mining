<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: prospective observational study involving 119 DM2 patients without history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> admitted with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical history, anthropometrics, smoking, HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, troponine-I levels, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) was measured 1 month after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for 36 months or to reach an end-point: cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary event, angioplasty or hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To facilitate analysis, patients were divided into two groups according to cf-PWV, using the accepted cut-off value of 12m/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: overall, 34 patients had a recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Kaplan-Meier analysis patients with cf-PWV&gt;12m/s had mean time-to-event 353±43 days compared to 505±115 days for patients with cf-PWV≤12m/s, log rank=0.0252 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis factors independently associated with recurrence were age (66.53±6.87 vs. 61.54±10.77 years, p=0.015), LVEF (41.66±8.21 vs. 47.58±8.11%, p=0.001) and cf-PWV (13.94±2.91 vs. 12.35±2.77m/s, p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AS estimation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> discriminate patients at higher risk for 3-year recurrence, and maybe valuable for distinguishing patients likely to require a more rigorous therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
