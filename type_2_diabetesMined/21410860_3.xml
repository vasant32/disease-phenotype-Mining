<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of insulin pharmacology studies are conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At present, there are more patients with type 2 than type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the responsibility for initiating insulin therapy in these patients continues to shift to primary care, it will be important for general practitioners to understand the different pharmacological properties of insulin preparations in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, so that treatment can be adapted to meet patients' physiological and lifestyle requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to summarize pharmacological studies of insulin analogues in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Faster <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action of rapid acting insulin analogues has improved postprandial glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biphasic insulin analogues are associated with a lower incidence of nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> compared with human biphasic preparations and allow for intensification from once to twice or thrice daily dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More predictable glycaemic-lowering profiles of the insulin analogues have also led to reductions in nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, particularly comparing long-acting insulin analogues with protaminated human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enhancing insulin self-association and reversible binding with albumin has led to further reductions in variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, improvements can still be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Effective once daily clinical dosing of long-acting insulin analogues is not possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the protaminated component of biphasic insulin analogues do not provide the duration of action or profile for physiological basal insulin replacement and neither insulin glargine nor insulin detemir are suitable for mixing with other insulin analogues as this would substantially alter their pharmacokinetic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Enhancing the pharmacological predictability and extending the duration of action could simplify insulin titration and further reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
