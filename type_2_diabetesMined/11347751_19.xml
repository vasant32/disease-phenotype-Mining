<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In some studies, fasting and postload glycemia are a strong predictor of coronary events and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the relationship between fasting and postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and coronary status in 363 men referred for coronary arteriography without a previous history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 363 men (mean age 53.0 +/- 9.1 years, mean BMI 27.9 +/- 3.7 kg/m2) with positive results of exercise testing were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standard oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin estimations was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and HbA1c were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were divided into four groups, according to coronary status: no changes in coronary arteries (group 0, n = 61), one-vessel disease (group 1, n = 113), two-vessel disease (group II, n = 116), and three-vessel disease (group III, n = 73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were observed in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, insulin concentrations and HbA1c increased with the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on results of the OGTT, 16% of the patients (n = 59) fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 36% of the patients (n = 131) met criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were observed between the number of involved vessels and postload glycemia, HbA1c, fasting insulin, and postload insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that age, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> independently correlated with the number of involved vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with advanced changes in the coronary arteries experience more pronounced metabolic disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postload glycemia could be an important predictor of nondiagnosed disturbances of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
