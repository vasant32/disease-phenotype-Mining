<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Surveys in northern Ethiopia have demonstrated that apparent type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurs more frequently than elsewhere in Africa and, indeed, in other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated in detail a cohort of diabetic patients from this region to clarify the nature of this type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients attending the diabetic clinic at Mekelle Hospital in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia were investigated over a 6 week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, demographic and anthropometric data were collected, as well as measurements of HbA(1c), fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and serum markers of beta cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, i.e. islet antigen-2 and GAD antibodies (GADA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 105 patients seen, 69 (66%) were on insulin treatment and had been from or close to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their median age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration were 30 and 5 years, respectively, with a male excess of 2:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median BMI was 20.6 kg/m² </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite these clinical characteristics suggestive of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, only 42 of 69 (61%) patients were C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-negative and 35% GADA-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 38 (36%) of the total group (n = 105) had immunological or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> characteristics inconsistent with typical type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics, local prevalence of undernutrition, and GADA and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> suggest a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>-related form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in northern Ethiopia with apparent type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appear to have the form of disease seen in Europids; their disease may, in fact, be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
