<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to investigate whether changes in endothelium-dependent vasodilation, a marker of endothelial function, were related to serum AGEs concentrations in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For this study, 170 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 83 healthy nondiabetic control subjects of similar age were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum AGEs were assayed by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation of the brachial artery was measured by high-resolution vascular ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum AGEs were increased in diabetic patients compared with control subjects (4.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.8 unit/ml; P &lt; 0.01), and both endothelium-dependent (5.1 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.1 +/- 4.1%; P &lt; 0.01) and endothelium-independent vasodilation (13.2 +/- 4.6 vs. 16.4 +/- 5.5%; P &lt; 0.01) were impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, serum AGEs correlated with endothelium-dependent vasodilation (r = -0.51, P &lt; 0.01); a weaker association was found with endothelium-independent vasodilation (r = -0.24, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multiple regression analyses including age, sex, smoking status, and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, only serum AGEs remained a significant independent determinant of endothelium-dependent vasodilation (r(2) = 0.34, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum concentrations of AGEs in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, independent of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies to determine whether treatment targeting AGEs will lead to an amelioration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> are warranted </plain></SENT>
