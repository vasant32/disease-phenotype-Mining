<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used Swedish <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (SOS) to explore long-term outcomes in noneligible versus eligible patients.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThe SOS study involved 2,010 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients who underwent bariatric surgery (68% vertical-banded gastroplasty, 19% banding, and 13% gastric bypass) and 2,037 contemporaneously matched <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls receiving usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At inclusion, the participant age was 37-60 years and BMI was ≥34 kg/m(2) in men and ≥38 kg/m(2) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of surgery was assessed in patients that do (n = 3,814) and do not (n = 233) meet current eligibility criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The date of analysis was 1 January 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up time was up to 20 years, with a median of 10 years.RESULTSCardiovascular risk factors were significantly improved both in noneligible and eligible individuals after 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery reduced the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in both the noneligible (adjusted hazard ratio 0.33 [95% CI 0.13-0.82], P = 0.017) and eligible (0.27 [0.22-0.33], P &lt; 0.001) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could not detect a difference in the effect of surgery between the groups (adjusted interaction P value = 0.713).CONCLUSIONSBariatric surgery drastically reduced the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> both in noneligible and eligible patients and improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that strict BMI cutoffs are of limited use for bariatric surgery prioritization if the aim is to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
