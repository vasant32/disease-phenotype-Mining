<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen subjects were treated with oral agents, eight with a combination of insulin and oral agents, and seven with insulin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects ingested the study bar (Extend Bar, containing 30 g of total carbohydrate, including 5 g of uncooked cornstarch, 3 g protein, and 3 g fat) for three evenings followed by a placebo bar for 3 evenings (30 g of total carbohydrate, 3 g protein, and 3 g fat), or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-snack before bedtime, midnight and before breakfast finger stick blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were compared to determine the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (&lt;60 mg/dl), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (&gt;250 mg/dl), and to calculate any differences in the group's mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels when ingesting the study versus the placebo bar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels pre-snack at bedtime were nearly identical (Extend Bar value 117.5+/-45.6 mg/dl; placebo bar value 117.3+/-40.0 mg/dl; P=0.977), and lower at midnight and before breakfast on the Extend Bar nights compared to the placebo bar nights (Extend Bar, midnight value 127.9+/-31.0 mg/dl; placebo bar midnight value 148.2+/-32.1 mg/dl; P=0.0001; Extend Bar breakfast value 114.2+/-15.8 mg/dl; placebo bar breakfast value 158.49+/-30.3 mg/dl; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ingesting Extend Bar containing uncooked cornstarch as the nighttime snack may be an effective strategy to lesson the frequency of nocturnal and morning <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
