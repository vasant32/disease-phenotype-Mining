<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the findings of a 10-week, double-blind, parallel, placebo controlled, randomised trial with repaglinide in 25 diet-treated, sulphonylurea-na√Øve patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide was titrated, based on capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, from 0.5 mg to a maximum of 4 mg, preprandially with breakfast and dinner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 10 weeks, repaglinide was associated with a decrease in HbA(1c) of 2.3%Hb relative to the placebo group (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This reflected a 30% decrease within the repaglinide group from a mean HbA(1c) of 7.0 to 4.9%Hb (P&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide was also associated with a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, by 0.88 mmol/l, relative to placebo (P&lt;0.001), with a 20% decrease (from 3.80 to 3.04 mmol/l) within the repaglinide group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations decreased in association with repaglinide by 3.6 and 6.4 mmol/l, respectively, relative to placebo (P&lt;0.001 in each case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the repaglinide group fasting and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased by 3.9 and 6.2 mmol/l, respectively (P&lt;0.001 in each case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of patients reporting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in the repaglinide group was similar to placebo (15 vs. 20, respectively; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Test meal assessments confirmed that repaglinide effectively controls <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels by stimulating mealtime insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum insulin concentration was not raised compared to baseline or placebo during repaglinide therapy, albeit that fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were decreased by repaglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twice-daily meal-related insulin secretagogue therapy with repaglinide, a new short and rapid-acting prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulator, is capable of improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of glycaemic control without increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
