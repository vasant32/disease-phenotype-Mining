<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 28-week parallel-group study randomized 233 insulin-naive patients with HbA(1c) values &gt;/=8.0% on &gt;1,000 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone or in combination with other OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was adjusted up to 2,550 mg/day before insulin therapy was initiated with 5-6 units BIAsp 70/30 twice daily or 10-12 units glargine at bedtime and titrated to target blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (80-110 mg/dl) by algorithm-directed titration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 209 subjects completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At study end, the mean HbA(1c) value was lower in the BIAsp 70/30 group than in the glargine group (6.91 +/- 1.17 vs. 7.41 +/- 1.24%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HbA(1c) reduction was greater in the BIAsp 70/30 group than in the glargine group (-2.79 +/- 0.11 vs. -2.36 +/- 0.11%, respectively; P &lt; 0.01), especially for subjects with baseline HbA(1c) &gt;8.5% (-3.13 +/- 1.63 vs. -2.60 +/- 1.50%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More BIAsp 70/30-treated subjects reached target HbA(1c) values than glargine-treated subjects (HbA(1c) &lt;/=6.5%: 42 vs. 28%, P &lt; 0.05; HbA(1c) &lt;7.0%: 66 vs. 40%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (episodes/year) was greater in the BIAsp 70/30 group than in the glargine group (3.4 +/- 6.6 and 0.7 +/- 2.0, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> and daily insulin dose at study end were greater for BIAsp 70/30-treated subjects than for glargine-treated subjects (<z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>: 5.4 +/- 4.8 vs. 3.5 +/- 4.5 kg, P &lt; 0.01; insulin dose: 78.5 +/- 39.5 and 51.3 +/- 26.7 units/day, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> poorly controlled on OADs, initiating insulin therapy with twice-daily BIAsp 70/30 was more effective in achieving HbA(1c) targets than once-daily glargine, especially in subjects with HbA(1c) &gt;8.5% </plain></SENT>
