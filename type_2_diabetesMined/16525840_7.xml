<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this population-based study was to compare the association of non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, ApoB and the ApoB:ApoA-I ratio with cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We assessed the association of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> with 11-year mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in the population-based cohort of the Casale Monferrato Study (1,565 people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; median age 68.9 years), and determined the effect of age (&lt; or =70 and &gt;70 years) on these relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the basis of 341 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in 10,809 person-years of observation, there was a decreasing trend in risk adjusted for multiple factors across quartiles of total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>- and non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> in people aged &gt;70 years, but no trend in those aged &lt; or =70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age did not affect the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoB and ApoB:ApoA-I were associated with outcome in people in both age groups independently of non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for multiple factors, including non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, the hazard ratios for ApoB:ApoA-I in the upper vs lower quartile were 2.98 (95% CI 1.15-7.75; p for trend=0.009) for people aged &lt; or =70 years and 1.94 (95% CI 1.20-3.13; p for trend=0.003) for those aged &gt;70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this cohort of Mediterranean subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ApoB and the ApoB:ApoA-I ratio were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> mortality independently of non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the recommendation that ApoB and ApoA-I should be measured routinely in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in the elderly </plain></SENT>
