<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two follow-up studies were carried out to determine whether lower birthweight is related to the occurrence of syndrome X-Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first study included 407 men born in Hertfordshire, England between 1920 and 1930 whose weights at birth and at 1 year of age had been recorded by health visitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second study included 266 men and women born in Preston, UK, between 1935 and 1943 whose size at birth had been measured in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of syndrome X fell progressively in both men and women, from those who had the lowest to those who had the highest birthweights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 64-year-old men whose birthweights were 2.95 kg (6.5 pounds) or less, 22% had syndrome X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their risk of developing syndrome X was more than 10 times greater than that of men whose birthweights were more than 4.31 kg (9.5 pounds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between syndrome X and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> was independent of duration of gestation and of possible confounding variables including cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and social class currently or at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo>, subjects with syndrome X had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>small head circumference</z:hpo> and low ponderal index at birth, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low weight</z:hpo> and below-average dental eruption at 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> have a common origin in sub-optimal development in utero, and that syndrome X should perhaps be re-named "the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small-baby</z:e> syndrome" </plain></SENT>
