<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the prevalence and biochemical/hormonal determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in postmenopausal Chinese women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 890 postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 689 age-matched non-diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the total subjects included in both groups were classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI&lt; 25 kg/m²) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density (BMD) at the sites (lumbar spine, femoral neck, and hip), obtained by dual X-ray absorptiometry and some other relevant clinical and laboratory indices of bone mineral metabolism were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMDs, T- and Z-scores at the total hip, femoral neck and ward's triangle were significantly lower in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic women than those in BMI-matched control subjects (P &lt; 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> diabetic patients and control subjects had similar BMDs and T- and Z-scores at various skeletal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>Osteopenia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> was more common at the hip and femoral neck in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic women than in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic women and control subjects (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multiple linear regression analysis, which was adjusted for the <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> concentration, BMI, fasting insulin level, and serum osteocalcin were positively associated with BMDs at the hip and lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, mean HbA₁(c) levels, and NTx/Cr showed negative correlation (P &lt; 0.0284) with BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have lower BMD levels and higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> rate than BMI-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Impaired bone formation may occur in Chinese postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
