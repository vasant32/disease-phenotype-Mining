<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if insulin sensitivity is altered in prepubertal offspring exposed to a diabetic intrauterine environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen control children, 17 offspring of type 1 diabetic women, and 10 offspring of type 2 diabetic women, aged between 5 and 10 years, underwent a frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weight and height were measured, and body composition was calculated using bioelectrical impedance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bergman's minimal model was applied to the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin measurements to obtain values for insulin sensitivity (Si), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness (Sg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Si was lowest in the offspring of type 2 diabetic mothers, and AIR was highest in this group, although neither of these changes reached significance (Si, P = 0.2, and AIR, P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Offspring of type 2 diabetic mothers had higher BMI SD scores (P = 0.004) and percentage fat mass (P = 0.002) than the children in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BMI SD score and percentage fat mass in the subjects, as well as maternal insulin dose, were negatively correlated with offspring insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intrauterine exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> by itself was not associated with alterations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation in prepubertal offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Children of mothers with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, however, were overweight, and they had a tendency for a reduced Si </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined effect of genetic and postnatal environmental factors, rather than prenatal exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, may place this group at risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> in later life </plain></SENT>
