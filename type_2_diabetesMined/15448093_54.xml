<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only one study has adjusted for a detailed measure of insulin sensitivity (insulin sensitivity index [S(i)]), which is important given associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and S(i) with nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the associations of elevated AST and ALT with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among 906 participants in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study who were nondiabetic at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S(i) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) were measured directly from the frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test among black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white participants aged 40-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5.2 years, 148 individuals had developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline AST and ALT were positively correlated with fasting insulin (r = 0.22 and r = 0.35, respectively), waist circumference (r = 0.18 and r = 0.34), and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r = 0.13 and r = 0.29) and inversely with S(i) (r = -0.18 and r = -0.30; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In separate logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, clinical center, and alcohol consumption, participants in the highest quartiles (Q4) of AST and ALT were at significantly increased risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those in the lowest three quartiles (Q1-Q3): AST: odds ratio (OR) 1.73 (95% CI 1.17-2.57); ALT: OR 2.32 (1.36-3.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for smoking, waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, S(i), and AIR, both AST and ALT remained significantly associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: AST, Q4 vs. Q1-Q3: OR 1.98 (1.23-3.17); ALT, Q4 vs. Q1-Q3: OR 2.00 (1.22-3.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no interactions of sex, ethnicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, or S(i) with AST or ALT in the prediction of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When entered into the same model with adjustment for demographic variables, both C-reactive protein and ALT independently predicted type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, AST and ALT were positively associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after excluding former and moderate to heavy drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AST and ALT independently predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Baseline elevations of these markers may reflect NAFLD or related pathologies </plain></SENT>
