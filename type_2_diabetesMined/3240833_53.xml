<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1975 and 1986, from a study population of 5059 subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> occurred in 80 persons, 76 (95%) of whom had Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of the cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> indicated that among the diabetic subjects only two cases could be attributed to nondiabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cases were attributable to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In diabetic Pima Indians the incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> did not change during the study period, was similar in men and women, and was not effected by age at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or by attained age, but did increase significantly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> attributed to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> increased from 0 cases/1000 person-years at 0-5 years to 40.8 cases/1000 person-years at greater than or equal to 20 years duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> was similar to that in subjects with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were followed at the Joslin Clinic in Boston, Massachusetts when those with similar duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were compared </plain></SENT>
