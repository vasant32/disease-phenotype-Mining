<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a first series of experiments the in vitro effect of the drug was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results obtained showed that glipizide inhibits transglutaminase activity in human red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a second approach, glipizide was administered orally to six type 2 diabetic patients during 3 months, in order to evaluate the long-term effect upon transglutaminase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Again, glipizide induced a significant decrease in the enzyme activity in blood red cells (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with hypoglycemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> could improve insulin effects by inhibiting cellular transglutaminase activity </plain></SENT>
