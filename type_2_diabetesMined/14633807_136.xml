<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> who were randomized to either a usual care control group or an intensive lifestyle intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group received general dietary and exercise advice at baseline and had an annual physician's examination </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measures of glycemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>lipemia</z:mp> improved more in the intervention group </plain></SENT>
