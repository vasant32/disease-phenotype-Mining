<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out to determine the effect of sex and oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17263">oestrone</z:chebi> on body weight of 12-week-old female and male <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (fa/fa) rats initially weighing 350-380 g and 405-420 g, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were maintained in standard conditions and given a daily oral gavage of 0.2 ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17263">oestrone</z:chebi> dissolved in sunflower oil at a dose of 10 micromol/kg/day for 10 days, and their body weight and food intake was monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were then killed, and their carcass composition (water, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, protein and total energy), liver <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and plasma chemistry, insulin, free and total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17263">oestrone</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17263">oestrone</z:chebi> via gavage resulted in significant losses of fat, energy and-ultimately-weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17263">oestrone</z:chebi> decreased food intake; the energy expenditure was kept close to that of controls at the expense of internal fat stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, body protein and plasma metabolite homeostasis were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slimming effects were more marked in males than in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment increased circulating acyl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17263">oestrone</z:chebi> and reduced to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels the high insulin observed in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of genetically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats with a daily oral gavage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17263">oestrone</z:chebi> resulted in the loss of fat reserves with little modification of other metabolic parameters, except for lower plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17263">oestrone</z:chebi>, in addition to its slimming effects may be effective as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
