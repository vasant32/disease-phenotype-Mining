<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin is an oral incretin enhancer that acts to increase active levels of the incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) by inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme responsible for the rapid deactivation of GLP-1 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This activity results in improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent functioning of pancreatic islet beta and alpha cells, addressing two central deficits in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin treatment improves beta-cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, producing increased insulin secretory rate relative to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in both postprandial and fasting states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Improved alpha-cell function is shown as restoration of appropriate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-related suppression of glucagon and, therefore, reduced endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production during both postprandial and fasting periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that long-term vildagliptin treatment may slow underlying deterioration of beta-cell function in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is also a potential synergistic effect of vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in increasing active GLP-1 levels, and this activity may contribute to the long-term improvements in beta-cell function observed in patients with T2DM who have vildagliptin added to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin treatment has also been associated with beneficial extrapancreatic effects, including improved peripheral insulin sensitivity and improved postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement of beta- and alpha-cell function through incretin enhancement with vildagliptin results in more physiologic meal-related and fasting glycaemia profiles </plain></SENT>
