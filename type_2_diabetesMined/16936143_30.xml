<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate barriers to and strategies for medication adherence and predictors of adherence and the primary outcome in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Within a randomized, controlled primary prevention study for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we collected data on study medication adherence, its predictors, and health outcomes in 27 clinical centers across mainland U.S. and Hawaii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medication arm participants included 2,155 adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> randomly assigned to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or matched placebo treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structured interviews were used to promote medication adherence and to collect data regarding adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adherence was measured by pill count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary DPP outcome of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed by fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Older age-groups were more adherent than the youngest group (P = 0.01) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported barrier to adherence was "forgetting" (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women reported more adverse effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (15 vs. 10%, P = 0.002) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Odds of nonadherence increased as participants reported more than one barrier (odds ratio 19.1, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Odds of adherence increased as participants reported multiple strategies to take medication (2.69, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a 38.2% risk reduction for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for those adherent to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared with those adherent to placebo (P &lt; 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DPP medication adherence results are unique in primary prevention for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease in a large multiethnic sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our finding that adherence was associated with risk reduction for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> supports the development of brief interventions in clinical settings where medication adherence is a challenge </plain></SENT>
