<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed the association between the Gly482Ser variant of PPARGC1 and the arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> frequently found in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a group of 479 men and 253 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 70% of the men and in 73% of the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were examined by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the covariables associated with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an association between Ser allele homozygosis and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic men (odds ratio of 2.52 vs Gly allele homozygosis; 95% CI: 1.32-5.00; p=0.0064), but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic men was 77% vs 73% vs 67% for Ser-Ser, Gly-Ser and Gly-Gly carriers respectively (p=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, BMI, the use of insulin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were also independently associated with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have observed a sex-specific association between the PPARGC-1 gene Gly482Ser polymorphism and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate the genetic, biochemical and pathophysiological basis of this allelic association </plain></SENT>
