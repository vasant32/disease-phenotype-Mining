<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intermittent very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and glycemic control more than moderate caloric restriction alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 54) who were &gt; or = 20% over ideal body weight participated in a 20-week behavioral weight control program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized to either a standard behavioral therapy (SBT) group or to one of two VLCD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SBT subjects received a 1,500-1,800 kcal/day diet throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both VLCD groups followed a VLCD for 5 consecutive days during week 2, followed by either intermittent VLCD therapy for 1 day/week for 15 weeks (1-day) or for 5 consecutive days every 5 weeks (5-day), with a 1,500-1,800 kcal/day diet at other times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both VLCD groups lost more weight than the SBT group over the 20 weeks (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the groups did not differ in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) changes at 20 weeks, more subjects in the 5-day group attained a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HbA1c when compared with the SBT group (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This benefit was independent of the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best predictor of overall change in FPG and HbA1c was the FPG response during the first 3 weeks of the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Periodic VLCDs improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A regimen with intermittent 5-day VLCD therapy seemed particularly promising, because more subjects in this group attained a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response to a 3-week period of diet therapy predicted glycemic response at 20 weeks, and it was a better predictor of the 20-week response than initial or overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
