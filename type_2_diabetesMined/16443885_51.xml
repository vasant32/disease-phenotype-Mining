<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized double-blind trial enrolled 145 subjects at 18 centers in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Older adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy received add-on therapy with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, a thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizer, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and week 24 using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) in both groups was similar, and after 24 weeks both treatment groups showed similar significant reductions in FPG (2.1-2.3 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Working memory improved with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improvement (25-31% reduction in errors) was most evident on the Paired Associates Learning Test and was significantly correlated (r = 0.30) with improved glycemic control as measured by FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Similar and statistically significant cognitive improvement was observed with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> therapy, and the magnitude of this effect was correlated with the degree to which FPG improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a cognitive benefit is achievable with pharmacological interventions targeting glycemic control </plain></SENT>
