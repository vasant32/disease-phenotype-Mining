<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic investigation based on fine-mapped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) highlighting the genetic architecture and their role in modulating adiponectin plasma concentrations in a particularly healthy population of 1,727 Caucasians avoiding secondary effects from disease processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping 53 SNPs (average spacing of 0.7 kb) in the APM1 gene region in 81 Caucasians revealed a two-block linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure and enabled comprehensive tag SNP selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found particularly strong associations with adiponectin concentrations for 11 of the 15 tag SNPs in the 1,727 subjects (five P values &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis provided a thorough differentiation of adiponectin concentrations with 9 of 17 haplotypes showing significant associations (three P values &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found for any SNP with the parameters of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a two-block LD structure of APM1 pointing toward at least two independent association signals, one including the promoter SNPs and a second spanning the relevant exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data on a large number of healthy subjects suggest a clear modulation of adiponectin concentrations by variants of APM1, which are not merely a concomitant effect in the course of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
