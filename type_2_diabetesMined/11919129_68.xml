<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize potential differences in glycemic control, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level, and weight in a cohort of patients previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (TROG) who were switched to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After a 2-week washout from TROG, 186 patients were randomly assigned to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (PIO) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (ROSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weight, HbA(1c), and fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were documented before discontinuing TROG and at 4 months after starting either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondarily, the effect of concurrent medications on study outcomes was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 127 patients completed follow-up: 67 individuals in the PIO group (32 women, 35 men) and 60 individuals in the ROSI group (33 women, 27 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in gender mix, age, weight, fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, or HbA(1c) between the ROSI and PIO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 4 months of randomized treatment, no change in HbA(1c) from baseline between or within groups was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both groups experienced an equal and significant increase in weight from baseline of approximately 2.0 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thiazolidinedione and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy had significant and independent effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were noted in the PIO group (P &lt; 0.01), whereas none were detected with conversion to ROSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the PIO group experienced an average decrease in total cholesterol of approximately 20 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Differing effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were apparent after random conversion from TROG to either PIO or ROSI, despite similar weight increase and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of these differences remains to be determined, and further comparative research is warranted </plain></SENT>
