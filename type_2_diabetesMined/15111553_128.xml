<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which patients omit doses of medications prescribed for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A literature search (1966-2003) was performed to identify reports with quantitative data on adherence with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs) and insulin and correlations between adherence rates and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adequate documentation of adherence was found in 15 retrospective studies of OHA prescription refill rates, 5 prospective electronic monitoring OHA studies, and 3 retrospective insulin studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Retrospective analyses showed that adherence to OHA therapy ranged from 36 to 93% in patients remaining on treatment for 6-24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prospective electronic monitoring studies documented that patients took 67-85% of OHA doses as prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electronic monitoring identified poor compliers for interventions that improved adherence (61-79%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Young patients filled prescriptions for one-third of prescribed insulin doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin adherence among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 62-64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms that many patients for whom <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication was prescribed were poor compliers with treatment, including both OHAs and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, electronic monitoring systems were useful in improving adherence for individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar electronic monitoring systems for insulin administration could help healthcare providers determine patients needing additional support </plain></SENT>
