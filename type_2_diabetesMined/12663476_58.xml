<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated podocytes density, number, and structure in 67 white patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 21 normoalbuminuric (NA), 23 microalbuminuric (MA), and 23 proteinuric (P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kidney function and biopsy studies were performed; 20 kidney donors served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic morphometric analysis was used to estimate numerical density of podocytes per glomerulus [Nv(epi/glom)], filtration slit length density per glomerulus (FSLv/glom), and foot process width (FPW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of podocytes per glomerulus (Epi N/glom) was obtained by multiplying Nv(epi/glom) by mean glomerular volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nv(epi/glom) was significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic groups compared with control subjects and was lower in MA and P than in NA (P &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epi N/glom was lower in MA and P patients compared with control subjects (P &lt; 0.002, ANOVA); however, there were no significant differences among the type 2 diabetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, MA and P had decreased FSLv/glom and increased FPW compared with NA (P &lt; 0.005 for both, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The albumin excretion rate was inversely related to Nv(epi/glom) and FSLv/glom and directly to FPW (P &lt; 0.0005 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), whereas there was no correlation with Epi N/glom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, changes in podocyte structure and density occur since the early stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and might contribute to increasing <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings also suggest that in white type 2 diabetic patients, the density of podocytes may be functionally more relevant than the absolute number </plain></SENT>
