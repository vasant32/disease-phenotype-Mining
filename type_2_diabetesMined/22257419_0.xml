<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 3904 adults aged 45-70 (mean age 58.6 [standard deviation (SD) 6.9] years, mean body mass index (BMI) 29.9 [SD 4.7]kg/m(2)), with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and HbA1c as part of a large <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c for predicting impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), (defined either as FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/l, or 6.1-6.9 mmol/l), and T2DM (FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalences of IFG were 13.8% (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/l) and 4.5% (FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l) and of T2DM was 2.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/l as the IFG reference standard, HbA1c of 39-47 mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%) was 63% sensitive and 81% specific, and HbA1c 43-47 mmol/mol (6.1-6.4%) was 21% sensitive and 98% specific, in diagnosing IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) was 61% sensitive and 99% specific in diagnosing T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Having HbA1c 39-47 mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%), male sex, and body mass index &gt;29.5 together increased the odds of IFG 6.5-fold (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.5-7.8) compared to the pre-test odds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Defining 'pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>' at a lower HbA1c threshold of 39 mmol/mol (5.7%) instead of 47 mmol/mol (6.1%) increases its sensitivity in diagnosing IFG, but current American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association definitions of 'pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>' based on HbA1c would fail to detect almost 40% of people currently classified as IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This has implications for current and future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programmes, for vascular risk management, and for clinical advice given to people with 'pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>' based on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> data </plain></SENT>
