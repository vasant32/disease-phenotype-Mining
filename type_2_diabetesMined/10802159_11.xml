<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 110 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned into two groups, a multiple insulin injection therapy (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>) group or a conventional insulin injection therapy (CIT) group, and were followed-up for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Economic evaluation (cost-consequences analysis) was applied to evaluate both health and economic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As outcome measures for effectiveness of intensive insulin therapy, the frequency of complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, macrovascular event, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For estimating costs, a viewpoint of the payer (the National Health Insurance) was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct medical costs associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care during 10 years were calculated and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a base case analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> costs were discounted to the present value at an annual rate of 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the robustness of the results to changes in the values of important variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> reduced the relative risk in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> by 67%, photocoagulation by 77%, progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> by 66%, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> by 100% and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> by 64%, relative to CIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> prolonged the period in which patients were free of complications, including 2.0 years for progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001), 0.3 years for photocoagulation (P&lt;0.05), 1.5 years for progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.01) and 2.2 years for clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total cost (discounted at 3%) per patient during the 10-year period for each group was $30310 and 31525, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reduction of total costs in <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> over CIT was mainly due to reduced costs for management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results show that <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> is more beneficial than CIT in both cost and effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> is recommended for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients who require insulin therapy as early as possible from the perspective of both patients and health policy </plain></SENT>
