<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presenilin associated rhomboid like protein (PARL) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein that has been implicated in T2DM in both the rodent Psammomys obesus and in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SNP variant (Leu262Val) in PARL has been shown to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> in an age-dependent manner in a US non-diabetic, cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this finding has not been replicated in UK cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied Leu262Val associations in an Irish Caucasian T2DM case-control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An RFLP-PCR assay using BstN I was used to assess Leu262Val genotype in a total of 613 subjects, 421 with T2DM and 192 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group genotype frequencies were as follows 27.37% (GG), 51.58% (CG) and 21.05% (CC), while in the group with T2DM 30.64% (GG), 47.74% (CG) and 21.62% (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed no association between Leu262Val variant and T2DM nor was there an association with plasma insulin concentrations or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no interaction between age and fasting plasma insulin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the group with T2DM the C allele was associated with higher urinary albumin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio while the GG genotype was associated with an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Leu262Val polymorphism of PARL is not associated with markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in subjects with T2DM, genetic variation at this locus may indicate earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of T2DM and increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
