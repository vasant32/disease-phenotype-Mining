<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate glomerular charge selectivity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we studied changes in fractional clearance of proteins with different sizes and charges when patients were placed on two diets with different salt contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and normoalbuminuria (&lt; 20 micrograms/min, n = 8), <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (20-100 micrograms/min, n = 7), or advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (&gt; 100 micrograms/min, n = 4) were placed on a low-salt diet (85 mEq of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> daily) or a high-salt diet (255 mEq of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> daily) for 1 week, and then on the other diet, in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fractional clearances of albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were calculated on the last 3 days of each diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with normoalbuminuria, the high-salt diet increased the fractional clearance of IgG, which is electrically neutral, but the fractional clearance of albumin, which is anionic, was unaltered, suggesting that the pore charge of the glomerular barrier was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, the high-salt diet increased the fractional clearances of IgG and albumin equally, indicating some neutralization of the pore charge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fractional clearance of IgG in these first two groups was similar when salt intake was low, so pore size was the same in these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, fractional clearance of IgG was higher than in the other groups, indicating that size selectivity had worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients, charge selectivity is lost before size selectivity as diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> progresses </plain></SENT>
