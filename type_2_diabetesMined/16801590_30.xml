<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between stature-related measurements (height, leg length, and leg length-to-height ratio) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of 7,424 adults aged 40-74 years, from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were percent body fat, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> based on the World Health Organization's 1985 criteria for an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Shorter height and leg length, and lower leg length-to-height ratio, were associated with higher percent body fat, especially in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower leg length-to-height ratio was associated with greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> estimated by HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multinomial regression models adjusting for potential confounders, including percent body fat, the relative prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per 1-SD lower values in height, leg length, and leg length-to-height ratio were 1.10 (95% CI 0.94-0.29), 1.17 (0.98-1.39), and 1.19 (1.02-1.39), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the hypothesis that adult markers of prepubertal growth, especially leg length-to-height ratio, are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general U.S. population </plain></SENT>
