<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to replicate these findings in a Dutch cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed the genotypes of two intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TCF7L2 gene in 502 unrelated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and in a set of healthy controls (n = 920) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two SNPs showed almost complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We were able to replicate the previously reported association in our Breda cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The minor alleles of both variants were significantly over-represented in cases (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.09-1.52, [Formula: see text] for rs12255372; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19-1.66, [Formula: see text] for rs7903146) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, TCF7L2 haplotypes were analysed for association with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of haplotypes did not reveal any strong association beyond that expected from analysing individual SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TT haplotype carrying the minor alleles was more frequent among cases (OR 1.38, [Formula: see text]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data strongly confirm that variants of the TCF7L2 gene contribute to the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The population-attributable risk from this factor in the Dutch type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> population is 10% </plain></SENT>
