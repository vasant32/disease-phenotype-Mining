<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 146 patients randomly selected among those attending outpatient clinics at a University Hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information was collected regarding age, gender, known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, type of treatment and level of schooling, and a blood sample was taken to measure HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B-PAID was compared with the already validated Brazilian versions of Satisfaction with Life (SWL) and WHO Quality of Life-Brief (WHOQOL) Scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-hundred forty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients (48% males, 59.7+/-9 years, BMI: 29.7+/-5.2kg/m(2), mean duration: 8.63+/-8 years, HbA(1c): 7.2+/-1.7%) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between B-PAID and SWL (r(p)=0.55, p&lt;0.001) and WHOQOL (r(p)=-0.33, p&lt;0.05) Scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multiple regression analysis the B-PAID Scale was associated with younger age (p=0.006) and lower education level (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, B-PAID is a reliable, valid outcome measure for Brazilian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients and identifies patients at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> who should be prioritized in psychosocial intervention </plain></SENT>
