<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Age and sex matched 28 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 31 patients with IGT, and 31 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 DM were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SI and AIR were assessed by the reduced sample number of Bergman's minimal model method with intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in subjects of each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with NC group, serum hs-CRP was significantly increased in IGT and type 2 DM groups (p &lt; 0.001), although there was no significant difference between the latter groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hs-CRP was negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), SI and adiponectin levels (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.001), and positively correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), postprandial 2h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2hPG), fasting serum insulin (FINS) and postprandial serum insulin (PSI) in IGT and newly diagnosed type 2 DM groups (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general multivariate regression, only adiponectin was the significantly independent determinant for serum hs-CRP (regression coefficient -1.380; 95% CI -2.062 to 0.698, p &lt; 0.001); meanwhile, TG, SI, hs-CRP, FINS, 2hPG and WHR were significantly independent determinants for serum adiponectin concentration (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum hs-CRP may play a role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This elevation is accompanied by the opposite changes of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
