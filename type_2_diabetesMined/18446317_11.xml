<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female adolescents (age 12-18 years) with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (n = 8) and type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (n = 12) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 10) and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 10) non-diabetic controls were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline data included maximal aerobic capacity (cycle ergometer) and body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output and a-vO(2) were determined at rest and during submaximal exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic groups had lower aerobic capacity than non-diabetic groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adolescents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had lower aerobic capacity than the type 1 diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal heart rate was lower in the type 2 diabetic group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exercise <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume was 30-40% lower at 100 and 120 beats per min in the diabetic than in the non-diabetic groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The a-vO(2) value was not different in any condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATION: Type 2 diabetic adolescents have reduced aerobic capacity and <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> response to maximal exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, type 2 and type 1 diabetic adolescent girls have a blunted exercise <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume response compared with non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Central rather than peripheral mechanisms contribute to the reduced aerobic capacity in diabetic adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although of short duration, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adolescence is already affecting cardiovascular function in adolescents </plain></SENT>
