<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the relation between dietary fatty acids and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a prospective cohort study of 35,988 older women who initially did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline, and 1,890 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred during 11 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, demographic factors, and dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and cereal fiber, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence was negatively associated with dietary <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, vegetable fat, and trans fatty acids and positively associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi>, cholesterol, and the Keys score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After simultaneous adjustment for other dietary fat, only vegetable fat remained clearly related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative risks across quintiles of vegetable fat intake were 1.00, 0.90, 0.87, 0.84, and 0.82 (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> risk was also inversely related to substituting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> and positively correlated to the Keys dietary score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support an inverse relation between incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and vegetable fat and substituting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> and cholesterol </plain></SENT>
