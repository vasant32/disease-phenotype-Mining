<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term impact of a 7-h type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> continuing medical education (CME) program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included a measure of health care providers' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Attitude Scale (DAS), a validated measure of attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A CME program on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was presented by an expert panel in Chicago during November 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A before-after trial with pre- and postintervention measurements of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge and attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was administered as part of the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A convenience sample of the 129 health care providers in attendance resulted in 91 (71%) completed pre- and postintervention surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within-subjects analysis revealed increases in knowledge and more favorable attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between-subjects analysis revealed that attitude changes differed for physicians as compared with allied health care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A CME program was associated with an increase in knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and more favorable attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as measured by the DAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DAS changes were subtly different for the physician group as compared with the allied health care provider group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the DAS can be a useful instrument for measuring the short-term impact of educational interventions </plain></SENT>
