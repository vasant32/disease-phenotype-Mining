<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective cohort of 38,570 women who were aged â‰¥ 45 years, free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline, and free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline and in the first 12 months were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We classified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women into three groups according to the presence and absence of self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> or COPD (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004469'>chronic bronchitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002110'>bronchiectasis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12.2 years, 2472 incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> events were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women who had ever reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> or COPD were associated with an increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk; the multivariate RRs were 1.37 (95% CI, 1.20-1.57) for women who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> alone and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.14-1.67) for COPD without asthmatic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these associations were not significantly modified by age, smoking status, physical activity, BMI, alcohol intake, hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status or randomized treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>Asthma</z:hpo> and COPD were individually and independently associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> airway <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
