<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to identify doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> that would lower fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 12-week, double-blind, multicentre study, 380 patients with FPG values &gt; or =7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and &lt; or =13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) were randomly assigned to receive treatment with placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, 0.05, 0.25, 1.0, or 2.0 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
