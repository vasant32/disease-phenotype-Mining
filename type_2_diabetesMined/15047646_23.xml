<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime health and economic effects of optimal prevention and treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> according to international standards and to determine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A risk-based Markov model was developed to simulate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> disease in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> managed with care according to guidelines for their lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean survival time, quality of life, foot complications, and costs were the outcome measures assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current care was the reference comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from Dutch studies on the epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> disease, health care use, and costs, complemented with information from international studies, were used to feed the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with current care, guideline-based care resulted in improved life expectancy, gain of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and reduced incidence of foot complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lifetime costs of management of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> following guideline-based care resulted in a cost per QALY gained of &lt; 25,000 US dollars, even for levels of preventive foot care as low as 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness varied sharply, depending on the level of foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> reduction attained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Management of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> according to guideline-based care improves survival, reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> complications, and is cost-effective and even cost saving compared with standard care </plain></SENT>
