<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a three-arm randomized trial in 418 nondiabetic subjects aged 55-80 years recruited in one center (PREDIMED-Reus, northeastern Spain) of the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea [PREDIMED] study, a large nutrition intervention trial for primary cardiovascular prevention in individuals at high cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to education on a low-fat diet (control group) or to one of two MedDiets, supplemented with either free virgin olive oil (1 liter/week) or nuts (30 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diets were ad libitum, and no advice on physical activity was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence diagnosed by the 2009 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4.0 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence was 10.1% (95% CI 5.1-15.1), 11.0% (5.9-16.1), and 17.9% (11.4-24.4) in the MedDiet with olive oil group, the MedDiet with nuts group, and the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 0.49 (0.25-0.97) and 0.48 (0.24-0.96) in the MedDiet supplemented with olive oil and nuts groups, respectively, compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the two MedDiet groups were pooled and compared with the control group, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence was reduced by 52% (27-86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study arms, increased adherence to the MedDiet was inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> risk reduction occurred in the absence of significant changes in body weight or physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MedDiets without calorie restriction seem to be effective in the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects at high cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
