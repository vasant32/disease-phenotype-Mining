<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles from a large sample of African-American patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who receive care at an urban outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles of 4,014 African-Americans and 328 Caucasians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were retrieved from a computerized registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria were applied to classify <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) levels into risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients who had none, one, two, and three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> concentrations outside of recommended clinical targets was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistical regression analyses were performed to determine the influence of sex and race on the probability of having a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level outside of the recommended target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of African-Americans with high-, borderline-, and low-risk <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations were 58, 26, and 16%, respectively, and the percentages for Caucasians were 54, 29, and 16%, respectively (P = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, 41, 33, and 26% of African-Americans were in the high-, borderline-, and low-risk categories, respectively, compared with 73, 18, and 9% of Caucasians, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly 81% of African-Americans had TG concentrations that were in the low-risk category compared with only 50% of Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More women than men had high-risk <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> was an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level above target combined with an <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level below target, which was detected in nearly 50% of African-Americans and 42% of Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>African-Americans had lower odds of having an <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> or TG level outside of target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>African-American women, compared to men, had greater probabilities of having abnormal levels of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, but a lower likelihood of having a TG level above goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large sample of urban type 2 diabetic patients receiving care at a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment program, race and sex differences in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> was rare among African-American subjects, interventions will need to focus primarily on improving their <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required regarding how to best adapt these observed differences into more effective strategies to optimize <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels for this population of diabetic patients and to determine whether similar patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> occur in other clinical settings </plain></SENT>
