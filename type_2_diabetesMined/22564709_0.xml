<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study, participants (mean baseline HbA(1c) 8.53%) from Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines received lixisenatide (n = 154) or placebo (n = 157) in a stepwise dose increase to 20 µg once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was HbA(1c) change from baseline to week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Once-daily lixisenatide significantly improved HbA(1c) versus placebo (LS mean difference vs. placebo = -0.88% [95%CI= -1.116, -0.650]; p &lt; 0.0001), and allowed more patients to achieve HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% (35.6 vs. 5.2%) and ≤ 6.5% (17.8 vs. 1.3%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lixisenatide was well tolerated; 86% of patients on lixisenatide completed the study versus 92% on placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten (6.5%) lixisenatide and 9 (5.7%) placebo patients experienced serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More lixisenatide patients [14 (9.1%)] discontinued for adverse events versus placebo [5 (3.2%)], mainly with gastrointestinal causes </plain></SENT>
