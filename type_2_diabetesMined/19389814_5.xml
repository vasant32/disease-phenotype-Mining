<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare whether depressive symptoms are more strongly related to subsequent or prior glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to test whether patient characteristics modify these longitudinal associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: On two occasions separated by 6 months, depressive symptoms and glycemic control were assessed in 253 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses examined depressive symptoms as both a predictor and outcome of glycemic control and tested whether medication regimen (e.g., insulin versus oral drugs) was an effect modifier before and after adjusting for baseline levels of the outcome being predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Depressive symptom severity predicted poor glycemic control 6 months later (P = 0.018) but not after baseline glycemic control was taken into account (P = 0.361) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although baseline glycemic control did not generally predict depressive symptoms 6 months later (P = 0.558), it significantly interacted with regimen (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, glycemic control predicted depressive symptoms among patients prescribed insulin (beta = 0.31, P = 0.002) but not among those prescribed oral medication alone (beta = -0.10, P = 0.210) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Classifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> dichotomously produced similar but weaker findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms do not necessarily lead to worsened glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, insulin-treated patients in poor glycemic control are at moderate risk for worsening of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients should be carefully monitored to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment should be initiated or intensified </plain></SENT>
