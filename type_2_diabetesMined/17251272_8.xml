<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a genome-wide linkage scan for genes contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> risk using 794 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case subjects from 393 Mexican-American families from Starr County, Texas, having at least two diabetic siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sample included 567 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> case subjects comprising 282 affected sibling pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was classified as none, early nonproliferative, moderate-to-severe nonproliferative, or proliferative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using 360 polymorphic markers (average spacing 9.4 cM), we conducted nonparametric linkage analysis followed by ordered-subset analysis (OSA) ranking families by average age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, the highest LOD scores including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> families were on chromosomes 3 (2.41 at 117 cM) and 12 (2.47 at 15.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OSA logarithm of odds (LOD) scores &gt;2 for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> occurred on chromosomes 12 (4.47 at 13.2 cM), 15 (3.65 at 100.6), and 20 (2.67 at 54.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scores &gt;2 for either moderate-to-severe nonproliferative or proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> occurred on chromosomes 5 (2.53 at 11.2 cM), 6 (2.28 at 30.6), and 19 (2.21 at 100.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, unconditional linkage analysis revealed suggestive evidence of linkage with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> on two chromosomes, whereas OSA revealed strong evidence of linkage on two chromosomes, and suggestive evidence on four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Candidate genes were identified in most implicated regions </plain></SENT>
