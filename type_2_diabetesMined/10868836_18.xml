<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the following consecutive series of patients who attended a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> center for antibodies to GADA and IA-2A: 52 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients, 199 type 2 diabetic patients, 200 control patients, and a cohort of 34 nondiabetic identical twins of patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (15 of whom developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) who were followed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GADA or IA-2A were detected in 37 (71%) type 1 diabetic patients compared with only 10 (5%) type 2 diabetic patients (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both GAD and IA-2 antibodies, regardless of the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were usually subclass restricted to IgG1 and were polyclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgM, IgG3, and IgE isotypes were also detected, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isotypes of GADA and IA-2A were less prevalent than IgG1 (P&lt;0.017 for either antibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of spreading or switching of isotypes before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that the pathogenesis of antigen-specific antibodies in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is similar and probably involves a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nonrandom antigen-driven polyclonal B-cell activation that is consistent with a Th1-type immune response </plain></SENT>
