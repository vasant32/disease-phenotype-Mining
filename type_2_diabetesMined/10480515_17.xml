<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> care can be limited by clinical inertia-failure of the provider to intensify therapy when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although disease management programs have been proposed as a means to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, there are few studies examining their effectiveness in patient populations that have traditionally been underserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the impact of our management program in the Grady <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Unit, which provides care primarily to urban African-American patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed glycemic outcomes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had an intake evaluation between 1992 and 1996 and who were identified on the basis of compliance with keeping the recommended number of return visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 698 patients, we analyzed changes in HbA1c values between baseline and follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months, and the proportion of patients achieving a target value of &lt; or =7.0% at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since a greater emphasis on therapeutic intensification began in 1995, we also compared HbA1c values and clinical management in 1995-1996 with that of 1992-1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c averaged 9.3% on presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 12 months of care, HbA1c values averaged 8.2, 8.4, 8.5, 7.7, and 7.3% for the 1992-1996 cohorts, respectively, and were significantly lower compared with values on presentation (P &lt; 0.0025); the average fall in HbA1c was 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients achieving a target HbA1c &lt; or =7.0% improved progressively from 1993 to 1996, with 57% of the patients attaining this goal in 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c after 12 months was 7.6% in 1995-1996, significantly improved over the level of 8.4% in 1992-1994 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels after 12 months of care were lower in 1995-1996 versus 1992-1994, whether patients were managed with diet alone, oral agents, or insulin (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improved HbA1c in 1995-1996 versus 1992-1994 was associated with increased use of pharmacologic therapy CONCLUSIONS: Structured programs can improve glycemic control in urban African-Americans with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Self-examination of performance focused on overcoming clinical inertia is essential to progressive upgrading of care </plain></SENT>
