<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the LMNA gene (encoding lamin A/C) underlie familial partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo>, a syndrome of monogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LMNA maps to the well-replicated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-linkage region on chromosome 1q, and there are reported associations between LMNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (particularly rs4641; H566H) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between LMNA variation and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (using six tag SNPs capturing &gt;90% of common variation) in several large datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 2,490 U.K. diabetic case and 2,556 control subjects revealed no significant associations at either genotype or haplotype level: the minor allele at rs4641 was no more frequent in case subjects (allelic odds ratio [OR] 1.07 [95% CI 0.98-1.17], P = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 390 U.K. trios, family-based association analyses revealed nominally significant overtransmission of the major allele at rs12063564 (P = 0.01), which was not corroborated in other samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, genotypes for 2,817 additional subjects from the International 1q Consortium revealed no consistent case-control or family-based associations with LMNA variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our data, the OR for the rs4641 minor allele approached but did not attain significance (1.07 [0.99-1.15], P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data do not therefore support a major effect of LMNA variation on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in a meta-analysis including other available data, there is evidence that rs4641 has a modest effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility (1.10 [1.04-1.16], P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
