<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The German multicentre Retrolective Study 'Self-monitoring of Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and Outcome in Patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>' (ROSSO) followed 3,268 patients from diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 1995 and 1999 until the end of 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidity (non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> or haemodialysis) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SMBG was defined as self-measurement of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 6.5 years, 1,479 patients (45.3%) began SMBG prior to an endpoint and an additional 64 patients started SMBG after a non-fatal endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, many patients used SMBG while being treated with diet or oral hypoglycaemic drugs (808 of 2,515, 32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the SMBG cohort had higher mean fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels than the non-SMBG cohort (p&lt;0.001), suggesting that insufficient metabolic control was one reason for initiating SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a higher rate of microvascular endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the total rate of non-fatal events, micro- and macrovascular, was lower in the SMBG group than in the non-SMBG group (7.2 vs 10.4%, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar difference was found for the rate of fatal events (2.7 vs 4.6%, p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis identified SMBG as an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.68 (95% CI 0.51-0.91, p=0.009) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.31-0.78, p=0.003), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A better outcome for both endpoints was also observed in the SMBG cohort when only those patients who were not receiving insulin were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: SMBG was associated with decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and this association remained in a subgroup of patients who were not receiving insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SMBG may be associated with a healthier lifestyle and/or better disease management </plain></SENT>
