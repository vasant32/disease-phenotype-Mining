<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid formed by aggregation of human islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (hIAPP) is associated with beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used human and transgenic mouse islets in culture to examine whether deletion of caspase-3 protects islets from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by endogenously produced and exogenously applied hIAPP and compared hIAPP toxicity in islet alpha and beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or caspase-3 knockout mouse islet cells were treated with hIAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e> INS-1 cells were similarly cultured with hIAPP and the amyloid inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo Red</z:chebi> or caspase-3 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human and hIAPP-expressing caspase-3 knockout mouse islets were cultured to form amyloid fibrils and assessed for beta and alpha cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, beta cell function and caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: hIAPP-treated INS-1 cells had increased caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, both of which were reduced by inhibitors of amyloid or caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, hIAPP-treated human and mouse islet beta cells had elevated active caspase-3- and TUNEL-positive cells, whereas mouse islet cells lacking caspase-3 had markedly lower beta cell but comparable alpha cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During culture, human islets that formed amyloid had higher active caspase-3- and TUNEL-positive beta cells than those without detectable amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, cultured hIAPP-expressing mouse islets lacking caspase-3 had markedly lower beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than those expressing caspase-3, associated with an increase in islet beta cell/alpha cell ratio, insulin content and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Prevention of caspase-3 activation protects islet beta cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by fibrillogenesis of endogenously secreted and exogenously applied hIAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Islet beta cells are more susceptible to hIAPP toxicity than alpha cells cultured under the same conditions </plain></SENT>
