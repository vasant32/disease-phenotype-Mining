<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Respondents to the 2008 US Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (SHIELD) survey were asked the number of times they experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in the past 4 weeks and past 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Respondents also completed the short form-12 (SF-12) questionnaire and the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2DM respondents reporting at least 1 hypoglycemic episode were compared with T2DM respondents who did not report <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in the previous 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2718 T2DM respondents, 23% reported experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in the past 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respondents reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (n=627) had significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) SF-12 scores for both physical health (mean±SD: 37.4±12.7 versus 40.9±12.7) and mental health (50.1±11.7 versus 52.4±10.1) compared with those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (n=2091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean PHQ-9 scores were significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) among respondents reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (5.2±5.8), compared with respondents who did not report <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (3.9±5.0), indicating greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was prevalent among individuals with T2DM and associated with lower health-related quality of life, and greater burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
