<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated pulmonary function changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients receiving inhaled Technosphere Insulin (TI) or usual antidiabetes treatment (usual care) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This randomized, open-label study was conducted at 220 sites (25 July 2005 to 29 August 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function tests [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC) and lung diffusion capacity for <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (DL(CO))] were prospectively followed over 2 years in patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving TI (n = 730) or usual care (n = 824), along with a cohort without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not receiving any specific therapy (n = 145) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline demographics and pulmonary function were similar between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lung function declined from baseline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TI was non-inferior to usual care for mean change in FEV(1) from baseline to month 24 [mean (s.e.m.) 0.037 (0.0119) l; 95% CI 0.014 to 0.060] using mixed-model repeated-measure with a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 50 ml/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a greater initial decline at month 3 with TI, rate of change (slope) in FEV(1), FVC and DL(CO) (months 3-24) was not statistically different between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TI was well tolerated; no serious safety concerns emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common respiratory event associated with TI was mild, transient cough, occurring within minutes of inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Observed changes in lung function with TI were small, occurred early after therapy initiation, remained non-progressive over 2 years and were unlikely to be clinically meaningful </plain></SENT>
