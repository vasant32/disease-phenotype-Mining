<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through its effect on hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (HGP), glucagon plays a central role in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), abnormal regulation of glucagon secretion has been implicated in the development of fasting and postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, new therapeutic agents based on antagonizing glucagon action, and hence blockade of glucagon-induced HGP, could be effective in lowering both fasting and postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the mechanism of action, safety and efficacy of glucagon <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in the treatment of T2DM and discusses the challenges associated with this new potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment modality </plain></SENT>
