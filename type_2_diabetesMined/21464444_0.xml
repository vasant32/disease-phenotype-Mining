<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>/cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (cGKI) signaling pathway regulates cell functions that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of a dysfunction of this pathway for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in vivo is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression of cGKI in tissues relevant to insulin action was analyzed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metabolic consequences of a genetic deletion of cGKI were studied in mice that express cGKI selectively in smooth muscle but not in other cell types (cGKI-SM mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, cGKI protein was detected in hepatic stellate cells, but not in hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, fat cells, or pancreatic Î²-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control animals, cGKI-SM mice had higher energy expenditure in the light phase associated with lower body weight and fat mass and <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutant mice also showed higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, whereas insulin levels and intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test results were similar to those in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-6 signaling was strongly activated in the liver of cGKI-SM mice as demonstrated by increased levels of IL-6, phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Tyr 705), suppressor of cytokine signaling-3, and serum amyloid A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the liver was impaired in cGKI-SM mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fraction of Mac-2-positive macrophages in the liver was significantly higher in cGKI-SM mice than in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast with cGKI-SM mice, conditional knockout mice lacking cGKI only in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with respect to body weight, energy expenditure, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, IL-6, and insulin action in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic deletion of cGKI in non-neuronal cells results in a complex metabolic phenotype, including <z:mp ids='MP_0001860'>liver inflammation</z:mp> and fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Loss of cGKI in hepatic stellate cells may affect liver metabolism via a paracrine mechanism that involves enhanced macrophage infiltration and IL-6 signaling </plain></SENT>
