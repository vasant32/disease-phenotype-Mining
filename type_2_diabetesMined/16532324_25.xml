<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that these chemokines may be risk factors for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using a case-cohort design based on data from the population-based Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Disease</z:e> (MONICA)/Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg/Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA Augsburg) study, chemokine levels at baseline were analysed in 526 individuals with and 1,695 individuals without incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 10.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, largely independently of classic risk factors, whereas various clinical and metabolic parameters as well as lifestyle factors were major confounders of the association of IL-8 and IP-10 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 had no impact on the observed associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio (HR) for subjects with systemic concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three chemokines (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, IL-8 and IP-10) above the respective median compared with those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chemokines below or equal to the median was 1.79 (95% CI 1.18-2.72) and was comparable with the HR for elevated CRP and IL-6 together (adjusted for age, sex, survey, BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking and parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Elevated concentrations of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, IL-8 and IP-10 are associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas the association of IL-8 and IP-10 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was attenuated by multivariable adjustment, high <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels contributed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk independently of previously described clinical, metabolic and immunological risk factors </plain></SENT>
