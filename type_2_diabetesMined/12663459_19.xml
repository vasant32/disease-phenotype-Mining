<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In many organisms, normoglycemia is achieved by a tight coupling of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cell (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response [AIR]) and the metabolic action of insulin to stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (insulin action [M]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely accepted that in healthy individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, normoglycemia can always be maintained by compensatorily increasing AIR in response to decreasing M (and vice versa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has been mathematically described by the hyperbolic relationship between AIR and M and referred to as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration assumed to remain constant along the hyperbola </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is one of the signals stimulating AIR in response to decreasing M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypothetically, as with any normally functioning feed-forward system, AIR should not fully compensate for worsening M, since this would remove the stimulus for the compensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence from cross-sectional, longitudinal, and prospective data from Pima Indians (n = 413) and Caucasians (n = 60) that fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations increase with decreasing M despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> compensation of AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this physiologic adaptation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>), we propose to use the term "<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> allostasis." Allostasis (stability through change) ensures the continued homeostatic response (stability through staying the same) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress at some cumulative costs to the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With increasing severity and over time, the allostatic load (increase in glycemia) may have pathological consequences, such as the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
