<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a variance components linkage analysis of renal function, measured as glomerular filtration rate (GFR), in 63 extended families with multiple members with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GFR was estimated from serum concentrations of cystatin C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> in 406 diabetic and 428 nondiabetic relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results for cystatin C were summarized because they are superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GFR aggregates in families with significant heritability (h(2)) in diabetic (h(2) = 0.45, P &lt; 1 x 10(-5)) and nondiabetic (h(2) = 0.36, P &lt; 1 x 10(-3)) relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic correlation (r(G) = 0.35) between the GFR of diabetic and nondiabetic relatives was less than one (P = 0.01), suggesting that genes controlling GFR variation in these groups are different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage results supported this interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diabetic relatives, linkage was strong on chromosome 2q (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 4.1) and suggestive on 10q (LOD = 3.1) and 18p (LOD = 2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic relatives, linkage was suggestive on 3q (LOD = 2.2) and 11p (LOD = 2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When diabetic and nondiabetic relatives were combined, strong evidence for linkage was found only on 7p (LOD = 4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, partially distinct sets of genes control GFR variation in relatives with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on chromosome 2q, possibly on 10q and 18p in the former, and on 7p in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of these genes overlaps with genes controlling variation in urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
