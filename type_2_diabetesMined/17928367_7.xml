<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether dysregulation of arginine metabolism is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and underlies impaired nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) generation in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured plasma arginase activity, arginine metabolites, and skeletal muscle NO synthase (NOS) activity in 12 type 2 diabetic and 10 age-/BMI-matched nondiabetic subjects before and following a 4-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp with muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arginine metabolites were determined by tandem mass spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arginase activity was determined by conversion of [(14)C] guanidoinoarginine to [(14)C] <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> disposal (R(d)) was reduced by 50% in diabetic versus control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NOS activity was fourfold reduced in the diabetic group (107 +/- 45 vs. 459 +/- 100 pmol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1); P &lt; 0.05) and failed to increase with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma arginase activity was increased by 50% in the diabetic versus control group (0.48 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.12 micromol x ml(-1) x h(-1); P &lt; 0.05) and markedly declined in diabetic subjects with 4-h insulin infusion (to 0.13 +/- 0.04 micromol x ml(-1) x h(-1) vs. basal; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups collectively, plasma arginase activity correlated positively with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (R = 0.46, P &lt; 0.05) and A1C levels (R = 0.51, P &lt; 0.02) but not with R(d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma arginase activity is increased in type 2 diabetic subjects with impaired NOS activity, correlates with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and is reduced by physiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevated arginase activity may contribute to impaired NO generation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and insulin may ameliorate this defect via reducing arginase activity </plain></SENT>
