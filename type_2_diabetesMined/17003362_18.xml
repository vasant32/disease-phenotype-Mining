<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence indicate a causal role of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two common polymorphisms in the promoter of the IL-6 encoding gene IL6, -174G&gt;C (rs1800795) and -573G&gt;C (rs1800796), have been investigated for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in numerous studies but with results that have been largely equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between the two IL6 variants and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we analyzed individual data on &gt;20,000 participants from 21 published and unpublished studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collected data represent eight different countries, making this the largest association analysis for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GC and CC genotypes of IL6 -174G&gt;C were associated with a decreased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 0.91, P = 0.037), corresponding to a risk modification of nearly 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No evidence for association was found between IL6 -573G&gt;C and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed association of the IL6 -174 C-allele with a reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> provides further evidence for the hypothesis that immune mediators are causally related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, because the association is borderline significant, additional data are still needed to confirm this finding </plain></SENT>
