<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle is a hallmark of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to identify and validate genes involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: Differentially regulated genes in skeletal muscle of male <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant, and lean insulin-sensitive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were determined using Affymetrix microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, various aspects of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, insulin signalling and fatty acid composition were analysed in a muscle cell line overexpressing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">stearoyl-CoA</z:chebi> desaturase 1 (SCD1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene expression profiling in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle revealed the most pronounced changes in gene expression for genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these, Scd1 showed increased expression in insulin-resistant animals, correlating with increased amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53152">palmitoleoyl-CoA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was further investigated in a muscle cell line that overexpressed SCD1 and accumulated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, revealing impairments of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and of different steps of the insulin signalling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also observed differential effects of high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acid treatment on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and long-chain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37554">fatty acyl-CoA</z:chebi> profiles, and in particular an accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53152">palmitoleoyl-CoA</z:chebi> in cells overexpressing SCD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin-resistant skeletal muscle of ZDF rats is characterised by a specific gene expression profile with increased levels of Scd1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An insulin-resistant phenotype similar to that obtained by treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> can be induced in vitro by overexpression of SCD1 in muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This supports the hypothesis that elevated SCD1 expression is a possible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
