<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that IL-18 predicts future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a nested case-control design based in the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline blood samples were collected between 1989 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires to assess body weight, lifestyle (physical activity, diet, smoking) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis were sent out and assessed biennially (follow-up until 2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases (n = 1,012) were defined as women developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at least 1 year after blood sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control women (n = 1,081) were matched to cases by age, date of blood draw, fasting status and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We calculated the RR (95% CI) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in quintiles of IL-18 using conditional logistic regression with the first quintile as referent; adjustments included matching factors, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, BMI, adipokine levels (adiponectin, resistin) and inflammatory proteins (C-reactive protein, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor 2 (TNFalpha-R2) and IL-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher IL-18 levels were associated with increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even after adjustment for matching factors and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors: being in the highest quintile of IL-18 was associated with a RR of 1.75 (1.41-2.18) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relative to the first quintile (p &lt; 0.0001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant trends in association were still observed after adjustment for BMI (RR 1.44 [1.15-1.80], p &lt; 0.0001 for trend) and adiponectin levels (RR 1.28 [1.02-1.60], p = 0.006 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for inflammatory markers in a sub-sample did not significantly change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Elevated IL-18 levels are associated with higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This association is independent of usual risk factors, including BMI and adipokine levels </plain></SENT>
