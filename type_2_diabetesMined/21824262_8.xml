<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both intrinsic (within the α-cell itself) and paracrine (mediated by factors released β- and/or δ-cells) have been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glucagon secretion is maximally suppressed by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations that do not affect insulin and somatostatin secretion, a finding that highlights the significance of intrinsic regulation of glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments on islets from mice lacking functional ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels (K(ATP)-channels) indicate that these channels are critical to the α-cell's capacity to sense changes in extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we review recent data on the intrinsic and paracrine regulation of glucagon secretion in human pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced closure of the K(ATP)-channels, via membrane depolarization, culminates in reduced electrical activity and glucagon secretion by voltage-dependent inactivation of the ion channels involved in action potential firing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that glucagon secretion measured in islets isolated from donors with type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is reduced at low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulates rather than inhibits secretion in these islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We finally discuss the relative significance of paracrine and intrinsic regulation in the fed and fasted states and propose a unifying model for the regulation of glucagon secretion that incorporates both modes of control </plain></SENT>
