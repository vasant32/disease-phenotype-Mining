<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five rare mutations at the BLK locus, including only one non-synonymous p.A71T variant, were reported to segregate with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in three MODY families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p.A71T mutation was shown to abolish the enhancing effect of BLK on insulin content and secretion from pancreatic beta cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we reassessed the contribution of BLK to MODY and tested the effect of BLK-p.A71T on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and variations in related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BLK was sequenced in 64 unelucidated MODY samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BLK-p.A71T variant was genotyped in a French type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control study including 4,901 cases and 4,280 controls, and in the DESIR (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome) and SUVIMAX (Supplementation en <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33229">Vitamines</z:chebi> et <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46662">Mineraux</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22586">Antioxydants</z:chebi>) population-based cohorts (n = 6,905) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variant effects were assessed by logistic and linear regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No rare non-synonymous BLK mutations were found in the MODY patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BLK p.A71T mutation was present in 52 normoglycaemic individuals, making it very unlikely that this loss-of-function mutation causes highly penetrant MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found a nominal association between this variant and increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, with an enrichment of the mutation in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients, although no significant association with BMI was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: No mutation in BLK was found in our MODY cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From our findings, the BLK-p.A71T mutation may weakly influence type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>; however, this will require further validation </plain></SENT>
