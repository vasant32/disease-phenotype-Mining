<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effects of LR-90 in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and investigated the mechanisms by which it may protect against renal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male ZDF rats were treated without or with LR-90 from age 13 to 40 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic and kidney functions and renal histology were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AGE accumulation and the production of the receptor for AGE (AGER) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Profibrotic growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins and intracellular signalling pathways associated with glomerular and tubular damage were also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LR-90 dramatically reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in ZDF rats, with only modest effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Renal AGE, AGER and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> attenuated by LR-90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LR-90 significantly retarded the increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was associated with reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005576'>tubulointerstitial fibrosis</z:hpo>, concomitant with marked inhibition of renal overproduction of TGF-beta1, connective tissue growth factor, fibronectin and collagen IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, LR-90 downregulated the activation of key <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the renal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results support our earlier studies on the renoprotective effects of LR-90 on type 1 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and provide further evidence that LR-90, an AGE inhibitor with pleiotrophic effects, may also be beneficial for the prevention of type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, where multiple risk factors, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, contribute to renal injury </plain></SENT>
