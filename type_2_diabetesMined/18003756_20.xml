<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy charge whose sustained activation has recently been implicated in pancreatic beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and in islet cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> posttransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine the importance of beta-cell AMPK in cytokine-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and in the cytotoxic action of CD8(+) T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clonal MIN6 beta-cells or CD1 mouse pancreatic islets were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP/null), constitutively active AMPK (AMPK-CA), or dominant-negative AMPK (AMPK-DN) and exposed or not to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interferon-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected by monitoring the cleavage of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic effect of CD8(+) purified T-cells was examined against pancreatic islets from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e> mice infected with either null or the AMPK-DN-expressing adenoviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to cytokines, or expression of AMPK-CA, induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in clonal MIN6 beta-cells and CD1 mouse pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, overexpression of AMPK-DN protected against the proapoptotic effect of these agents, in part by preventing decreases in cellular ATP, and lowered the cytotoxic effect of CD8(+) T-cells toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e> mouse islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of AMPK activity enhances islet survival in the face of assault by either cytokines or T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AMPK may therefore represent an interesting therapeutic target to suppress immune-mediated beta-cell destruction and may increase the efficacy of islet allografts in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
