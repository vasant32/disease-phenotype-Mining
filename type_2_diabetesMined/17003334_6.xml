<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of STAT5 activity in beta-cells in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that expressed a dominant-negative mutant of STAT5a (DNSTAT5) or constitutive active mutant of STAT5b (CASTAT5) under control of the rat insulin 1 promoter (RIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When subjected to a high-fat diet, RIP-DNSTAT5 mice showed higher body weight, increased plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, whereas RIP-CASTAT5 mice were more <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant and less hyperleptinemic than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the pancreatic insulin content and relative beta-cell area were increased in high-fat diet-fed RIP-DNSTAT5 mice compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or RIP-CASTAT5 mice, RIP-DNSTAT5 mice showed reduced beta-cell proliferation at 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of high-fat diet or leptin on insulin secretion was diminished in isolated islets from RIP-DNSTAT5 mice compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon multiple low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> treatment, RIP-DNSTAT5 mice exhibited higher plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, lower plasma insulin levels, and lower pancreatic insulin content than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, whereas RIP-CASTAT5 mice maintained higher levels of plasma insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results indicate that STAT5 activity in beta-cells influences the susceptibility to experimentally induced type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
