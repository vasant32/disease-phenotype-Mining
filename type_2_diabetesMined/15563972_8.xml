<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were administered to 82 male diabetics and 25 male non-diabetics (controls), to determine the international index of erectile function (IIEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This index consists of five parts, with questions related to erectile function (EF), intercourse satisfaction (IS), orgasmic function (OF), sexual desire (SD), and overall satisfaction (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IIEF scores were compared between diabetics and controls, and were also analyzed in relation to clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although EF, IS, and OF scores (physical factors) in diabetic men were significantly lower than those of age-matched controls, no significant differences were apparent in SD and OS scores (psychological factors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with EF score &gt; or = 18 reported being able to achieve sexual intercourse, we determined the criterion for ED as EF &lt; 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of ED in diabetics and age-matched controls was 60% and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EF score decreased with duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, delayed nerve conduction, orthostatic intolerance, and attenuated heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ED was found to be common in Japanese male diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Possible influences of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> on ED are suggested </plain></SENT>
