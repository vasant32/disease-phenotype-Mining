<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 increases pulsatile insulin secretion in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted these studies with the hypothesis that GLP-1 would enhance pulsatile insulin secretion and alter <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments were conducted in nine patients (age: 72+/-5 years; BMI: 27+/-3kg/m(2); <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration: 7+/-3 years; HbA(1c): 6.6+/-0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent three <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first was a euglycemic clamp to determine individual insulin clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second, GLP-1 was infused from 0-240min (0.75pM/kg/min) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was maintained at fasting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third was similar except that octreotide (30ng/kg/min) was infused with GLP-1 to suppress pulsatile insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were given to match levels during the second study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3-(3)H-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was infused to allow calculation of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in measurements of pulsatile insulin secretion or hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates between the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because there was no difference in pulsatile insulin between experiments, we could not test the effect of pulsatile insulin on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine the impact of insulin pulses on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
