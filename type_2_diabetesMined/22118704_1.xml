<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use </plain></SENT>
