<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have examined the effects of exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness in Type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these studies had relatively small sample sizes and highly variable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore the aim of this study was to systematically review and quantify the effects of exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness in Type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and four other databases were searched up to March 2002 for randomized, controlled trials evaluating effects of structured aerobic exercise interventions of 8 weeks or more on cardiorespiratory fitness in adults with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiorespiratory fitness was defined as maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) during a maximal exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven studies, presenting data for nine randomized trials comparing exercise and control groups (overall n=266), met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean exercise characteristics were as follows: 3.4 sessions per week, 49 min per session for 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exercise intensity ranged from 50% to 75% of VO(2max) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was an 11.8% increase in VO(2max) in the exercise group and a 1.0% decrease in the control group (post intervention standardized mean difference =0.53, p&lt;0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Studies with higher exercise intensities tended to produce larger improvements in VO(2max) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exercise intensity predicted post-intervention weighted mean difference in HbA(1c) (r=-0.91, p=0.002) to a larger extent than did exercise volume (r=-0.46, p=0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Regular exercise has a statistically and clinically significant effect on VO(2max) in Type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Higher intensity exercise could have additional benefits on cardiorespiratory fitness and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
