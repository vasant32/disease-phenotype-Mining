<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were categorized into 4 subgroups, oral-agents, insulin therapy for &lt;or=1 month, 1-12 months, and &gt;12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum syndecan-1 was detected by ELISA, and potential correlation between syndecan-1 levels and clinical characteristics was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two diabetic patients and 20 healthy subjects (controls) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Syndecan-1 in diabetic patients (24.616+/-1.993 ng/ml) was higher than that of the controls (18.907+/-2.638 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average concentration of syndecan-1 in the group of oral-agents, insulin therapy for &lt;or=1 month, 1-12 months, and &gt;12 months was 19.157+/-2.556 ng/ml (n=20), 24.447+/-3.173 ng/ml (n=23), 35.005+/-4.749 ng/ml (n=11), and 27.593+/-8.304 ng/ml (n=8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association between serum syndecan-1 and intake of exogenous insulin was found (r=0.266, p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum syndecan-1 of insulin-therapy group (27.811+/-2.669 ng/ml) enhanced significantly compared to that of the controls (p=0.030) and that of the oral-agents group (p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Syndecan-1 of the insulin therapy for 1-12 months group enhanced predominantly compared to that of the controls (p=0.005) and the oral-agents group (p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and exogenous insulin usage increases serum syndecan-1 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exogenous insulin can promote shedding of syndecan-1 ectodomains to the serum in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
