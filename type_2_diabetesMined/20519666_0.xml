<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine a metabolic phenotype in three different groups of offspring to see distinct paternal versus <z:mp ids='MP_0003718'>maternal effects</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined body composition and insulin action (M) in nondiabetic subjects and insulin secretion tested via <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant full-heritage Pima Indian adults categorized by disparate parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status: 1) offspring of fathers with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age &lt;35 years) and nondiabetic mothers (ODF; n = 10), 2) offspring of mothers with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age &lt;35 years), not exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in utero with nondiabetic fathers (OMED; n = 11), and 3) a control group of offspring of parents without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> until &gt;50 years of age (CON; n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ODFs were leaner than CONs and OMEDs (percent of body fat [%BF]: least-squares means adjusted for age and sex [95% CI]: 27.3 [23.3-31.3] in ODFs vs. 35.4 [32.2-38.5] in CONs and 32.4 [28.8-36.1] in OMEDs, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ODFs were more insulin sensitive (had a higher M) than OMEDs or CONs, but not after adjustment for age, sex, and %BF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AIR adjusted for M, age, sex, and %BF was lower in ODFs versus CONs and OMEDs (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adult ODFs were leaner and had lower early insulin secretion, despite being equally insulin sensitive after adjustment for body fat compared to the other groups, indicating a paternal imprinted effect </plain></SENT>
