<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The 1985 manuscript describing the HOMA model, by Matthews and colleagues, is the most cited paper in the history of Diabetologia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this edition of 'Then and now' we assess the impact of this seminal paper by considering the contribution of this elegant work in the context of the most rapidly changing period in the history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HOMA was born in the middle of an 'era' of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and was subsequently nurtured and grew during the 'eras' of insulin sensitisers and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the modern era of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> onward, researchers have sought a convenient method for measuring insulin sensitivity and secretion, and found this in HOMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the explosion in the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clearly underlines that an understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and how it can be measured has been insufficient to make any impact on the growing pandemic of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of individual <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> is important, but the dramatic impact of the modern environment may be the factor that has escaped attention until very recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An optimist can only state that the coming 'era' in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> research will be a period of true translation of scientific insight and implementation of effective disease prevention </plain></SENT>
