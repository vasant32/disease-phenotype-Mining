<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the current study are to evaluate the role of FGF21 in energy metabolism and to provide mechanistic insights into its <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering effects in a high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (DIO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: DIO or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lean mice were treated with vehicle or recombinant murine FGF21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic parameters including body weight, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were monitored, and hepatic gene expression was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity were assessed using indirect calorimetry and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FGF21 dose dependently <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> and whole-body fat mass in DIO mice due to marked increases in total energy expenditure and physical activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FGF21 also reduced blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and reversed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The profound reduction of hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels was associated with FGF21 inhibition of nuclear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element binding protein-1 and the expression of a wide array of genes involved in fatty acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FGF21 also dramatically improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in both lean and DIO mice independently of reduction in body weight and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FGF21 corrects multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> in DIO mice and has the potential to become a powerful therapeutic to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
