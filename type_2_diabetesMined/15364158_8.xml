<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients were treated with b.i.d. preprandial injections of BIAsp 30 during a 2-week run-in period and subsequently randomized to a 4-week treatment with either pre- or postprandial b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BIAsp 30, followed by crossover to the other regimen for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values during a 4-h mealtest at the end of each treatment were similar for pre- and postprandial BIAsp 30 (153 +/- 58 mg/dl and 161 +/- 59 mg/dl, respectively, difference not significant) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six percent of patients reported a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycemic episode</z:e>; postprandial injection did not increase the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> as compared to preprandial injection (113 episodes versus 125 episodes, respectively) </plain></SENT>
