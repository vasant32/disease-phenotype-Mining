<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The functional mass of beta-cells is decreased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Replacing missing beta-cells or triggering their regeneration may thus allow for improved treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, to the extent that this is combined with therapy for improved insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although progress has been made in deriving beta-cell-like cells from stem or precursor cells in vitro, these cannot yet be obtained in sufficient quantities or well enough differentiated to envisage their therapeutic use in beta-cell replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Likewise, our very limited understanding of beta-cell regeneration in adult man does not yet allow for development of a valid strategy for kick-starting such a process in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whether by bona fide neogenesis or self-replication of existing beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regardless of how beta-cell mass is restored in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, it will be important to prevent any renewed decrease thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current understanding suggests that islet <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as well as signals from (insulin-resistant/inflamed) adipose tissue and skeletal muscle contribute towards decreased beta-cell mass in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It will likely be important to protect newly formed or implanted beta-cells from these negative influences to ensure their long-term survival </plain></SENT>
