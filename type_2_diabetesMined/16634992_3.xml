<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The tryptophan to arginine change in position 64 (Trp64Arg) polymorphism of the beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3AR) gene has been associated with an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this, decreased rates of energy expenditure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> could play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 10 male twin pairs discordant for the Trp64Arg polymorphism, we examined insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), a frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGT), body composition by the bioimpedance method, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning and energy expenditure by indirect and direct calorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twins heterozygous for the Trp64Arg polymorphism showed significantly lower fat mass independent of the method used, and significantly lower fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations compared with their homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> co-twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin secretion determined by homeostasis model assessment were significantly lower in twins carrying the Trp64Arg polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences in adiponectin levels, insulinogenic index assessed by OGTT, or insulin sensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness or insulin disposition index assessed by minimal modelling of the FSIGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were no differences in sleeping, resting or post-prandial energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In male twins with a high similarity in genetic and environmental background, the Trp64Arg polymorphism of the beta3AR gene is associated with lower fat mass, fasting insulin levels and an appropriate insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, heterozygosity for the Trp64Arg variant is unlikely to increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
