<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low carbohydrate diet on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, especially on visceral fat accumulation, and comparing that of a high carbohydrate diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to take a low calorie and low carbohydrate diet (n = 11, 1000 kcal per day, protein:carbohydrate:fat = 25:40:35) or a low calorie and high carbohydrate diet (n = 11, 1000 kcal per day, protein:carbohydrate:fat = 25:65:10) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar decreases in body weight and serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were observed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum insulin levels were reduced in the low carbohydrate diet group compared to the high carbohydrate diet group (-30% versus -10%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total serum cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels decreased in both groups, but were not significantly different from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) increased in the low carbohydrate diet group but not in the high carbohydrate diet group (+15% versus 0%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a larger decrease in visceral fat area measured by computed tomography in the low carbohydrate diet group compared to the high carbohydrate diet group (-40 cm(2) versus -10 cm(2), P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratio of visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area did not change in the high carbohydrate diet group (from 0.70 to 0.68), but it decreased significantly in the low carbohydrate diet group (from 0.69 to 0.47, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, when restrict diet was made isocaloric, a low calorie/low carbohydrate diet might be more effective treatment for a reduction of visceral fat, improved insulin sensitivity and increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels than low calorie/high carbohydrate diet in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
