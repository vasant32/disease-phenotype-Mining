<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Undercarboxylation of some <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi>-dependent proteins, due to genetic polymorphisms of VKORC1, can lead to calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined a potential association between VKORC1 -1639 G&gt;A polymorphism and T2DM and, also, the association of this polymorphism with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: VKORC1 -1639 G&gt;A polymorphism was determined in 299 T2DM patients and 328 controls of Caucasian origin using PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cIMT was measured in a subgroup of 118 T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of VKORC1 genotypes between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects differed significantly (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VKORC1 genotype was associated with T2DM in an adjusted model (OR 1.36, p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference was observed in the maximum value of cIMT among different genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VKORC1 -1639 G&gt;A polymorphism was an independent predictor of cIMT (p=0.029) after adjusting for established risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between VKORC1 -1639 G&gt;A polymorphism and risk of T2DM could be due to the higher prevalence of calcification in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the independent association between VKORC1 -1639 G&gt;A polymorphism and maximum cIMT in T2DM patients which is likely due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> characterized by increased calcification </plain></SENT>
