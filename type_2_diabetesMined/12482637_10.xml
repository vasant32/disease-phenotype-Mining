<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic studies were undertaken with the determination of dose-response curve for MAP and renal cortical blood flow (RCF) in response to U46619, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin-II</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> and endothelin-1, as well as the systemic hemodynamic response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and L-NG <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-arginine methylester (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male rats exhibited a paradoxical hypotensive response to U46619 (-18+/-11 mmHg) compared with a peak pressor response of +6+/-1 mmHg in female rats (P&lt;0.01, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the male diabetic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats exhibited an impaired response to vasoconstrictors (U46619 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin-II</z:chebi>) and to endothelial (NO)-mediated vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The male gender may therefore be associated with the greater prothrombotic activity and a worse impairment of endothelial reactivity in the type-2 diabetic state </plain></SENT>
