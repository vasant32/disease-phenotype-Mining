<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood monocytes were collected from 23 healthy controls, 18 latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA), and 22 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD14, TLR2 and TLR4 expression were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effect of 1,25-dihydroxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> (1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D3) on monocyte response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) was evaluated in vitro by measuring phosphorylation level of NF-kappaB-p65 and associated cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monocytes showed significantly higher surface CD14 expression from LADA compared with that from T2DM and controls, and high expression of TLR4 from LADA and T2DM than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After incubation with LPS or LTA, decreased surface expressions of CD14 were observed on monocytes from T2DM and controls, in contrast to the increased on monocytes from LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activation of NF-kappaB and amounts of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production by stimulation with ligands significantly increased in LADA and T2DM, which was modulated by 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D3 to similar level, as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The modulation of 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D3 on monocytes makes us to consider more potency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> as therapy in LADA and T2DM </plain></SENT>
