<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 67 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics, data on randomly selected patients were extracted from electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The score was calculated using process and outcome indicators based on monitoring, targets, and treatment of A1C, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The score ranged from 0 to 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 5,181 patients were analyzed; 477 (9.2%) patients developed a CV event after a median follow-up of 28 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) of CV events was 62.4 in patients with a score of &lt;15, 41.0 in those with a score between 20 and 25 and 36.7 in those with a score of &gt;25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multilevel analysis, adjusted for clustering and case-mix, showed that the risk to develop a new CV event was 84% higher in patients with a score of &lt;15 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-2.62) and 17% higher in those with a score between 15 and 25 (IRR = 1.17; 95% CI 0.93-1.49) compared with those with a score of &gt;25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean quality score varied across centers from 16.5 ± 7.5 to 29.1 ± 6.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the score was tested as the dependent variable, it emerged that 18% of the variance in the score could be attributed to setting characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study documented a close relationship between quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A simple score can be used to monitor quality of care and compare the performance of different centers/physicians </plain></SENT>
