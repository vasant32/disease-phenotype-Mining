<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare two methodological approaches suitable for analysing susceptibility to complex traits: single- and multi-locus analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised a total of 647 subjects in one of three groups: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with or without DN, or no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were detected by PCR-based methodology (PCR only, PCR plus RFLP, or allele-specific PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes were inferred in silico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Set association (tested using SUMSTAT software) was used for multilocus analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After correction for multiple comparisons, only one SNP, in the gene encoding the receptor of advanced glycation end products, AGER 2184A/G (gene symbol formerly known as RAGE) showed a significant association with DN (p = 0.0006) in single-locus analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multi-locus analysis, six SNPs exhibited a significant association with DN: four SNPs on chromosome 6p (AGER 2184A/G, LTA 252A/G, EDN1 8002G/A and AGER -429T/C) and two SNPs on chromosome 7q (NOS3 774C/T and NOS3 E298D), omnibus p = 0.033 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis revealed significant differences between DN and control groups in haplotype frequencies on chromosome 6 (p = 0.0002); however, there were no significant difference in the frequencies of the NOS3 haplotypes on chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis identified SNPs AGER 2184A/G and NOS3 774C/T, together with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration and HbA1c, as significant predictors of DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Testing for interactions between SNPs on chromosomes 6 and 7 did not provide significant evidence for epistatic interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Using the set-association approach we identified significant associations of several SNPs on chromosomes 6 and 7 with DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The single- and multi-locus analyses represent complementary methods </plain></SENT>
