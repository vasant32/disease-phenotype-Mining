<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the benefits of initiating insulin at an earlier versus later treatment stage, and regimens with/without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (SU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pooled analysis of 11 prospective randomized clinical trials, including 2171 adults with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> initiating insulin glargine following a specific titration algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) reduction, per cent achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0%, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and hypoglycaemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis compared outcomes 24 weeks after basal insulin initiation in patients previously uncontrolled on 0/1 oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug (OAD) versus 2 OADs, and in patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET) or SU alone or in combination at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was also conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the pooled analysis, patients on 0/1 OAD and those on MET monotherapy at baseline had the largest 24-week reductions in HbA1c following the addition of insulin glargine (∼0.44 U/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of patients failing MET/SU monotherapy and MET + SU in combination, 68.1, 50.4 and 56.4% achieved HbA1c ≤ 7.0%, respectively (p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> was lowest when basal insulin was added to MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients on 0/1 OAD at baseline had significantly less symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> when basal insulin was added than those on 2 OADs (p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite higher insulin doses, those taking MET alone had less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than those taking SU or MET + SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results were confirmed in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adding insulin glargine to MET monotherapy early in treatment may provide efficacy/safety benefits over regimens including SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may reflect treatment earlier in the disease and supports the inclusion of insulin as a second step in the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association/European Association for the Study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> treatment algorithm </plain></SENT>
