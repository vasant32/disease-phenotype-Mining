<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous and present evidence ascribes an important role to overstimulation of beta-cells for the secretory abnormalities associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abnormality most clearly linked to overstimulation is the elevated ratio of circulating proinsulin to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence obtained in human pancreatic islets suggests that aberrations in insulin oscillations that occur in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could at least in part be linked to abnormalities in cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> oscillations induced by overstimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in a transplantation model, we have obtained evidence for long-lasting, perhaps irreversible, effects of overstimulation, implying that this is a causative factor for the well-recognized deterioration of insulin secretion with increasing duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms behind the effects of overstimulation are only partly clarified, but it is clear that <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> after overstimulation is only partly explained by decreased insulin stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cultured human pancreatic islets, overstimulation by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> leads to a rise in cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> levels, which persists after normalization of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Persistent elevation of cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> may trigger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, thus participating in long-term irreversible deterioration of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide sufficient rationale for clinical studies to test the beneficial effects of relative beta-cell rest in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
