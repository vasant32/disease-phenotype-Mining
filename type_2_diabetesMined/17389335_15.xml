<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We followed 116,316 women aged 30-55 years in 1976 through 2002 for incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline and through biennial follow-up, women were asked about their history and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other potential risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 2.87 million person-years of follow-up, 3,463 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, the incidence of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was fourfold higher in women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (relative risk [RR] 4.7 [95% CI 3.3-6.6]) and twofold higher among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.8 [1.7-2.0]) than for nondiabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multivariate RR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was increased sixfold (6.3 [4.0-9.8]) in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and twofold (2.3 [2.0-2.6]) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risks for large-artery infarction and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also significantly associated with the risk of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (3.8 [1.2-11.8]), but type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not (1.0 [0.7-1.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with substantially increased risks of total and most subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
