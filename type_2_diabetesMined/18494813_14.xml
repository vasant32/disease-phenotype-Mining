<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if therapeutic management programmes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that include self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) result in greater reductions in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) compared with programmes without SMBG in non-insulin requiring patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multicentre, randomized, parallel-group trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 610 patients were randomized to SMBG or non-SMBG groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups received the same oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> modified release (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>)-based regimen for 27 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end-point was the difference between groups in HbA1c at the end of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 610 patients were randomized: 311 to the SMBG group and 299 to the non-SMBG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1c decreased from 8.12 to 6.95% in the SMBG group and from 8.12 to 7.20% in the non-SMBG group; between-group difference was 0.25% (95% CI: 0.06, 1.03; p = 0.0097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptoms suggestive of mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was the most commonly reported adverse event, reported by 27 (8.7%) and 21 (7.0%) patients in the SMBG and non-SMBG groups, respectively; the incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was lower in the SMBG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the application of SMBG as an adjunct to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent therapy results in further reductions in HbA1c </plain></SENT>
