<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the association between insulin sensitivity and autonomic regulation or about the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> on cardiac sympathovagal balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate heart rate variability (HRV) during the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in nondiabetic offspring of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 35 nondiabetic offspring of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 19 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probands were chosen from a 10-year follow-up study of patients with well-characterized type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to their fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level (selected from both ends of the distribution) and from control subjects to form three groups: 1) a group including subjects who were offspring of type 2 diabetic patients with low C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (deficient insulin secretion group [IS group], n = 17), 2) a group including subjects who were offspring of type 2 diabetic patients with high C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (insulin-resistant group [IR group], n = 18), and 3) a control group without a history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in first-degree relatives (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HRV was assessed at baseline and at the steady state during the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (M value) were lower in the IR group than in the IS group and the control group (41+/-3 vs. 54+/-2 vs. 60+/-4 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, heart rate increased significantly during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the IR group, insulin infusion increased total power of HRV [from 7.70+/-0.15 to 8.05+/-0.15 ln(ms2), P &lt; 0.01] and the low frequency-to-high frequency ratio (from 0.62+/-0.14 to 1.14+/-0.18, P &lt; 0.01) and decreased power of the high frequency spectral component (from 5.73+/-0.17 to 5.43+/-0.16 ln(ms2), P &lt; 0.05), whereas in other groups, changes in HRV were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the HRV response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in the offspring of type 2 diabetic probands was likely to be modulated by the type 2 diabetic phenotype of the parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In insulin-resistant subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> may be an earlier defect than hitherto acknowledged </plain></SENT>
