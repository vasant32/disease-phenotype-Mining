<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the associations of five variants of APM1 gene (C-11365G, A-4034C, A-3964G, T45G, and G276T) with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e>) in a larger cohort of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 879 diabetic men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 239 participants developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during 14 years of follow-up and 640 CVD-negative subjects were used as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was significantly lower in TT homozygotes at locus +276 than in other genotypes under a recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> model after adjusting for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, aspirin use, HbA1c, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (odds ratio 0.38 [95% CI 0.18-0.79]; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>-negative control subjects, the allele 276T was associated with significantly higher plasma adiponectin levels in a dose-dependent pattern (GG 14.8, GT 16.2, and TT 18.8 microg/ml) after adjusting for age, BMI, and other variables (P for trend = 0.0019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study showed significant associations between APM1 G276T and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk and increased plasma adiponectin levels in diabetic men </plain></SENT>
