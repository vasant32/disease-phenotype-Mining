<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The GOCADAN Study enrolled 1,214 participants &gt;or=18 years who were members of extended pedigrees from the Norton Sound region of Alaska </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was based on reported use of insulin or hypoglycaemic medications and a medication inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements were obtained to ascertain IFG status and undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OGTTs were performed to ascertain <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression analysis to model factors that were significantly associated with odds of prevalent <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalences of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG were 3.8% (5.0% of women; 2.2% of men) and 15.6% (13.9% of women; 17.7% of men), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subset of 787 participants who took the OGTT, the prevalences of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and WHO <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 5.1 and 6.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.8 times higher in participants meeting Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> than in those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The statistically significant sex-related difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence did not persist in multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Alaska Eskimos have a low prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of IFG indicates that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may become increasingly problematic in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in women may help explain why <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence differs according to sex </plain></SENT>
