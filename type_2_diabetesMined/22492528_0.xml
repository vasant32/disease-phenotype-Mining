<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to test whether pancreatic β-cells contribute to BA-dependent regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed with islets from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO), and β-cell ATP-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channel gene SUR1 (ABCC8) KO mice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9407">taurochenodeoxycholate</z:chebi> (TCDC) increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect was mimicked by the FXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> GW4064 and suppressed by the FXR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> guggulsterone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCDC and GW4064 stimulated the electrical activity of β-cells and enhanced cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were blunted by guggulsterone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> ursodeoxycholate, which has a much lower affinity to FXR than TCDC, had no effect on [Ca(2+)](c) and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FXR activation by TCDC is suggested to inhibit K(ATP) current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decline in K(ATP) channel activity by TCDC was only observed in β-cells with intact metabolism and was reversed by guggulsterone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCDC did not alter insulin secretion in islets of SUR1-KO or FXR-KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TCDC did not change islet cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the first study showing an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> action of BA on β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect is mediated by FXR by nongenomic elements, suggesting a novel link between FXR activation and K(ATP) channel inhibition </plain></SENT>
