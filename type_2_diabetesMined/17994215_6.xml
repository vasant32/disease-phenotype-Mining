<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the LMNA gene in 3,093 case-control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between LMNA SNPs and quantitative metabolic traits was also examined in the 1,674 normoglycaemic adults who made up the control cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SNP rs505058, a synonymous SNP (D446D) in exon 7, showed nominal evidence of association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [p = 0.003, odds ratio (OR) 1.30 (95% CI 1.09-1.56)] in French Europids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of available rs505058 genotype data from 7,819 participants provided support for a modest association of rs505058 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [p = 0.003, OR 1.19 (95% CI 1.06-1.35)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence (p = 0.91) that the tag SNP rs4641 is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available rs4641 genotype data in a total of 15,591 participants produced borderline evidence of association [p = 0.054, OR 1.05 (95% CI 1.00-1.11)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNP rs6669212, in the 3' untranslated region of LMNA, exhibited suggestive associations with WHR (p = 0.013), fasting serum levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.023) and triacylglycerol (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We emphasise that these quantitative trait associations are not corrected for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The available data do not support a major effect of common LMNA variation on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in northern Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further large-scale studies are required to conclusively establish the extent to which LMNA variants have an impact on quantitative metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
