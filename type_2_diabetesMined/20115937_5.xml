<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 2218 men and women (mean age 28 years) were studied from a population-based birth cohort born in a large town and adjacent rural villages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> [DM] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT], and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin secretion (calculated) were examined in relation to BMI and height at birth, and in infancy, childhood and adolescence and changes in BMI and height between these stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two (2.8%) subjects had Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM) and 362 (16.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IGT and DM combined (IGT/DM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were associated with low childhood body mass index (BMI) (p&lt;0.001 for both) and above-average BMI gain between childhood or adolescence and adult life (p&lt;0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no direct associations between birthweight or infant size and IGT/DM; however, after adjusting for adult BMI, lower birthweight was associated with an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of IGT and Type 2 DM is associated with thinness at birth and in childhood followed by accelerated BMI gain through adolescence </plain></SENT>
