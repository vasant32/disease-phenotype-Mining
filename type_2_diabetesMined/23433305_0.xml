<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the blood pressure-lowering effects of the GLP-1 RAs exenatide and liraglutide compared with other common drugs used to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including data describing complete blood pressure (BP) changes from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the major databases for published or unpublished RCTs that had been performed in patients with T2DM and compared the effects of exenatide and liraglutide to those of other common drugs used to treat T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RCTs that included data describing BP changes between the baseline and the end of the study were selected for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs that enrolled 3443 patients in the GLP-1 RA treatment group and 2417 subjects in the control group were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GLP-1 RA exenatide <z:mp ids='MP_0006264'>reduced systolic blood pressure</z:mp> (SBP) when compared with both placebo and insulin glargine, with mean differences of -5.24 and -3.46 mmHg, respectively, and with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of -6.88 to -3.59, p &lt; 0.00001 and -3.63 to -3.29, p &lt; 0.00001, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, in the exenatide-treated group, diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) was reduced by -5.91 mmHg, with a 95% CI of -7.53 to -4.28, p &lt; 0.00001 compared with the placebo group, and -0.99 mmHg with a 95% CI of -1.12 to -0.87, p &lt; 0.00001 compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SBP changes in this meta-analysis were assessed in the groups treated with 1.2 or 1.8 mg liraglutide per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 1.2 mg-treated group, liraglutide treatment reduced SBP compared with placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment, with mean differences of -5.60 and -2.38 mmHg, and 95% CIs of -5.84 to -5.36, p &lt; 0.00001 and -4.75 to -0.01, p = 0.05, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 1.8-mg-treated group, liraglutide also reduced SBP compared with placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment with mean differences of -4.49 and -2.62 mmHg, and a 95% CI of -4.73 to -4.26, p &lt; 0.00001, and -2.91 to -2.33, p &lt; 0.00001, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with the GLP-1 RAs exenatide and liraglutide reduced SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> by 1 to 5 mmHg compared with some other anti-diabetic drugs including insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and placebo for patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 RAs may offer an alternative therapy for these patients and will help provide extra cardiovascular benefits </plain></SENT>
