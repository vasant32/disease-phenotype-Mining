<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, particularly visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, is a major risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonly used <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> indicators, BMI, waist girth, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), have limited ability to measure the visceral adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) has been shown to predict the amount of visceral fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far no study has been published on its ability to predict <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed and compared the prediction of the four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> indicators for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in a prospective study based on 5,168 participants from the nationally representative Health 2000 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up lasting 8.1 years, 222 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models adjusted for lifestyle factors, BMI, waist girth, WHR, and SAD were significant predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative risks (95% CI) between high and low levels were 15.0 (6.94-32.6), 11.4 (5.39-23.8), 12.5 (6.47-24.2), and 14.7 (6.89-31.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pairwise interaction analysis showed that the co-occurrence of high BMI and high SAD was associated with the highest <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, with a relative risk of 37.0 (11.2-122) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for waist girth and the components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, the relative risk was 9.88 (2.81-34.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The corresponding population-attributable fraction estimate was 84% (49-95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of SAD and BMI measurements yields a new predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
