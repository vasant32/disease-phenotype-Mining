<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the safety and efficacy of the potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin 5 mg when given for 24 weeks to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were either treatment-naive or who had received one oral antidiabetes drug (OAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicentre, randomized, parallel group, phase III study compared linagliptin treatment (5 mg once daily, n = 336) with placebo (n = 167) for 24 weeks in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before randomization, patients pretreated with one OAD underwent a washout period of 6 weeks, which included a placebo run-in period during the last 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients previously untreated with an OAD underwent a 2-week placebo run-in period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linagliptin treatment resulted in a placebo-corrected change in HbA1c from baseline of -0.69% (p &lt; 0.0001) at 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 9.0%, the adjusted reduction in HbA1c was 1.01% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with linagliptin were more likely to achieve a reduction in HbA1c of ≥0.5% at 24 weeks than those in the placebo arm (47.1 and 19.0%, respectively; odds ratio, OR = 4.2, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> improved by -1.3 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.0001) with linagliptin vs. placebo, and linagliptin produced an adjusted mean reduction from baseline after 24 weeks in 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of -3.2 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant and relevant treatment differences were observed for proinsulin/insulin ratio (p = 0.025), Homeostasis Model Assessment-%B (p = 0.049) and disposition index (p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no excess of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> with linagliptin vs. placebo and no patient required third-party intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mild or moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> did not influence the trough plasma levels of linagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with linagliptin produced a significant, clinically meaningful and sustained improvement in glycaemic control, accompanied by enhanced parameters of β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The safety profile of linagliptin was comparable with that of placebo </plain></SENT>
