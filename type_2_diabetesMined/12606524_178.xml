<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined prospectively the effects of the central inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We designed a nested case-control study within the prospective population-based European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study including 27,548 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case subjects were defined to be those who were free of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline and subsequently developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a 2.3-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 192 cases of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified and matched with 384 non-disease-developing control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were found to be elevated in participants with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas IL-1beta plasma levels did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of single cytokines revealed IL-6 as an independent predictor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), sports, smoking status, educational attainment, alcohol consumption, and HbA(1c) (4th vs. the 1st quartile: odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between TNF-alpha and future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was no longer significant after adjustment for BMI or WHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, combined analysis of the cytokines revealed a significant interaction between IL-1beta and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the fully adjusted model, participants with detectable levels of IL-1beta and elevated levels of IL-6 had an independently increased risk to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (3.3, 1.7-6.8), whereas individuals with increased concentrations of IL-6 but undetectable levels of IL-1beta had no significantly increased risk, both compared with the low-level reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed in an analysis including only individuals with HbA(1c) &lt;5.8% at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the pattern of circulating inflammatory cytokines modifies the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In particular, a combined elevation of IL-1beta and IL-6, rather than the isolated elevation of IL-6 alone, independently increases the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data strongly support the hypothesis that a subclinical inflammatory reaction has a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
