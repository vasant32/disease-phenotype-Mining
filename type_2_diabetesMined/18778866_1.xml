<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a support to determine properties such as anti-atherogenic or atherogenic effects, recent clinical studies suppose to determine the ratio of each APN multimer to total APN but not the absolute plasma concentration of APN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the correlation of APN and its multimers with myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme with pro-inflammatory properties, was examined in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MPO and APN serum levels were assessed in 49 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> at the beginning and at the end of an anti-diabetic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treatment a significant increase in the ratio of HMW to total APN (from 0.43+/-0.16 to 0.59+/-0.14, p&lt;0.05) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, HMW-APN was correlated positively with MPO (r=0.314, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between the increased HMW ratio and MPO during treatment (r=0.304, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HMW-APN correlates positively with MPO in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, HMW-APN may exert possible pro-inflammatory effects in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
