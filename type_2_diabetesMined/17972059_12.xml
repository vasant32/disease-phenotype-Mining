<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020474,C1704417" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Familial combined hyperlipidaemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e>) is characterised by hypertriacylglycerolaemia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, disturbances in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism are commonly seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesised that TCF7L2 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility for this common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the effect of the TCF7L2 variants, rs7903146 and rs12255372, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e> and its component traits triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (ApoB) in 759 individuals from 55 Mexican families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a replication sample, 719 individuals from 60 Finnish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e> families were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also used quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the transcript levels of TCF7L2 in 47 subcutaneous fat biopsies from unrelated Mexican <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e> and normolipidaemic participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant evidence for association was observed for high TG for the T alleles of rs7903146 and rs12255372 (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01) in Mexican <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No evidence for association was observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e>, TC, ApoB or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in Mexicans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When testing rs7903146 and rs12255372 for replication in Finnish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e> families, these single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with TG (p = 0.01 and p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed statistically significant decreases in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (p = 0.0002) of TCF7L2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e>- and TG-affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TCF7L2 expression was not altered by the SNP genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data show that rs7903146 and rs12255372 are significantly associated with high TG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e> families from two different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, significantly decreased expression of TCF7L2 was observed in TG- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e>-affected individuals </plain></SENT>
