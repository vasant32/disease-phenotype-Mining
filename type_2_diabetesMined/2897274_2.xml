<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the possibility that this epidemiologic difference was indicative of a basic metabolic phenomenon, estimates of insulin secretion and insulin action were generated in 32 Chinese males, 16 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 16 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Half of the individuals in each diagnostic category were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (body mass index greater than 28 kg/m2) and half were non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (less than 26 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responses to a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge were significantly higher in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but did not vary significantly within either group as a function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma insulin concentrations were lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> when patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were compared to their weight-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the absolute insulin values also varied as a function of body weight, with higher plasma insulin concentrations observed in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin action was estimated by determination of the steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SSPG) concentrations during the last 60 min of a continuous 180-min intravenous infusion of somatostatin, crystalline insulin, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions endogenous insulin secretion is suppressed, SSPI concentrations are similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals, and SSPG concentrations provide a quantitative estimate of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of these studies indicated that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly elevated SSPG concentrations as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, and this was true whether the diabetic subjects were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
