<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined whether intakes of whole grains and dietary fiber were associated with inflammatory indicators among 902 diabetic women in the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, BMI, lifestyle, and dietary covariates, intakes of whole grains and bran were both associated with significantly decreasing trends of C-reactive protein (CRP) (P for trend = 0.03 and 0.007, respectively) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha receptor 2 (TNF-R2) (P for trend = 0.017 and 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High intake of cereal fiber was also inversely associated with the lower levels of CRP (P for trend = 0.03) and TNF-R2 (P for trend = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of CRP and TNF-R2 were 18 and 8% lower in the highest quintile of cereal fiber as compared with the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dietary glycemic index was positively associated with CRP (P for trend = 0.04) and TNF-R2 (P for trend = 0.0008) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of CRP and TNF-R2 were 32 and 11% higher, respectively, in the highest quintile of dietary glycemic index as compared with the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that whole grains and a low-glycemic index diet may reduce systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
