<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pathophysiology involved in PAD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the hemodynamic response to exercise of patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The hemodynamic response in calf muscles of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, PAD, or both was determined using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients performed both a plantar-flexion and treadmill-walking exercise regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Skeletal muscle capillary blood volume expansion during exercise, as measured by NIRS, was significantly impaired in the lower extremities of diabetic patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ankle-brachial index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative deoxygenation and oxygenation recovery times measured by NIRS correlates significantly with the presence of PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have reduced capillary volume expansion even without PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is likely due to impaired vasodilation secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine whether pharmaceutical intervention improves the blood volume expansion in the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
