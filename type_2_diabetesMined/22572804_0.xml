<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The capacity of plasma and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> from 26 individuals with moderately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to support cholesterol efflux was compared with 26 age- and sex-matched individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also compared the rates of RCT in vivo in two animal models: db/db mice and mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic individuals had characteristic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and higher levels of plasma AGEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The capacity of whole plasma, ApoB-depleted plasma and isolated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> to support cholesterol efflux was greater for diabetic patients compared with controls despite their lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The capacity of plasma to support cholesterol efflux correlated with plasma levels of cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> transfer protein and levels of ApoB, but not with levels of AGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RCT was severely impaired in db/db mice despite <z:mp ids='MP_0001556'>elevated HDL-cholesterol levels</z:mp> and no change in AGE concentration, whereas RCT in uraemic mice was unaffected despite elevated AGE levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: AGEs are unlikely to contribute significantly to the impairment of RCT in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
