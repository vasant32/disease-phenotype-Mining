<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is growing rapidly, not only in developed countries but also worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We chose to study type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in West Africa, where <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is less common than in the U.S., reasoning that in an environment where calories are less abundant, incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might carry a proportionately greater genetic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through the Africa America <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> (AADM) study, we carried out a genome-wide linkage analysis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a cohort of 343 affected sibling pairs (691 individuals) enrolled from five West African centers in two countries (Ghana: Accra and Kumasi; Nigeria: Enugu, Ibadan, and Lagos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 390 polymorphic markers were genotyped, and multipoint linkage analysis was conducted using the GENEHUNTER-PLUS and ASM programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suggestive evidence of linkage was observed in four regions on three chromosomes (12, 19, and 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two largest logarithm of odds scores of 2.63 and 1.92 for chromosomes 20q13.3 and 12q24, respectively, are particularly interesting because these regions have been reported to harbor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes in several other populations and ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the history of forced migration of West African populations during the slave trade, these results should have considerable relevance to the study of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African Americans </plain></SENT>
