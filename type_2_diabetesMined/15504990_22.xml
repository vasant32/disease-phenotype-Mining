<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In a previous study, we found observational evidence of improvement in beta-cell function when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was added to a failing oral antihyperglycemic regimen consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm our previous observations, we designed and performed a prospective, randomized, and controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 17 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, inadequately controlled on a maximized oral antihyperglycemic double regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, were randomized to the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or insulin to their treatment regimens for a period of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline and at 6 months, the following were performed: measurement of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting proinsulin, and insulin levels; frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test; and glucagon stimulation test for C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine subjects were randomized to the addition of 8 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, and eight subjects were randomized to the addition of one injection of insulin (premixed 70/30) before their evening meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were well matched for age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most important, the HbA(1c) was well matched between groups before treatment (8.7 +/- 0.3 and 9.0 +/- 0.3%; NS) and at the end of the 6 months (7.8 +/- 0.5 and 7.8 +/- 0.3%; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, at the end of the study, there was a significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group (+15.3 microIU x ml(-1) x 10 min(-1); P &lt; 0.001) that led to an increase in the disposition index from 0.18 at baseline to 4.18 at 6 months (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, at the end of the study, the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio had decreased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group by 36% (P = 0.03) but did not change significantly in the insulin treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, but not insulin, induced a recovery of pancreatic beta-cell function, as evidenced by the restoration of the first-phase insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, improvement in the disposition index, and a decrease in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in whom oral antihyperglycemic therapy failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This improvement was independent of the correction of glucotoxicity </plain></SENT>
