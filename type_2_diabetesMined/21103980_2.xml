<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increased risk may be due in part to the increased levels of inflammatory factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi>-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2)) is a risk marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and has pro-inflammatory effects in atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to determine whether Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) levels partially explain the greater prevalence of subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and greater incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> outcomes associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Cardiovascular Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional and prospective study of 4,062 men and women without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> from the Cardiovascular Health Study (1989 to 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) mass and activity were measured in baseline plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subclinical disease was determined at baseline and incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was ascertained annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression for cross-sectional analyses and Cox proportional hazards models for incident analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) mass did not differ significantly by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status; however, Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity was significantly higher among type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline subclinical disease was significantly associated with baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and this association was similar in models unadjusted or adjusted for Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) (OR 1.68 [95% CI 1.31-2.15] vs OR 1.67 [95% CI 1.30-2.13]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also significantly associated with incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events, including fatal CHD, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and non-fatal MI in multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in these estimates after further adjustment for Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this older cohort, differences in Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity did not explain any of the excess risk for subclinical disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> outcomes related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
