<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to clarify the clinical and genetic characteristics of the diabetic patients who have antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADab) but are diagnosed initially as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five GADab+ patients and 137 GADab- patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GADab+ patients were divided into two subgroups according to their antibody titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high-titer subgroup (Ab &gt; or = 20 U/ml) had lower urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations, and was assigned insulin therapy more often than the GADab- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the high-titer subgroup, clinical parameters in the low-titer subgroup were similar to the GADab- diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels correlated negatively with the GADab titer in the GADab+ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-susceptible HLA alleles revealed high frequencies of the B54 and DRB1*0405 allele, but not the B61 and DRB1*0901 alleles, in the high-titer subgroup, whereas the frequency of the protective DRB1*1502 allele was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GADab+ patients with the B54 allele had higher GADab titers and lower urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> excretion than patients without this allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that patients with a high-GADab titer share the autoimmune background characteristic of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
