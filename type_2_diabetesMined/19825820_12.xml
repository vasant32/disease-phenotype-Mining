<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Dietary recommendations are focused mainly on relative dietary fat and carbohydrate content in relation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, high-protein diets may contribute to disturbance of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, but evidence from prospective studies is scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the association among dietary total, vegetable, and animal protein intake and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence and whether consuming 5 energy % from protein at the expense of 5 energy % from either carbohydrates or fat was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 38,094 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC)-NL study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary protein intake was measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was verified against medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 10 years of follow-up, 918 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> risk increased with higher total protein (hazard ratio 2.15 [95% CI 1.77-2.60] highest vs. lowest quartile) and animal protein (2.18 [1.80-2.63]) intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for confounders did not materially change these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> measures attenuated the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vegetable protein was not related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consuming 5 energy % from total or animal protein at the expense of 5 energy % from carbohydrates or fat increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diets high in animal protein are associated with an increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest a similar association for total protein itself instead of only animal sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Consumption of energy from protein at the expense of energy from either carbohydrates or fat may similarly increase <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that accounting for protein content in dietary recommendations for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention may be useful </plain></SENT>
