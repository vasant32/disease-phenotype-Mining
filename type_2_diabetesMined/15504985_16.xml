<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic contribution of PTPN1 to measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis has been assessed in 811 Hispanic subjects from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study Family Study (IRASFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 161 kb and containing the PTPN1 gene were genotyped and tested for association </plain></SENT>
