<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 176 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 40-75 years, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>General practitioners were encouraged to make decisions according to a standardized step-up regimen until the target level of glycemic control was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The random allocation to a strict or a less strict target level of glycemic control (fasting capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt; 6.5 or &lt; 8.5 mmol/l), change in HbA1c and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and initiating insulin or treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> were studied as putative determinants of scores on a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> symptom checklist, a profile of mood states, an affect balance scale, and general well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjustments were made for baseline scores on the outcome at issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive affect (an odds ratio [OR] [95% CI] of 0.39 [0.19-0.83]) and perceived treatment burden (OR 0.48 [0.23-0.98]) were unfavorably altered in the group randomly allocated to stricter target levels (fasting capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt; 6.5 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a decrease in HbA1c of 1% or more tended to have comparatively favorable mood (OR displeasure score 0.35 [0.13-0.94]) and general well-being scores at 1 year (ORs of having unfavorable scores ranged from 0.4 to 0.5, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perceived treatment burden and positive effect are unfavorably affected by random allocation to a strict target level for glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved glycemic control is associated with favorable mood and possibly general well-being in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
