<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Study on Lifestyle intervention and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>Impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> Maastricht, 147 men and women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) were randomized to either a combined diet-and-exercise intervention or a control program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after 1 year, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, an exercise test, and anthropometric measurements were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, complete data of 103 subjects (50 intervention and 53 control subjects) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lifestyle intervention reduced plasma leptin concentrations (-14.2%) in IGT subjects but did not alter plasma adiponectin (-0.3%) or resistin (-6.5%) concentrations despite marked improvements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in leptin concentration were related to improvements in insulin sensitivity independent of changes in body composition </plain></SENT>
