<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that complexity of self-care regimen rather than the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, is more important in determining this relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand thirty-four adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated with: diet and exercise, oral medications, oral medications and insulin, 1-2 daily injections of insulin, and &gt; or =3 daily injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants completed the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> inventory (BDI) and had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) performed as part of routine clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pearson correlations between BDI scores and HbA(1c) were low and insignificant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (0.015&lt; or =r&lt; or =0.066) except for those administering three or more daily shots of insulin (r=0.284; p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The results of this study clearly show that while depressive symptoms are significantly correlated to glycemic control in patients taking three or more insulin injections per day, there is no relationship in patients who are taking fewer than three injections per day </plain></SENT>
