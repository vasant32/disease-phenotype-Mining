<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of the regulatory protease dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) are currently under development in preclinical and clinical studies (several pharmaceutical companies, now in Phase III) as potential drugs for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their development is based on the observation that DPP-IV rapidly inactivates the incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1), which is released postprandially from the gut and increases insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV inhibitors stabilise endogenous GLP-1 at physiological concentrations, and induce insulin secretion in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent manner; therefore, they do not demonstrate any hypoglycaemic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they are orally bioavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to their ability to protect GLP-1 against degradation, DPP-IV inhibitors also stabilise other incretins, including gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also reduce the antagonistic and desensitising effects of the fragments formed by truncation of the incretins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In clinical studies, when used for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over a 1-year period, DPP-IV inhibitors show improved efficacy over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding can be explained by a GLP-1-induced increase in the number of beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Potential risks associated with DPP-IV inhibitors include the prolongation of the action of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormones</z:chebi>, neuropeptides and chemokines cleaved by the protease, and their interaction with DPP-IV-related proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on their mode of action, DPP-IV inhibitors seem to be of particular value in early forms of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, either alone or in combination with other types of oral agents </plain></SENT>
