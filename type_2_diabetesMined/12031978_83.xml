<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> may contribute to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine whether elevated hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase [AST], or gamma -glutamyltranspeptidase [GGT]) are associated with prospective changes in liver or whole-body insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and whether these elevated enzymes predict the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured ALT, AST, and GGT in 451 nondiabetic (75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test) Pima Indians (aged 30 +/- 6 years, body fat 33 +/- 8%, ALT 45 +/- 29 units/l, AST 34 +/- 18 units/l, and GGT 56 +/- 40 units/l [mean +/- SD]) who were characterized for body composition (hydrodensitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), whole-body insulin sensitivity (M), and hepatic insulin sensitivity (hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output [HGO] during the low-dose insulin infusion of a hyperinsulinemic clamp) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) (25-g intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three subjects developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over an average follow-up of 6.9 +/- 4.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 224 subjects, who remained nondiabetic, follow-up measurements of M and AIR were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline, ALT, AST, and GGT were related to percent body fat (r = 0.16, 0.17, and 0.11, respectively), M (r = -0.32, - 0.28, and -0.24), and HGO (r = 0.27, 0.12, and 0.14; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a proportional hazard analysis with adjustment for age, sex, body fat, M, and AIR, higher ALT [relative hazard 90th vs. 10th centiles (95% CI): 1.9 (1.1-3.3), P = 0.02], but not AST or GGT, predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated ALT at baseline was associated prospectively with an increase in HGO (r = 0.21, P = 0.001) but not with changes in M or AIR (both P = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher ALT concentrations were cross-sectionally associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and whole-body and hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and prospectively associated with a decline in hepatic insulin sensitivity and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that high ALT is a marker of risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and suggest a potential role of the liver in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
