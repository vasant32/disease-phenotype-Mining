<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired FPG level (â‰¥5.6 mmol/L) among nondiabetic subjects (501 men) was defined according to the established guidelines, and the group with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> included subjects (159 men) who were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, insulin therapy, and/or diet.RESULTSDuring the 19-year follow-up, a total of 190 SCDs occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative risk (RR) for SCD was 1.51-fold (95% CI 1.07-2.14, P = 0.020) for nondiabetic men with impaired FPG and 2.86-fold (1.87-4.38, P &lt; 0.001) for men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as compared with men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FPG levels, after adjustment for age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, smoking, prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD), and family history of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The respective RRs for out-of-hospital SCDs (157 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) were 1.79-fold (1.24-2.58, P = 0.001) for nondiabetic men with impaired FPG and 2.26-fold (1.34-3.77, P &lt; 0.001) for men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Impaired FPG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a continuous variable, a 1 mmol/L increment in FPG was related to an increase of 10% in the risk of SCD (1.10 [1.04-1.20], P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONSImpaired FPG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> represent risk factors for SCD </plain></SENT>
