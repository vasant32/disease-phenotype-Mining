<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients in seven practices with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were selected if within a 6-month period they had two glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) levels of at least 8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient factors that may influence control were compared for patients grouped according to their last two HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Review of 643 medical records of diabetic patients treated by 29 clinicians identified 69 study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After at least 1 year of follow-up 26 patients became well controlled, 14 had intermediate control, and 29 remained in poor control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Becoming controlled was not significantly associated with gender, age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BMI, or HbA1c levels prior to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was inversely associated with greater use of medications (P = 0.04), and positively associated with understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.03), adherence to recommendations for meal plan (P = 0.001), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one percent of patients who became controlled had a change in life circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reasons for not advancing medications were probably justified for 69% of patients who remained uncontrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improved control depends largely on patient self-care behaviors </plain></SENT>
