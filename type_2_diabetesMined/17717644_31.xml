<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anthropometric measurements and self-reported sleep duration were determined in a cross-sectional sample of 323 men and 417 women aged 21-64 years from the Quebec Family Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis indicators were compared between short (5-6 h), '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' (7-8 h) and long (9-10 h) sleeper groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using adults with 7-8 h of sleep as a reference, the adjusted odds ratio for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/IGT was 1.58 (1.13-2.31) for those with 9-10 h of sleep and 2.09 (1.34-2.98) for those with 5-6 h of sleep, after adjustment for potential confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The short and long sleepers presented significantly higher total insulin AUC (p &lt; 0.05), whereas total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC was not different between the three sleeper groups in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area below fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations was significantly higher in short (p &lt; 0.01) and long sleepers (p &lt; 0.05) compared with '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' sleepers, and significantly higher in short (p &lt; 0.05) compared with long sleepers in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study provides evidence that short- and long-duration sleep times are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/IGT in adults, even after adjustment for several confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results also showed that the lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations at the end of the OGTT were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751509" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">short sleepers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the glucostatic theory of appetite control, this represents a stimulus that can trigger episodes of hunger and spontaneous food intake, which may explain at least in part the greater risk of overweight displayed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751509" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">short sleepers</z:e>, as shown in previous studies </plain></SENT>
