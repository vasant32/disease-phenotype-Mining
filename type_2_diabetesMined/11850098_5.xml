<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> insufficiently controlled with diet alone were randomised to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, 100 mg thrice daily, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, 1 mg thrice daily, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after 16 weeks of treatment, 24-h profiles of proinsulin, insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (fasting, 1 h after breakfast and every 3-h for a 24-h period) were measured under metabolic ward conditions with standardised meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, a reduced 24-h level of proinsulin was observed compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (AUC 1096 +/- 118 vs. 1604 +/- 174 pmol/l per h, P&lt;0.05) at 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The breakfast increment of proinsulin was lower with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (6.8 vs. 19.3 pmol/l, P&lt;0.05) as was the level at that time (37.3 +/- 5.3 vs. 56.4 +/- 7.5 pmol/l, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A lower AUC of insulin after treatment was also observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (7.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 14.8 +/- 4.5 nmol/l per h, P&lt;0.05), as also for 1-h increment (81 +/- 26, vs. 380 +/- 120 pmol/l, P&lt;0.01) and 1-h level (325 +/- 30 vs. 621 +/- 132 pmol/l, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> reduced 1-h breakfast <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increment (baseline 6.3 +/- 0.6, 16-week 3.5 +/- 0.6 mmol/l, P&lt;0.01) and 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level (18.1 +/- 1.1 and 14.5 +/- 1.3 mmol/l, P&lt;0.01), whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> did not (6.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.6 mmol/l and 18.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 15.3 +/- 1.3 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of circadian excursions of proinsulin and insulin reveals distinct differences in meal-time proinsulin and insulin increment and level between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> whereas fasting levels of these insulin fractions remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
