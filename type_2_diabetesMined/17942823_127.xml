<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Three independent studies have shown that variation in the fat mass and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated (FTO) gene associates with BMI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effect of FTO variation on metabolic traits including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and related quantitative phenotypes was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was genotyped in a total of 17,508 Danes from five different study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In studies of 3,856 type 2 diabetic case subjects and 4,861 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant control subjects, the minor A-allele of rs9939609 associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.13 [95% CI 1.06-1.20], P = 9 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association was abolished when adjusting for BMI (1.06 [0.97-1.16], P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 17,162 middle-aged Danes, the A-allele associated with overweight (1.19 [1.13-1.24], P = 1 x 10(-12)) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (1.27 [1.20-1.34], P = 2 x 10(-16)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related quantitative traits such as body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, and fasting serum leptin levels were significantly elevated in A-allele carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An interaction between the FTO rs9939609 genotype and physical activity (P = 0.007) was found, where physically inactive homozygous risk A-allele carriers had a 1.95 +/- 0.3 kg/m(2) increase in BMI compared with homozygous T-allele carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We validate that variation in FTO is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when not adjusted for BMI and with an overall increase in body fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, low physical activity seems to accentuate the effect of FTO rs9939609 on body fat accumulation </plain></SENT>
