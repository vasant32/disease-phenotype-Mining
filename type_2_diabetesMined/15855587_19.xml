<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an opportunistic screening strategy addressed to individuals with one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e>, based on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score (DRS) as the initial instrument, for the identification of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The DRS, a simple self-administered questionnaire, was completed by individuals identified by general practitioners and presenting with one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a 2-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optimal DRS cutoff was calculated by applying the receiver-operating characteristic curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 1,377 individuals aged between 55 and 75 years received an OGTT and completed the DRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean DRS values showed a marked variation according to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism categories, as follows: 8.7 +/- 3.0 in normoglycemic individuals, 9.5 +/- 3.1 in individuals with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 9.9 +/- 3.3 in individuals with IGT, and 12.0 +/- 3.5 in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The receiver-operating characteristic curve showed that, with a cutoff of 9, the sensitivity of DRS in detecting individuals with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormalities (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or IGT) was 77% and the specificity 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of the DRS as an initial screening instrument, followed by the measurement of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in individuals with a score &gt; or =9 and by the OGTT in individuals with a fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/l, would lead to the identification of 83% of the case subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 57% of the case subjects with IGT, at a cost of an OGTT in 38% of the sample and a fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DRS can represent a valid inexpensive instrument for opportunistic screening and a useful alternative to indiscriminate fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement, not readily available in general practice </plain></SENT>
