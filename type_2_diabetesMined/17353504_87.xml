<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the effects of continuous exenatide administration from a long-acting release (LAR) formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, exenatide LAR (0.8 or 2.0 mg) was administered subcutaneously once weekly for 15 weeks to subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 45) suboptimally controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (60%) and/or diet and exercise (40%): 40% female, A1C (mean +/- SD) 8.5 +/- 1.2%, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 9.9 +/- 2.3 mmol/l, weight 106 +/- 20 kg, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 5 +/- 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From baseline to week 15, exenatide LAR reduced mean +/- SE A1C by -1.4 +/- 0.3% (0.8 mg) and -1.7 +/- 0.3% (2.0 mg), compared with +0.4 +/- 0.3% with placebo LAR (P &lt; 0.0001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C of &lt; or =7% was achieved by 36 and 86% of subjects receiving 0.8 and 2.0 mg exenatide LAR, respectively, compared with 0% of subjects receiving placebo LAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reduced by -2.4 +/- 0.9 mmol/l (0.8 mg) and -2.2 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (2.0 mg) compared with +1.0 +/- 0.7 mmol/l with placebo LAR (P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exenatide LAR reduced self-monitored <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects receiving 2.0 mg exenatide LAR had body weight reductions (-3.8 +/- 1.4 kg) (P &lt; 0.05), whereas body weight was unchanged with both placebo LAR and the 0.8-mg dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> was the most frequent adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No subjects treated with exenatide LAR withdrew from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide LAR offers the potential of 24-h glycemic control and weight reduction with a novel once-weekly treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
