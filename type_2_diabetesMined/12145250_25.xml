<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of type and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with erectile function in men &gt;50 years of age in a large prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects included 31,027 men aged 53-90 years in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On a questionnaire mailed in 2000, participants rated their ability (without treatment) in the past 5 years to have and maintain an erection sufficient for intercourse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men who reported poor or very poor function were considered to have ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> information was ascertained via self-report and documented with supplementary medical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had an age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of 1.32 (95% CI 1.3-1.4) for having ED compared with men without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable regression analyses, men with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were at a significantly higher risk for ED (type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> RR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.5-5.9; type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> RR = 1.3, 1.1-1.5) than nondiabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had an increasingly greater risk of ED with increased duration since diagnosis (trend test P value &lt;0.0001) (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7, for men diagnosed &gt;20 years previously) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For men over age 50 years, increasing duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was positively associated with increased risk of ED relative to nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association persisted despite the higher prevalence of other comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ED prevention and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management efforts are likely to go hand-in-hand </plain></SENT>
