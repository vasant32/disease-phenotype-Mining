<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined insulin action on signal transduction and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport in isolated vastus lateralis skeletal muscle from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients (n = 8, 41 +/- 3 years, BMI 25.1 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2)) and healthy control subjects (n = 9, 40 +/- 2 years, BMI 23.4 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal and submaximal insulin-stimulated (0.6 and 1.2 nmol/l) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport was comparable between groups, whereas the maximal response (120 nmol/l) was 38% lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Insulin increased</z:e> phosphorylation of Akt and Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) in a dose-dependent manner, with comparable responses between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AS160 phosphorylation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport were positively correlated in control subjects (R(2) = 0.97, P = 0.01) but not relatives (R(2) = 0.46, P = 0.32) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>)-1alpha, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta, PPARdelta, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and uncoupling protein-3 was comparable between first-degree relatives and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the uncoupling of insulin action on Akt/AS160 signaling and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport implicates defective GLUT4 trafficking as an early event in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
