<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the DD genotype is a predictor of mortality and of the decline in renal function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and established <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 56 such patients of Maltese Caucasian descent were recruited, and their ACE genotype was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> was estimated approximately every 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated according to the Cockroft-Gault formula, and rate of change was determined by regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of change in calculated GFR was -7.76 ml.min(-1).year(-1) in those with the DD genotype (n = 31) and -1.17 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>h(-1) in those with the ID or II genotype (n = 25) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year mortality was 45.2% in the DD group compared with 20.0% in the ID/II group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DD genotype of the ACE gene polymorphism is associated with a more rapid decline in renal function and higher mortality in type 2 diabetic patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
