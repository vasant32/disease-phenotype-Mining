<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1993 and 1995, 72% of eligible members of a Native Canadian community participated in a baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting samples were collected for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, proinsulin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was administered, and a second sample for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was drawn after 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure and waist circumference were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) (n = 505) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) (n = 74) were included in cross-sectional analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1998, 95 individuals who had IGT or NGT at baseline with an elevated 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (&gt; or = 7.0 mmol/l) participated in a follow-up evaluation using the protocol used at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional and prospective associations between proinsulin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were assessed using correlation and multiple linear regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates including age, sex, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, waist circumference, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, fasting proinsulin concentration was significantly associated with concurrently measured <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> concentrations (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>: r = 0.18, P &lt; 0.0001; total cholesterol: r = 0.10, P = 0.02; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>: r = 0.11, P = 0.01; <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>: r = -0.16, P = 0.0002; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) B: r = 0.17, P &lt; 0.0001; apoAI: r = -0.11, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the adjusted prospective analysis, baseline <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and apoB were associated with changes over time in proinsulin (r = 0.23, P = 0.04; r = -0.30, P = 0.01; r = 0.23, P = 0.04; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previously reported cross-sectional associations between proinsulin and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, an unexpected association between baseline <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and proinsulin change was documented </plain></SENT>
