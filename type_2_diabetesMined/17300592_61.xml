<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 24-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing the effects of vildagliptin (50 or 100 mg daily) with placebo as an add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg daily) in 463 patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by prior TZD monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between-treatment comparisons of efficacy parameters were made by analysis of covariance model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted mean change (AM Delta) in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) from baseline to endpoint was -0.8 +/- 0.1% (p = 0.001 vs. placebo) and -1.0 +/- 0.1% (p &lt; 0.001 vs. placebo), respectively, in patients receiving vildagliptin 50 or 100 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to baseline, vildagliptin added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> also reduced fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) (AM Delta FPG =-0.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/l and -1.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l; not significant (NS) vs. placebo) and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) [AM Delta <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> =-1.9 +/- 0.6 mmol/l and -2.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/l (p = 0.008 vs. placebo)] for 50 and 100 mg daily respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to placebo, both doses of vildagliptin significantly increased the insulin secretory rate/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by more than threefold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 55.5, 50.0 and 48.7% in patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg daily or placebo respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serious AEs were experienced by 6.8, 1.3 and 5.7% of patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg daily or placebo respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reported by 0, 0.6 and 1.9% of patients, respectively, receiving vildagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg daily or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vildagliptin is effective and well tolerated when added to a maximum dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, without increasing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
