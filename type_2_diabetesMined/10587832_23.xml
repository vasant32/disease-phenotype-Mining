<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the association between age, BMI, and subsequent incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Australian aboriginal people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a stratified analysis of incidence data from a community-based longitudinal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measures included fasting and 2-h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, and BMI, stratified into four categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 882 male and female participants in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening initiatives in two remote Australian aboriginal communities, free from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, ages 15-77 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 46 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 2,808 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI modified strongly the sex- and community-adjusted association between age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for age, sex, and community, the population <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence rate was 20.3 cases/1,000 person-years, with BMI-specific rates of 10.7-47.2 cases/1,000 person-years, and relative risks (95% CI) for BMI strata beyond the reference category (&lt; 25 kg/m2) of 3.3 (1.5-7.0), 2.7 (1.1-6.8), and 4.4 (1.7-11.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The population's attributable risk (95% CI) associated with BMI beyond the reference category was 70.1% (58.1-82.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMI-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence rates in Australian aboriginal people are among the highest in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> incidence in the lowest BMI category (10.7 cases/1,000 person-years) is two to five times greater than corresponding rates for non-aboriginal populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An urgent need exists to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to determine for aboriginal people an optimal range of BMI, likely lower than that suggested for non-aboriginal populations </plain></SENT>
