<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: In the recently published The Justification for the Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">Rosuvastatin</z:chebi> (JUPITER) mega-trial, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> significantly reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of a small but significant increase in the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was in keeping with a recent meta-analysis which suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, with the possible exception of pravastatin, marginally increase the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Although the net effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> was obviously very positive, we hypothesized that the addition of a bile aid sequestrant to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> would not only further decrease <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and potentially further decrease cardiovascular events but also protect against the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is particularly relevant because the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrant, colesevelam, has recently been approved for therapy of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Colesevelam like other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants lowers <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels by 16% and C-reactive protein by 22% beyond the reductions that occur with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants confer <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering, and anti-inflammatory benefits, and have been shown to reduce risk of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, colesevelam should be the most effective and logical agent to add to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> in the diabetic and insulin-resistant patient, because in addition to lowering cardiac risk it may prevent the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as well as improving glycaemic control in the established diabetic patient </plain></SENT>
