<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of different doses of ipragliflozin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 12-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study patients with inadequate glycaemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (≥1500 mg/day) were randomized to one of four ipragliflozin treatment groups (12.5, 50, 150 or 300 mg once daily) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy outcome was mean change from baseline in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) compared to placebo at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs), vital signs and laboratory safety measurements were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ipragliflozin dose dependently decreased HbA1c from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo (-0.22, -0.34, -0.40 and -0.48% for ipragliflozin 12.5, 50, 150 and 300 mg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreases in body weight and blood pressure were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ipragliflozin groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AEs occurred in 39.7-51.4% of the ipragliflozin groups and 39.4% of placebo patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>Urinary tract infections</z:hpo> (1.4-6.9 vs. 6.1%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> (0-4.3 vs. 1.5%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (0-5.9 vs. 3.0%) were similar in the ipragliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, without dose dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no clinically relevant effects on other safety measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ipragliflozin treatment improved glycaemic control when added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy and may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and reductions in blood pressure compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No safety or tolerability concerns were identified at any of the tested doses supporting the further development of ipragliflozin at ≥50 mg doses in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
