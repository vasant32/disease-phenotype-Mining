<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested the hypothesis that Txnip-null (knockout) mice are protected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> induced by a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Txnip gene-deleted (knockout) mice and age-matched <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermate control mice were maintained on a standard chow diet or subjected to 4 weeks of high-fat feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were assessed for body composition, fat development, energy balance, and insulin responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adipogenesis was measured from ex vivo fat preparations, and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes after forced manipulation of Txnip expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Txnip knockout mice gained significantly more adipose mass than controls due to a primary increase in both calorie consumption and adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite increased fat mass, Txnip knockout mice were markedly more insulin sensitive than controls, and augmented <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport was identified in both adipose and skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference gene-silenced preadipocytes and Txnip(-/-) MEFs were markedly adipogenic, whereas Txnip overexpression impaired adipocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As increased adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity suggested aspects of augmented peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) response, we investigated Txnip's regulation of PPARgamma function; manipulation of Txnip expression directly regulated PPARgamma expression and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Txnip deletion promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> in the face of high-fat caloric excess; however, loss of this alpha-arrestin protein simultaneously enhances insulin responsiveness in fat and skeletal muscle, revealing Txnip as a novel mediator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and a regulator of adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
