<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MODY can result from heterozygous mutations in at least five genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether alterations in known MODY genes and two MODY candidate genes contribute to the development of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The coding regions of the known MODY genes hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha, HNF-4alpha, HNF-1beta, and insulin promoter factor 1 and the coding regions of two MODY candidate genes, HNF-3beta and the dimerization cofactor of HNF-1, were sequenced in genomic DNA from Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary "affected" study population consisted of 46 Pima Indians whose age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was &lt; or =20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence variants identified in the affected group were then analyzed in a group of 80 "unaffected" Pima Indians who were at least 40 years old and had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 11 polymorphisms were detected in these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, none of the polymorphisms differed in frequency among Pima Indians with an early age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with older Pima Indians with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in these known MODY or MODY candidate genes are not a common cause of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
