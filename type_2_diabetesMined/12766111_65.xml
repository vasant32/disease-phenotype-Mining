<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantify the annual medical costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and its complications among people with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-of-illness model was used to estimate the numbers of diabetic individuals in the U.S. who have diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (DPN) and/or neuropathic foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (both those with no deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and those accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo>) at a given point in time, and/or a toe, foot, or leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> during a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence and incidence rates were estimated from published studies and applied to the general U.S. population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> costs were estimated in 2001 U.S. dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a sensitivity analysis, we varied the rates of complications to assess the robustness of the cost estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual costs of DPN and its complications in the U.S. were 0.8 billion US dollars (type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), 10.1 billion US dollars (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), and 10.9 billion US dollars (total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After allowing for uncertainty in the point estimates of complication rates, the range of costs were between 0.3 and 1.0 billion US dollars (type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), 4.3b and 12.7 billion US dollars (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), and 4.6 and 13.7 billion US dollars (type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The total annual cost of DPN and its complications in the U.S. was estimated to be between 4.6 and 13.7 billion US dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Up to 27% of the direct medical cost of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be attributed to DPN </plain></SENT>
