<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our secondary aim was to investigate how the MI risk associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> differs between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort study using the General Practice Research Database (1992-1999) was carried out, selecting 40,727 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 194,913 age and sex-matched patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of MI in men and women with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were derived, as were hazard ratios for MI adjusted for known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of MI in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 19.74 (95% CI 18.83-20.69) per 1,000 person-years compared with 16.18 (95% CI 15.33-17.08) per 1,000 person-years in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall adjusted relative risk of MI in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> versus no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.13 (95% CI 2.01-2.26) in men and 2.95 (95% CI 2.75-3.17) in women and decreased with age in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 35 to 54 years were at almost five times the risk of MI compared with women of the same age without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 4.86 [95% CI 2.78-8.51]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study has demonstrated that women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at a much greater relative risk of MI than men even when adjusted for risk factors </plain></SENT>
