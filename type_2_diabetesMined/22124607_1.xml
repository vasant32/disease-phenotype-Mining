<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The insulin receptor can serve as a substrate for the protein tyrosine phosphatase (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>) 1B and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), which share a striking 74% sequence identity in their catalytic domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PTP1B is a validated therapeutic target for the alleviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTP1B dephosphorylates the insulin receptor in liver and muscle to regulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, whereas TCPTP regulates insulin receptor signalling and gluconeogenesis in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we assessed for the first time the role of TCPTP in the regulation of insulin receptor signalling in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We generated muscle-specific TCPTP-deficient (Mck-Cre;Ptpn2(lox/lox)) mice (Mck, also known as Ckm) and assessed the impact on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and muscle insulin receptor signalling in chow-fed versus high-fat-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels, insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, and insulin-induced muscle insulin receptor activation and downstream PI3K/Akt signalling remained unaltered in chow-fed Mck-Cre;Ptpn2(lox/lox) versus Ptpn2(lox/lox) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, body weight, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis were not altered in high-fat-fed Mck-Cre;Ptpn2(lox/lox) versus Ptpn2(lox/lox) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that TCPTP deficiency in muscle has no effect on insulin signalling and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, and does not prevent high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite their high degree of sequence identity, PTP1B and TCPTP contribute differentially to insulin receptor regulation in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with the notion that these two highly related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTPs</z:chebi> make distinct contributions to insulin receptor regulation in different tissues </plain></SENT>
