<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is a persistent perception that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50114">oestrogens</z:chebi> have an adverse effect on carbohydrate metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It might therefore be expected that their use would result in a corresponding increase in the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence from clinical trials suggesting that women on postmenopausal <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have a reduced incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therefore appears paradoxical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short-term supraphysiological <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> administration has an adverse effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, resulting from suppression of first-phase insulin secretion and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">Oestrogen</z:chebi>-induced increases in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> activity could account for these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">Oestrogen</z:chebi>-induced deterioration in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance is, however, accompanied by a reduction in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, an effect that could be accounted for by glucagon antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These short-term effects contrast with long-term preservation of insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50114">oestrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animal studies, ovariectomy is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> and increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> administration protects against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and increases the insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism is uncertain, but direct effects on the pancreas via steroid receptors or indirect effects via <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>-induced glucagon antagonism and subclinical increases in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> and growth hormone could <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contribute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence that HRT increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> suggests that it should not be used for the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the mechanism responsible for this benefit merits further investigation and might lead to new therapies </plain></SENT>
