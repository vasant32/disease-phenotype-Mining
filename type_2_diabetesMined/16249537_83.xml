<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether patients with comorbid minor and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a higher mortality rate over a 3-year period compared with patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a large health maintenance organization (HMO), 4,154 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were surveyed and followed for up to 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients initially filled out a written questionnaire, and HMO-automated diagnostic, laboratory, and pharmacy data and Washington State mortality data were collected to assess <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for each group compared with the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 275 (8.3%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 3,303 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> compared with 48 (13.6%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 354 patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and 59 (11.9%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 497 patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A proportional hazards model with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment found that compared with the nondepressed group, minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was associated with a 1.67-fold increase in mortality (P = 0.003), and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was associated with a 2.30-fold increase (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second model that controlled for multiple potential mediators, both minor and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> remained significant predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, both minor and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> are strongly associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research will be necessary to disentangle causal relationships among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, behavioral risk factors (adherence to medical regimens), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, and mortality </plain></SENT>
