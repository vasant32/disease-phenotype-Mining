<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting analog of human insulin that can be used to target the postprandial rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed an open-label randomized crossover study of type 2 diabetic patients with secondary failure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy to determine whether improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> would affect total daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five type 2 diabetic patients who were poorly controlled on a maximum dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> were studied in a university hospital clinical research center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one arm of the study, patients continued therapy with maximum-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other arm, patients used a combination therapy with insulin lispro before meals and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 4 months, patients were crossed over to the opposite arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and 1- and 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (after a standardized meal), HbA1c, total, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were measured at the end of each arm of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin lispro in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy significantly reduced 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> alone, from 18.6 to 14.2 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.0001), and incremental postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area from 617.8 to 472.9 mmol.min.1-1 (P &lt; 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FPG levels were decreased from 10.9 to 8.5 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.0001), and HbA1c values were reduced form 9.0 to 7.1% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol was significantly decreased in the lispro arm from 5.44 to 5.10 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations were increased in the lispro arm from 0.88 to 0.96 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients weighed significantly more after lispro therapy than after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> alone, but the difference was small in absolute terms (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy alone, 90.6 kg; lispro therapy, 93.8 kg; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, &lt; 2.8 mmol/l) were reported by the patients while using lispro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Previously, it has not been possible to address the effect of treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We have now shown that the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> with insulin lispro markedly improves overall <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and some <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
