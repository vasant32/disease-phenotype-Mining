<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) have been widely studied, but few studies have considered multiple measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to integrate several potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> predictors with consideration to both simple and novel measures and to determine the extent to which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> can be predicted in the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified first-trimester maternal samples from 124 women who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and 248 control subjects who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We gathered data on age, BMI, parity, race, smoking, prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using retrieved samples, we measured routine (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and γ-glutamyltransferase) and novel (adiponectin, E-selectin, and tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]) parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We determined independent predictors from stepwise regression analyses, calculated areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC-ROC), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) for relevant models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, women who subsequently developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> were older, had higher BMIs, were more likely to be of Asian origin, had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> or family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and had higher systolic blood pressure (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard biochemical measures, stepwise analyses identified only elevated t-PA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels as significant (P ≤ 0.015) independent predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> beyond simple non-laboratory-based maternal measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their inclusion improved the AUC-ROC from 0.824 to 0.861 and IDI by 0.052 (0.017-0.115) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> can be usefully estimated from a mix of simple questions with potential for further improvement by specific blood measures (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and t-PA) </plain></SENT>
