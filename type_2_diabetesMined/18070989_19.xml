<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Women with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who drank &gt;or=4 cups of coffee per day had significantly higher adiponectin concentrations than those who didn't drink coffee regularly (7.7 vs. 6.1 microg/ml, respectively, in diabetic women, P = 0.004; 15.0 vs. 13.2 microg/ml in nondiabetic women, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
