<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unclear whether both pathophysiological features are inseparably combined and which is the outstanding determinant in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, insulin sensitivity (calculated as M value divided by insulin [M/I]) and beta cell function were studied in the offspring of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 187; 57% females; age 43.8 +/- 8.1 years; BMI 26.8 +/- 4.5 kg/m(2)) and in individuals without a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (controls, n = 519, 55% females; age 43.4 +/- 8.2 years; BMI 26.4 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2), no significant differences between the groups for any characteristic) by performance of 75 g OGTT and 2 h hyperinsulinaemic (40 mU min(-1) m(-2))-isoglycaemic clamp tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta cell function was evaluated by calculating insulinogenic index (IGI) from C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> AUC:<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC ratios from the first hour of OGTT (IGI[60 min]) and from the total OGTT (IGI[120 min]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the OGTT, the offspring of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed 4-14% higher plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from 30 to 120 min (p &lt; 0.05) and 20-29% higher serum insulin from 90 to 120 min, but decreased IGI(60 min) and IGI(120 min) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M/I was 11% lower in the offspring of affected individuals than in controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To study the offspring of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with insulin sensitivity similar to that of the control group, the offspring of affected patients were divided into M/I quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those in the third M/I quartile showed M/I values and major anthropometric characteristics similar to those of the controls, but insulin AUC and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> AUC values were lower in the first hour and the total OGTT (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The third M/I quartile had lower IGI values at 60 min and 120 min: 11% and 14% lower, respectively (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The first-degree offspring of type 2 diabetic patients show <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Beta cell impairment exists in insulin-sensitive offspring of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> to be a major defect determining <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development in diabetic offspring </plain></SENT>
