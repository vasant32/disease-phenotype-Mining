<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of a 14-month progressive resistance training (PRT) program on endothelial function in both a supervised training (Center) group and non-supervised training (Home) group of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 28 men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who participated in a 14-month PRT involving an initial 2-month supervised program and a 12-month maintenance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endothelial function testing was performed through laser doppler flow responses in the skin microcirculation to iontophoresis of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (NaNP) and doses of 4, 8 and 16mC were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of vascular response (VR), HbA1c, weight and blood pressure were performed at 0, 2 and 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and NaNP was significantly increased at 14 months compared with baseline in both the Center and Home groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no between-group differences were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between HbA1c and VR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> at baseline and 8 weeks using 8mC dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between HbA1c at baseline and VR at 14 months using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> (4mC:r=-0.546, p=0.003, 8mC:r=-0.470, p=0.002, 16mC:r=-0.547, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Endothelial function is improved following 14 months of PRT in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> both in a supervised and non-supervised program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strong correlations with HbA1c including initial HbA1c levels suggest that glycemic control may be an important factor in long-term regulation of endothelial function </plain></SENT>
