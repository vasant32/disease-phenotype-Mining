<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> in utero and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in healthy children and to investigate whether these associations are independent of maternal prepregnancy BMI and offspring attained BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were from a retrospective cohort of children aged 6-13 years born during 1994-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was used to examine the associations between exposure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> with adjustment for demographic factors and pubertal stage and additionally for maternal prepregnancy BMI and offspring attained BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-nine offspring of diabetic pregnancies had significantly increased E-selectin, vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (VCAM1), leptin, waist circumference, BMI and systolic blood pressure and <z:mp ids='MP_0004893'>decreased adiponectin levels</z:mp> compared with 422 offspring of non-diabetic pregnancies after adjustment for age, sex and race/ethnicity (p &lt; 0.05 for each risk factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustment for maternal prepregnancy BMI substantially attenuated group differences in the risk factors except for E-selectin, VCAM1 and waist circumference, which remained significantly higher in exposed children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Compared with unexposed children, healthy offspring exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> in utero have a worse cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, offspring have substantially increased levels of circulating cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, which are biomarkers of adverse endothelium perturbation and may be related to the earliest preclinical stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
