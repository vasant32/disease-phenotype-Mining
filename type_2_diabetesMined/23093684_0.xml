<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 15,773) visiting consecutively 19 hospital-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics in years 2007 and 2008 were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DR was assessed by dilated fundoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CKD was defined based on <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CKD was present in 58.64% of subjects with advanced DR, whereas advanced DR was detectable only in 15.28% of individuals with any CKD and correlated with the albuminuric CKD phenotypes more than with the nonalbuminuric phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, male sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and, inversely, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> correlated independently with the presence of any CKD in individuals with advanced DR; correlates differed according to the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, reduced eGFR, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, factors associated with the presence of advanced DR in subjects with any CKD were <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment, previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, and, inversely, smoking, eGFR, and age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concordance of CKD with advanced DR is low in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and CKD without advanced DR is more frequent than isolated advanced DR, at variance with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors independently associated with the presence of any CKD in individuals with advanced DR differ, at least in part, from those correlating with the presence of advanced DR in subjects with any CKD and by CKD phenotype </plain></SENT>
