<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of exenatide on FGF21 in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in a diet-induced mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (DIO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients (n = 24) on diet and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were randomised (using a table of random numbers) to receive additional treatment consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 45 mg/day or combined therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg/day) and exenatide (10 μg twice daily) for 12 months in an open label parallel study at the Baylor Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients completed the entire study and were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (n = 10) reduced hepatic fat as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, despite a significant increase in body weight (Δ = 3.7 kg); plasma FGF21 levels did not change (1.9  ±  0.6 to 2.2  ±  0.6 ng/ml [mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and exenatide therapy (n = 11) was associated with a significant reduction of FGF21 levels (2.3  ±  0.5 to 1.1  ±  0.3 ng/ml) and a greater decrease in hepatic fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-treated patients, lower extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was observed as a side effect in two of the ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and exenatide combination therapy complained of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> that was self-limiting and did not require them to leave the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In DIO mice, exendin-4 for 4 weeks significantly reduced hepatic triacylglycerol content, decreased hepatic FGF21 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and enhanced phosphorylation of hepatic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase, although no significant difference in weight and body fat was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hepatic FGF21 correlated inversely with hepatic AMPK phosphorylation CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and exenatide therapy is associated with a reduction in plasma FGF21 levels, as well as a greater decrease in hepatic fat than that achieved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In DIO mice, exendin-4 treatment reduces hepatic triacylglycerol and FGF21 protein, and enhances hepatic AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting an improvement of hepatic FGF21 resistance </plain></SENT>
