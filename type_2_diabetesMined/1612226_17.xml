<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The studies, performed in 1975 and 1976, found that Nauru had a higher prevalence of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> than Tuvalu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both studies included subjects of 8-29 years of age (n = 320 in Nauru, n = 318 in Tuvalu) and on these subjects <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, body mass index and fasting and 2-h (post 75 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load) plasma insulin concentrations were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Nauru, follow-up surveys in 1982 and 1987 included many of the subjects first seen in 1975/1976, allowing the incidence and natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> to be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the group of subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, there was no effect of age on plasma insulin distributions in either population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in both populations, 8-19 year old subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance had higher body mass index-adjusted geometric mean fasting and 2-h insulin concentrations than older age-groups (p less than 0.001 for fasting insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body mass index-adjusted geometric mean 2-h plasma insulin was higher in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> relative to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Nauruans, 2-h insulin levels at baseline were predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1982, and fasting and 2-h insulin levels predicted development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1987.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
