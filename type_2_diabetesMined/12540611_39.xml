<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The intestinally derived hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) (7-36 amide) has potent effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-mediated insulin secretion, insulin gene expression, and beta-cell growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, considered a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the dose-response relationship between GLP-1 and basal and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated prehepatic insulin secretion rate (ISR) is currently not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and seven matched nondiabetic control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ISR was determined during a graded <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) over 150 min on four occasions with infusion of saline or GLP-1 at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 enhanced ISR in a dose-dependent manner during the graded <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion from 332 +/- 51 to 975 +/- 198 pmol/kg in the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and from 711 +/- 123 to 2,415 +/- 243 pmol/kg in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The beta-cell responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, expressed as the slope of the linear relation between ISR and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, increased in proportion to the GLP-1 dose to 6 times relative to saline at the highest GLP-1 dose in the patients and 11 times in the control subjects, but it was 3 to 5 times lower in the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with healthy subjects at the same GLP-1 dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During infusion of GLP-1 at 0.5 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1) in the patients, the slope of ISR versus <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> became indistinguishable from that of the control subjects without GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that GLP-1 increases insulin secretion in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control subjects in a dose-dependent manner and that the beta-cell responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> may be increased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels with a low dose of GLP-1 infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the results also indicate that the dose-response relation between beta-cell responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and GLP-1 is severely impaired in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
