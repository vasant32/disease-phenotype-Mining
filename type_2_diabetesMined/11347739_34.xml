<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) examined a representative sample of the U.S. population, which included 2,867 adolescents aged 12-19 years who had serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 13 adolescents in the sample were considered to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 9 reported using insulin, 2 reported using oral agents only, and 2 did not report any treatment but had high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (&gt; or = 11.1 mmol/l regardless of length of fast or &gt; or = 7.0 mmol/l after an 8-h fast) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of these cases (31% of the sample with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) were considered to have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types) per 100 adolescents ages 12-19 years was 0.41% (95% confidence interval 0-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (&gt; or = 6.1 mmol/l) among adolescents without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had fasted for at least 8 h was 1.76% (0.02-3.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of elevated HbA1c (&gt;6%) was 0.39% (0.04-0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: National data reflect the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in U.S. adolescents, but the survey sample size was not large enough to obtain precise prevalence estimates because of the relatively low prevalence </plain></SENT>
