<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> commonly coexist, and prior studies have suggested better outcomes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> than other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed this study to determine whether this association reflects a beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or a harmful effect of other agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study nested within the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General Practice Research Database cohort in which diagnoses were assigned by each patient's primary care physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case subjects were patients 35 years or older, newly diagnosed with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after January 1988, and who died prior to October 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control subjects were matched to case subjects based on age, sex, clinic site, calendar year, and duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for comorbidities, A1C, renal function, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The duration of concurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was 2.8 years (SD 2.6) in our 1,633 case subjects and 1,633 control subjects (mean age 78 years, 53% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients who were not exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, the current use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (adjusted odds ratio 0.65 [0.48-0.87]) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with or without other agents (0.72 [0.59-0.90]) was associated with lower mortality; however, use of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs or insulin was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi>/angiotensin receptor blockers (0.55 [0.45-0.68]) and beta-blockers (0.76 [0.61-0.95]) were associated with reduced mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the benefits of trial-proven anti-failure therapies in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and support the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-based strategies to lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
