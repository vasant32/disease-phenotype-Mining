<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the insulin dose-response curves for suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (EGP) and stimulation of splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (SGU) differ in nondiabetic humans and are abnormal in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 14 nondiabetic and 12 diabetic subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> was clamped at approximately 9.5 mmol/l and endogenous hormone secretion inhibited by somatostatin, while glucagon and growth hormone were replaced by an exogenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin was progressively increased from approximately 150 to approximately 350 and approximately 700 pmol/l by means of an exogenous insulin infusion, while EGP, SGU, and leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (LGU) were measured using the splanchnic and leg catheterization methods, combined with a [3-3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic subjects, an increase in insulin from approximately 150 to approximately 350 pmol/l resulted in maximal suppression of EGP, whereas SGU continued to increase (P &lt; 0.001) when insulin was increased to approximately 700 pmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EGP progressively decreased (P &lt; 0.001) and SGU progressively increased (P &lt; 0.001) in the diabetic subjects as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin increased</z:e> from approximately 150 to approximately 700 pmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although EGP was higher (P &lt; 0.01) in the diabetic than nondiabetic subjects only at the lowest insulin concentration, SGU was lower (P &lt; 0.01) in the diabetic subjects at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulin concentrations tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in contrast to LGU and overall <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, the increment in SGU in response to both increments in insulin did not differ in the diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, implying a right shifted but parallel dose-response curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the dose-response curves for suppression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and stimulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake differ in nondiabetic subjects and are abnormal in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data also suggest that agents that enhance SGU in diabetic patients (e.g. glucokinase activators) are likely to improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
