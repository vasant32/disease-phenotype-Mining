<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leptin levels were similar both at baseline and after treatment in diabetic and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients with basal fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &lt; 10 mmol/l or with basal postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PPPG) &lt; 13.9 mmol/l had significantly higher leptin levels than diabetic patients with basal FPG &gt; or = 10 mmol/l or with basal PPPG &gt; or = 13.9 mmol/l (19.6+/-8.7 vs. 13.65+/-5.4 microg/l, p &lt; 0.05; and 20.2+/-7.9 vs. 12.9+/-5.2 microg/l, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delta leptin showed a weak correlation with basal FPG (r = 0.346; p &lt; 0.05), basal and post-treatment PPPG (r = 0.335, p &lt; 0.05 and r = 0.325, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) and a moderate correlation with post-treatment FPG (r = 0.391, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
