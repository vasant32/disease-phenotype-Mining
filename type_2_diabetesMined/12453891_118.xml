<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A two- to threefold elevation of circulating IL-6 has been observed in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, little evidence supports a direct role for IL-6 in mediating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we present data that IL-6 can inhibit insulin receptor (IR) signal transduction and insulin action in both primary mouse hepatocytes and the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatocarcinoma</z:e> cell line, HepG2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This inhibition depends on duration of IL-6 exposure, with a maximum effect at 1-1.5 h of pretreatment with IL-6 in both HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IL-6 effect is characterized by a decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR substrate (IRS)-1 and decreased association of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-1 in response to physiologic insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, insulin-dependent activation of Akt, important in mediating insulin's downstream metabolic actions, is markedly inhibited by IL-6 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, a 1.5-h preincubation of primary hepatocytes with IL-6 inhibits insulin-induced <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis by 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that IL-6 plays a direct role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> at the cellular level in both primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cell lines and may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
