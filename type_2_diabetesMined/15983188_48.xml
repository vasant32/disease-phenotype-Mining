<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human epidemiological studies and appropriately designed dietary interventions in animal models have provided considerable evidence to suggest that maternal nutritional imbalance and metabolic disturbances, during critical time windows of development, may have a persistent effect on the health of the offspring and may even be transmitted to the next generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now need to explain the mechanisms involved in generating such responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The idea that epigenetic changes associated with chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression underlie the developmental programming of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> is gaining acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic alterations have been known to be of importance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> for approximately 2 decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This has made it possible to decipher epigenetic codes and machinery and has led to the development of a new generation of drugs now in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although less conspicuous, epigenetic alterations have also been progressively shown to be relevant to common diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes, with their key roles in controlling feto-placental nutrient supply and demand and their epigenetic lability in response to nutrients, may play an important role in adaptation/evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of these various lines of research on epigenetic programming processes has highlighted new possibilities for the prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
