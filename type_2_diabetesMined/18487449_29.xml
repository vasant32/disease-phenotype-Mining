<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Accumulation of intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets (LDs) in non-adipose tissues is recognized as a strong prognostic factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LDs are coated with perilipin, adipose differentiation-related protein, tail interacting protein of 47 kd (PAT) proteins that are thought to regulate LD turnover by modulating lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis is that PAT proteins modulate LD metabolism and therefore <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a cell culture model (murine AML12 loaded with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi>) and small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> to directly assess the impact of PAT proteins on LD accumulation, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, and insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PAT proteins associated with excess fat deposited in livers of diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (DIO) mice were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cells lacking PAT proteins exhibited a dramatic increase in LD size and a decrease in LD number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the lipolytic rate increased by approximately 2- to 2.5-fold in association with increased adipose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> lipase (ATGL) at the LD surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of PAT proteins also produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, as indicated by decreased insulin stimulation of Akt phosphorylation (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">Phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-dependent kinase-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase decreased, and insulin receptor substrate-1 307 phosphorylation increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in DIO mice livers were accompanied by changes in PAT composition but also increased ATGL, suggesting a relative PAT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data establish an important role for PAT proteins as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> at the LD surface, packaging <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in smaller units and restricting access of lipases and thus preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a deficiency of PAT proteins relative to the quantity of ectopic fat could contribute to cellular dysfunction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
