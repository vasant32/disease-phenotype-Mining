<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the association of cellular mtDNA content and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we produced L6 GLUT4myc myocytes depleted of mtDNA by long-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">EtBr</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>L6 GLUT4myc cells cultured with 0.2 microg/ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">EtBr</z:chebi> (termed depleted cells) revealed a marked decrease in cellular mtDNA, concomitant with a lack of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> encoded by mtDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the mtDNA-depleted cells showed a drastic decrease in basal and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, indicating that L6 GLUT4myc cells develop impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The repletion of mtDNA normalized basal and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma membrane (PM) GLUT4 in the basal state was decreased, and the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the PM was drastically reduced by mtDNA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression of IRS-1 associated with insulin signaling was decreased by 90% in the depleted cells, and the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt2/PKB were drastically reduced in the depleted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those changes returned to control levels after mtDNA repletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that PM GLUT4 content and insulin signal pathway intermediates are modulated by the alteration of cellular mtDNA content, and the reduction in the expression of IRS-1 and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt2/PKB are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the mtDNA-depleted L6 GLUT4myc myocytes </plain></SENT>
