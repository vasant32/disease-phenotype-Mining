<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the cumulative incidence, concordance rate and heritability for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in a nationwide cohort of 13,888 Finnish twin pairs of the same sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The twins were born before 1958 and both co-twins were alive in 1967 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were derived through computerized record linkage from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, the National Hospital Discharge Register and the National Drug Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Records were reviewed in order to assign a diagnostic category to the 738 diabetic patients identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients 109 had Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 505 Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo>, 24 secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 38 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and 16 remained unclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.4% in men and 1.3% in women aged 28-59 years and 9.3% and 7.0% in men and women aged 60 years and over, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence did not differ between monozygotic and dizygotic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concordance rate for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was higher among monozygotic (23% probandwise and 13% pairwise) than dizygotic twins (5% probandwise and 3% pairwise) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probandwise and pairwise concordance rates for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 34% and 20% among monozygotic twins and 16% and 9% in dizygotic twins, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heritability for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was greater than that for Type 2 where both genetic and environmental effects seemed to play a significant role </plain></SENT>
