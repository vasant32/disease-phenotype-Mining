<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The overwhelming majority of hospitalizations for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occur for treatment of comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed broad-based interventions to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care for patients hospitalized with cardiac conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A pre-post quasi-experimental study design was used to evaluate the implementation of two quality improvement interventions: 1) revision of the hospital's capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring form into a color-coded process control chart and 2) a clinical path for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a secondary diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interventions were implemented on the medical and surgical cardiac care units (not including the intensive care units on these services) of a tertiary academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A chart abstraction sample included 328 subjects with no exposure to the interventions and 336 subjects hospitalized after both interventions were implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Telephone surveys were conducted after discharge on 446 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (at least one <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt;400 mg/dl) and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (at least three consecutive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &gt;250 mg/dl) decreased from 12 and 17% preintervention to 6.6 and 10% postintervention (P = 0.017 and P = 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that 9% of the patients preintervention and 5% of the patients postintervention (P = 0.05) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nosocomial infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported receipt of self-care instruction varied from 44 to 69% on nine survey items preintervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postintervention linear regression slopes for receipt of self-care instruction were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> greater than preintervention slopes, but the differences did not achieve statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found that 40% of the patients had important <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our broad-based interventions were associated with a decreased frequency of prolonged and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and a decreased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nosocomial infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also identified opportunities to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care instruction before discharge and to address important knowledge deficits of patients </plain></SENT>
