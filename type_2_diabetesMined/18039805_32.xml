<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have already shown a relationship between skin autofluorescence and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, as well as the predictive value of skin autofluorescence for total and cardiovascular mortality in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the predictive value of skin autofluorescence for the development of microvascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At baseline, skin autofluorescence of 973 type 2 diabetic patients with well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was noninvasively measured with an autofluorescence reader </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aggregate clinical outcome was defined as the development of any <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated microvascular complication of 881 surviving patients, which was assessed at baseline and at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single end points were the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and (micro)<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years, baseline skin autofluorescence was significantly higher in patients who developed any microvascular complication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, or (micro)<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> but not in those who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed skin autofluorescence as a predictor for development of any microvascular complication along with A1C, for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> along with smoking, and for development of (micro)<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> together with sex, A1C, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Skin autofluorescence did not have predictive value for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, albeit <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first observation of skin autofluorescence measurement as an independent predictor of development of microvascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
