<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study compared cognition and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between type 2 diabetic patients and nondiabetic control subjects and assessed the relationship between cognition and MRI findings and blood pressure and metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 113 patients and 51 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI scans were rated for white matter lesions (WMLs), cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological test scores were divided into five cognitive domains and expressed as standardized Z values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with deep WMLs (P = 0.02), cortical (P &lt; 0.001) and subcortical (P &lt; 0.05) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, (silent) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P = 0.06), and impaired cognitive performance (attention and executive function, information-processing speed, and memory, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> did not affect the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the type 2 diabetic group, cognitive function was inversely related with WMLs, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (adjusted for age, sex, and estimated IQ), and there was a modest association with HbA1c and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was strongest for age, even more so than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not only associated with subcortical ischemic changes in the brain, but also with increased brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
