<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aims: During recent years, two strategies of incretin-based therapy [glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonism and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition] have entered the market for pharmacological management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A main indication for this therapy is as add-on to on-going <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who have insufficient glycaemic control with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare improvements in glycaemic control and changes in body weight, as well as adverse events, in comparable studies with incretin-based therapy as add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Studies having a duration of 16-30 weeks were identified from PubMed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: A total of 27 study groups in 21 studies fulfilled the criteria of examining incretin-based therapy as add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> at clinically recommended doses in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for 16-30 weeks; 7 of these used a short-acting GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (exenatide BID), 7 used longer acting GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (liraglutide or exenatide LAR), whereas 14 studies examined DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies, incretin-based therapy reduced HbA1c concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction in HbA1c was significantly greater in study groups with long-acting GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> than with the other two groups (both p &lt; 0.001), whereas there were no differences between exenatide BID and DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study groups, there was a negative linear correlation between baseline HbA1c and change in HbA1c (r = -0.70; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> also fell significantly more in study groups given liraglutide or exenatide LAR than in those given exenatide BID or DPP-4 inhibitors (both p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, body weight was reduced by a similar extent in the two groups with GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and was not significantly altered in the groups with DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure and heart rate were not reported consistently, which did not allow general conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were rare, apart from increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> with GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Incretin-based therapy efficiently improves glycaemia when added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and within 16-30 weeks there is a more pronounced reduction in HbA1c with long-acting GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (liraglutide and exenatide LAR) than with exenatide BID and DPP-4 inhibitors, although the magnitude of the effect is dependent on the baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both strategies appear to be associated with a very low risk of adverse events, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, the injectable GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> also reduce body weight (whereas the DPP-4 inhibitors are weight neutral) but are also associated with a greater incidence of gastrointestinal side effects and a tendency to increase heart rate </plain></SENT>
