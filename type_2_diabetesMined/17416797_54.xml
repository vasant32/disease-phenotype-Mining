<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rapidly accumulating evidence shows that common T-cell transcription factor (TCF)7L2 polymorphisms confer risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through unknown mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between four TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs7903146, and measures of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in 1,697 Europid men and women of the population-based MRC (Medical Research Council)-Ely study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The T-(minor) allele of rs7903146 was strongly and positively associated with fasting proinsulin (P = 4.55 x 10(-9)) and 32,33 split proinsulin (P = 1.72 x 10(-4)) relative to total insulin levels; i.e., differences between T/T and C/C homozygotes amounted to 21.9 and 18.4% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, the insulin-to-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio (IGR) at 30-min oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), a frequently used surrogate of first-phase insulin secretion, was not associated with the TCF7L2 SNP (P &gt; 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the insulin response (IGR) at 60-min OGTT was significantly lower in T-allele carriers (P = 3.5 x 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T-allele was also associated with higher A1C concentrations (P = 1.2 x 10(-2)) and reduced beta-cell function, assessed by homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (P = 2.8 x 10(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for the other TCF7L2 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of note, both major genes involved in proinsulin processing (PC1, PC2) contain TCF-binding sites in their promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the TCF7L2 risk allele may predispose to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by impairing beta-cell proinsulin processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk allele increases proinsulin levels and diminishes the 60-min but not 30-min insulin response during OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The strong association between the TCF7L2 risk allele and fasting proinsulin but not insulin levels is notable, as, in this unselected and largely normoglycemic population, external influences on beta-cell stress are unlikely to be major factors influencing the efficiency of proinsulin processing </plain></SENT>
