<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been interpreted as amino acids causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in healthy people, and contributing to it in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of hyperaminoacidaemia on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in type 2 diabetic individuals remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent a two-step hyperinsulinaemic-hyperglycaemic (8 mmol/l) clamp, first with amino acids at postabsorptive concentrations, followed by postprandial concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover was assessed using D: -[3-(3)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained at baseline and during each step of the clamp to determine the phosphorylation states of AKT, mTOR, ribosomal protein (rp) S6, and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion (1.30 ± 0.19 vs 1.15 ± 0.13 mmol/min), endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (0.48 ± 0.06 vs 0.53 ± 0.05 mmol/min) and disposal (1.24 ± 0.17 vs 1.17 ± 0.14 mmol/min) did not differ between postabsorptive and postprandial amino acid concentrations (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas phosphorylation of AKT(Ser473), AKT(Thr308) mTOR(Ser2448) and rpS6(Ser235/236) increased (p &lt; 0.05) with elevated amino acids, that of IRS-1(Ser636/639) and IRS-1(Ser1101) did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Postprandial circulating amino acid concentrations do not worsen the already attenuated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in hyperglycaemic type 2 diabetic men, and cell-signalling events are consistent with this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results do not support recommendations to restrict dietary protein in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
