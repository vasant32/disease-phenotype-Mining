<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were from routine clinical practice in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The weight trend was determined for each year from 1995 to 2010 for both prevalent and incident cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline weight was compared to absolute (mean Δ) and relative weights (% Δ) at 6, 12 and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean, standardized weight in prevalent cases increased from 83.4 to 92.1 kg for males and from 73.5 to 79.9 kg for females between 1995 and 2010 (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For incident cases, the respective figures were 86.7 to 93.6 kg for males and 76.0 to 80.7 kg for females (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between baseline and 6, 12 and 24 months, there were significant changes in weight for the majority of the treatment regimens selected for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The largest weight increase at 12 months was for the patients who were prescribed a combination therapy with insulin and a thiazolidinedione, with a median increase of 4.1 kg (95% CI -0.60 to 8.0, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The largest weight decrease at 12 months was for the patients who were prescribed a combination therapy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and exenatide, with a median decrease of -7.0 kg (95% CI -12.0 to -2.0, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a continual increase in body weight in people with T2DM over time, and considerable differences in the impact on weight using alternative treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the same time, glycaemic control remained relatively unchanged </plain></SENT>
