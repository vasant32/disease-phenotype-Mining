<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed to examine the serum levels of IL-17A and IFN-gamma as antagonistic cytokines in nephropathic and non-nephropathic type-2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this experimental study, serum samples were obtained from 180 type-2 diabetic patients, 100 nephropathic type-2 diabetic patients and 100 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-17A and IFN-gamma was detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of this study showed that the serum level of IFN-gamma was higher in both diabetic patients (nephropathic and non-nephropathic) in comparison to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of IL-17A, while non-nephropathic type-2 diabetic patients showed an increased serum level of it, the other patients group had a lower serum level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the lower serum level of IL-17A is possibly associated with nephropathic complications of type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
