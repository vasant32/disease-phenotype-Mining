<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the context of the QuED (Quality of Care and Outcomes in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) project, we evaluated the longitudinal changes over 3 years in quality of life (QoL) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to the presence or the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> (ED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were requested to fill in a questionnaire investigating the presence of ED and QoL (SF-36 Health Survey, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>], and quality of sexual life) every 6 months for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analyses were based on multilevel models, adjusted for patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study involved 1,456 patients, of whom 34% reported frequent erectile problems at baseline; 192 developed ED during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No changes in QoL measures were detected in patients without ED; in those with ED at baseline, a worsening in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SF-36 scales was observed, reaching statistical significance for physical functioning (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients who developed ED during the study, a deterioration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SF-36 dimensions and a worsening in depressive symptoms preceded the development of ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ED was associated with a further marked worsening in physical functioning (P = 0.0008), general health perception (P = 0.02), and social functioning (P = 0.04) on SF-36 subscales, as well as in the summary physical and mental components scores (P = 0.04 and P = 0.07, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of ED was also associated with a highly significant increase in depressive symptoms (P = 0.001) and a marked decrease in quality of sexual life (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study documents for the first time the impact of ED <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> on several aspects of QoL in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study also shows that QoL tended to further decrease during 3 years in patients with ED at baseline but not in those without this condition </plain></SENT>
