<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between glycemic variability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 59 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 64.2 +/- 8.6 years, A1C 6.5 +/- 1.0%, and BMI 29.8 +/- 3.8 kg/m(2)[mean +/- SD]) using either oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs) (n = 34) or diet alone (nonusers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a measure of glycemic variability, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) was computed from continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring data recorded over 3 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationships between MAGE, beta-cell function, and clinical parameters were assessed by including postprandial beta-cell function (PBCF) and basal beta-cell function (BBCF) obtained by a model-based method from plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during a mixed-meal test as well as homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity, clinical factors, carbohydrate intake, and type of OHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MAGE was nonlinearly correlated with PBCF (r = 0.54, P &lt; 0.001) and with BBCF (r = 0.31, P = 0.025) in OHA users but failed to correlate with these parameters in nonusers (PBCF P = 0.21 and BBCF P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that PBCF and OHA combination treatment were independent contributors to MAGE (R(2) = 0.50, P &lt; 0.010), whereas insulin sensitivity, carbohydrate intake, and nonglycemic parameters failed to contribute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PBCF appears to be an important target to reduce <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuations in OHA-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
