<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore how and in which tissues they improve insulin action, we obtained fat and muscle biopsies from eight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before and 2 months after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 5) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TZD treatment was associated with a coordinated upregulation in the expression of genes and synthesis of proteins involved in fatty acid uptake, binding, beta-oxidation and electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation in subcutaneous fat but not in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes were accompanied by a 13% increase in total body fat oxidation, a 20% decrease in plasma free fatty acid levels, and a 46% increase in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TZDs induced a coordinated stimulation of fatty acid uptake, oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation in fat of diabetic patients and thus may have corrected, at least partially, a recently recognized defect in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consisting of reduced expression of genes related to oxidative metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
