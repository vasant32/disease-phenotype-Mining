<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the effects of topiramate on C-fiber function, nerve fiber <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and metabolism (including insulin sensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an 18-week, open-label trial treating patients with topiramate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (61.5 Â± 1.29 years; 15 male, 5 female) were enrolled and completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> was evaluated by total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> scores, nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory tests, laser Doppler skin blood flow, and intraepidermal nerve fibers in skin biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Topiramate treatment improved symptoms compatible with C-fiber dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight, blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler skin blood flow improved significantly after 12 weeks of treatment, but returned to baseline at 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 18 weeks of treatment there was a significant increase in intraepidermal nerve fiber length at the forearm, thigh, and proximal leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraepidermal nerve fiber density was significantly increased by topiramate in the proximal leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate that it is possible to induce skin intraepidermal nerve fiber regeneration accompanied by enhancement of neurovascular function, translating into improved symptoms as well as sensory nerve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous improvement of selective metabolic indices may play a role in this effect, but this remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
