<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examined whether intervention programs known to improve insulin sensitivity are paralleled by an increase in skeletal muscle UCP3 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Skeletal muscle UCP3 protein content was measured before and after one year of an exercise intervention in muscle biopsies of eight diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, UCP3 was measured in IGT subjects before and after 1 year of following a lifestyle-intervention program or serving as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the diabetic patients a significant increase of approximately 75% in UCP3 protein was found after 1 year of exercise training (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In IGT subjects UCP3 protein increased in the intervention group (P = 0.02), while UCP3 remained unaltered in the control group (P = 0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both, exercise training and a lifestyle-intervention program increase UCP3 protein content in skeletal muscle of subjects with reduced glycaemic control, indicating a restoration towards <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> UCP3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the idea that UCP3 has a role in the aetiology of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
