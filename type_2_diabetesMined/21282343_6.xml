<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The surgical option could represent a valid alternative to medical therapy in some diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no data are available on long-term effects of metabolic surgery on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who underwent bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD) had less micro- and macrovascular complications than those who received conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an unblinded, case-controlled trial with 10-years' follow-up, conducted from July 1998 through October 2009 at the Day Hospital of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Diseases</z:e>, Catholic University, Rome, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A consecutive sample of 110 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (BMI &gt;35 kg/m(2)) with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was completed by 50 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was long-term effects (10 years) of BPD versus those associated with conventional therapy on microvascular outcome, micro- and macroalbuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary measures included macrovascular outcomes, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remission, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten-year GFR variation was -45.7 ± 18.8% in the medical arm and 13.6 ± 24.5% in the surgical arm (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercreatininemia</z:e> prevalence was 39.3% in control subjects and 9% in BPD subjects (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 10 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BPD subjects recovered from <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> appeared or progressed to macroalbuminuria in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, determined by electrocardiogram, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After the 10-year follow-up, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) probability was 0.22 ± 0.10 and 0.05 ± 0.04 in the medical and surgical groups, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Remission from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients within 1 year of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surgical and medical subjects had lost 34.60 ± 10.25 and 0.38 ± 6.10% of initial weight at the 10-year follow-up (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Renal and cardiovascular complications were dramatically reduced in the surgical arm, indicating long-term benefits of BPD on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, at least in the case of morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with decompensated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
