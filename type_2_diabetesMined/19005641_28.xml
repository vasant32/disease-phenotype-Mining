<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study in Asian Indian Sikhs showed an association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that did not seem to be mediated through BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the association of FTO variants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in South Asian Indians in Pune </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped, by sequencing, two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs9939609 and rs7191344, in the FTO gene in 1,453 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and 1,361 controls from Pune, Western India and a further 961 population-based individuals from Mysore, South India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a strong association of the minor allele A at rs9939609 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR per allele 1.26; 95% CI 1.13-1.40; p = 3 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variant was also associated with BMI but this association appeared to be weaker (0.06 SDs; 95% CI 0.01-0.10) than the previously reported effect in Europeans (0.10 SDs; 95% CI 0.09-0.12; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike in the Europeans, the association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remained significant after adjusting for BMI (OR per allele for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 1.21; 95% CI 1.06-1.37; p = 4.0 x 10(-3)), and also for waist circumference and other anthropometric variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study replicates the strong association of FTO variants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and similar to the study in North Indians Sikhs, shows that this association may not be entirely mediated through BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This could imply underlying differences between Indians and Europeans in the mechanisms linking body size with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
