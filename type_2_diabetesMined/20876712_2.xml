<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively examined 38,031 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were free of diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alcohol consumption was reported on food frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,905 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred during 428,497 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 7.5 g/day (approximately half a glass) increase in alcohol consumption over 4 years was associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk among initial nondrinkers (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] 0.78; 95% CI: 0.60-1.00) and drinkers initially consuming &lt;15 g/day (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83-0.96), but not among men initially drinking â‰¥15 g/day (HR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.95-1.02; P(interaction) &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern was observed for levels of total adiponectin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), with a better metabolic profile among abstainers and light drinkers who modestly increased their alcohol intake, compared with men who either drank less or among men who were already moderate drinkers and increased their intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, compared with stable light drinkers (0-4.9 g/day), light drinkers who increased their intake to moderate levels (5.0-29.9 g/day) had a significantly lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.62-0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increases in alcohol consumption over time were associated with lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among initially rare and light drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This lower risk was evident within a 4-year period following increased alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
