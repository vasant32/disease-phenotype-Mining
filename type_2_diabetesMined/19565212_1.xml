<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients (ten women) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were on an intensified insulin therapy participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean (+/-SD) age was 63 +/- 10 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 18 +/- 9 years, BMI 32.5 +/- 5 kg/m(2), and HbA(1c) 7.3 +/- 0.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received neutral protamine Hagedorn (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine for at least 2 months; doses were adjusted to achieve morning blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of &lt;7 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the respective treatment period, the long-acting insulin was injected at bedtime (at 22:45 hours) as usual but patients refrained from breakfast and lunch the next day; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was measured by a continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system (CGMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparable <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> target ranges were reached at midnight (5.8 to 6.1 mmol/l) and at 07:00 hours (6.7 to 6.9 mmol/l) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three insulin preparations, using mean doses of 29 +/- 10 U (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin), 33 +/- 13 U (insulin detemir), and 32 +/- 12 U (insulin glargine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> levels between midnight and 07:00 hours were not significantly different for the three insulin preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> did not occur from 08:00 to 16:00 hours; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations during this time were slightly lower with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin than with insulin detemir (p = 0.012) and insulin glargine (p = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Following bedtime injection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin or of the analogues insulin detemir or insulin glargine, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;7 mmol/l was achieved in the morning, without subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> when participants continued to fast during the day </plain></SENT>
