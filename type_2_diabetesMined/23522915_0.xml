<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 1441 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were treated with insulin were obtained from a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained information on self-reported adherence to an insulin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative risk regression analysis was employed to assess the independent association of various demographic factors with good glycemic control (HbA1c&lt;7.0% [53mmol/mol]) while adjusting for possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age, body mass index, and number of daily insulin injections of participants were 65.4 years, 24.7kg/m(2), and 2.3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 70.6% reported high adherence to their insulin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with participants with higher adherence, the crude relative risk of good glycemic control was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00) for those with middle adherence and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.31-1.31) for those with lower adherence (P=0.029 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis confirmed this association in patients below 65 years old, but not in those 65 years old and over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A higher adherence to a daily insulin regimen was associated with a greater likelihood of good glycemic control in Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association was not seen in patients of 65 years old or over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Self-reported adherence to an insulin regimen may prove useful in titrating insulin dose in patients in the younger age group, but requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
