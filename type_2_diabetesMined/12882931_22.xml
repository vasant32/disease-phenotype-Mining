<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that plasma leptin may represent a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into the role of leptin in atherogenesis associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we investigated in the present study the role of this hormone in the regulation of macrophage <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL), a proatherogenic cytokine overexpressed in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of human macrophages with leptin (1-10 nmol/l) increased LPL expression, at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of these cells with anti-leptin receptor (Ob-R) antibody, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, calphostin C, and GF109203X, or the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) blocked the effects of leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed in leptin-treated J774 macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these cells, leptin increased the membrane expression of conventional PKC isoforms and downregulation of endogenous PKC expression abolished the effects of leptin on macrophage LPL expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In leptin-treated J774 cells, enhanced LPL synthetic rate and increased binding of nuclear proteins to the activated protein-1 (AP-1) consensus sequence of the LPL gene promoter were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This latter effect was abrogated by GF109203X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data demonstrate that binding of leptin at the macrophage cell surface increases, through <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>- and PKC-dependent pathways, LPL expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect appears to be exerted at the transcriptional level and to involve AP-1 activation </plain></SENT>
