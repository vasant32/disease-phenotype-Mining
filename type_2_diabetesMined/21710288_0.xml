<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first approach used the technique of dynamic assessment of the resistance index (RI) in the renal interlobar arteries before and after administration of sublingual <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate, and the second used MRI to assess total renal blood flow in relation to mean arterial pressure, thereby enabling direct measurement of overall renal RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of the first study raise the possibility that dynamic evaluation of the intra-renal RI could be used as an early detector of vascular alterations in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the second study suggest that decreases in renal blood flow in people with longstanding type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reflect intra-renal vascular stiffening and raise the possibility that in microalbuminuric patients it may also reflect increased intraglomerular pressure </plain></SENT>
