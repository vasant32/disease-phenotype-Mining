<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify the metabolic and hepatic markers associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women with a BMI of &lt;27 kg/m(2) and to compare them with those in individuals with a BMI of &gt;or=27 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Risk factors for 9 year incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were compared in the French Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (DESIR) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between the 2,947 participants with a BMI of &lt;27 kg/m(2) and the 879 with a BMI of &gt;or=27 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 92 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals with a BMI of &lt;27 kg/m(2) and 111 in those with a BMI of &gt;or=27 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among those who were not markedly overweight, classical biological markers were associated with 9 year incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, glycaemia being the strongest predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT), either considered as a continuous variable or at levels &gt;or=20 U/l, was associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with a stronger effect in the BMI &lt;27 kg/m(2) group: OR 1.59 (95% CI 1.29-1.97, p &lt; 0.001) in comparison with OR 1.07 (95% CI 0.82-1.38, p = 0.63) for those with a BMI of &gt;or=27 kg/m(2) (results after adjustment for alcohol intake, alanine aminotransferase, waist circumference and the HOMA <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In individuals with a BMI of &lt;27 kg/m(2), GGT was the strongest predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remained after adjustment for conventional markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, suggesting potential interactions between GGT, enhanced hepatic neoglucogenesis and/or early alterations of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
