<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>Increased BMI</z:mp> is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, including raised insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test whether FTO genotype is associated with variation in these metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested the association between FTO genotype and 10 metabolic traits using data from 17,037 white European individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the observed effect of FTO genotype on each trait to that expected given the FTO-BMI and BMI-trait associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each copy of the FTO rs9939609 A allele was associated with higher fasting insulin (0.039 SD [95% CI 0.013-0.064]; P = 0.003), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0.024 [0.001-0.048]; P = 0.044), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (0.028 [0.003-0.052]; P = 0.025) and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.032 [0.008-0.057]; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of these associations when adjusting for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations with fasting alanine aminotransferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi>-transferase, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, A1C, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were in the expected direction but did not reach P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metabolic traits, effect sizes were consistent with those expected for the per allele change in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FTO genotype was associated with a higher odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (odds ratio 1.17 [95% CI 1.10-1.25]; P = 3 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FTO genotype is associated with metabolic traits to an extent entirely consistent with its effect on BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sample sizes of &gt;12,000 individuals were needed to detect associations at P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the importance of using appropriately powered studies to assess the effects of a known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> variant on secondary traits correlated with these conditions </plain></SENT>
