<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once the diagnosis of definite <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was made, IRI response remained low after improvement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IRI response in equivocal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was variable, but almost always decreased in those who developed definite <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects with a strong family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the prevalence of a low IRI response was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In non-diabetic subjects, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> caused a marked increase in IRI response and a small increase in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, while in those who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, IRI increased little despite the marked increase in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that low IRI response is an important feature of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, perhaps with a hereditary basis in part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It precedes the occurrence of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and persists after improvement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
