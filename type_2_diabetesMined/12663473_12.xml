<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, Goto-Kakizaki (GK) diabetic rats were treated with the SSAO substrate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40538">benzylamine</z:chebi> and with low ineffective doses of vanadate previously shown to have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effects in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40538">benzylamine</z:chebi> in combination with vanadate in type 2 diabetic rats acutely stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment normalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport in adipocytes, and reversed muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40538">benzylamine</z:chebi>/vanadate also ameliorated insulin secretion in diabetic GK rats, and this effect was also observed in incubated pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In keeping with these observations, we also demonstrate that pancreatic islets express SSAO/VAP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As far as mechanisms of action, we have found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40538">benzylamine</z:chebi>/vanadate causes enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and reduced protein tyrosine phosphatase activity in adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, incubation of human recombinant SSAO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40538">benzylamine</z:chebi>, and vanadate generates peroxovanadium compounds in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we propose that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40538">benzylamine</z:chebi>/vanadate administration generates peroxovanadium locally in pancreatic islets, which stimulates insulin secretion and also produces peroxovanadium in adipose tissue, activating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in adipocytes and in neighboring muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This opens the possibility of using the SSAO/VAP-1 activity as a local generator of protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
