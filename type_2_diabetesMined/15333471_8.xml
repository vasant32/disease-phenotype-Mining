<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population was a convenience sample of women who were receiving prenatal care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women were systematically screened for both HCV and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 426 women were included in the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was detected in 13 (3.1% [95% CI 1.7-5.0]) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 22 (5.2%, [3.3-7.6]) women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had higher serum alanine aminotransferase activity compared with women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of 13 (30.8% [10.6-58.7]) HCV-infected women and 18 of 413 (4.4% [2.7-6.7]) women without evidence of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(odds ratio 9.8 [95% CI 2.4-34.0], Fisher's exact test P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model, increasing age (10-year increments), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (by standard deviations from the mean BMI), and positive HCV status were each independently related to the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among American-Indian women, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is more common in those with than in those without HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
