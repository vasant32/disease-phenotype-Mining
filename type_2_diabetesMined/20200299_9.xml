<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of subnormal <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a primary care clinic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations of 1,849 men (1,451 nondiabetic and 398 diabetic) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>Hypogonadism</z:hpo> In Males (HIM) study were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HIM study was a U.S.-based cross-sectional study designed to define the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> in men aged &gt;45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was measured by equilibrium dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations in lean, overweight, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic men was 26% (n = 275), 29% (n = 687), and 40% (n = 489), respectively (P &lt; 0.001 for trend), and 44% (n = 36), 44% (n = 135), and 50% (n = 227), respectively, in diabetic men (P = 0.46 for trend within group and P &lt; 0.05 compared with nondiabetic men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration of diabetic men was significantly lower than that of nondiabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations were negatively and significantly (P &lt; 0.001) related to age (r = -0.37), BMI (r = -0.18), and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (r = -0.11) in multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average decline of free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations was 7.8 pg/ml per decade in nondiabetic men and 8.4 pg/ml per decade in diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Forty percent of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic men and 50% of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic men aged &gt;or=45 years have subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In view of its high prevalence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is probably the condition most frequently associated with subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The concomitant presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with an additional increase in the prevalence of subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
