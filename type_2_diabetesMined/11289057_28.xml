<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have identified a common proline-to-alanine substitution (Pro12Ala) in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 (PPAR-gamma2), a nuclear receptor that regulates adipocyte differentiation and possibly insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Pro12Ala variant has been associated in some studies with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits and/or protection against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined this variant in 935 Finnish subjects, including 522 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 193 nondiabetic spouses, and 220 elderly nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the Pro12Ala variant was significantly lower in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (0.15 vs. 0.21; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits between subjects with and without the Pro12Ala variant within subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among diabetic subjects, the variant was associated with greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> after age 20 years (P = 0.023) and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diastolic blood pressure was higher in grossly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt;40 kg/m2) diabetic subjects with the variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic spouses, the variant was associated with higher fasting insulin (P = 0.033), systolic blood pressure (P = 0.021), and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support a role for the PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala variant in the etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
