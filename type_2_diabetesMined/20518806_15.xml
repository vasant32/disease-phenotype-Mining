<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With an insulin-independent mechanism of action, dapagliflozin is currently being developed for the treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This work aims to compare the efficacy of dapagliflozin, as measured by the change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c concentration (A1c) and body weight, and to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of dapagliflozin, as measured by urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion in early-stage and late-stage T2DM patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 151 early-stage patients and 58 late-stage patients with T2DM randomly assigned 10 or 20 mg once daily (QD) dapagliflozin treatment or placebo for 12 weeks from two phase 2 studies were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1c, body weight, and urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were compared between the two patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the early-stage population, patients in the late-stage population had a longer duration of T2DM and higher baseline levels of A1c, body weight, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, A1c reduction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and increased urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion from baseline were observed in both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline A1c level impacted the A1c reduction after dapagliflozin treatment with a comparable effect in patients with early and late stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late-stage patients had greater reduction in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion between the early-stage and late-stage patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin treatment at 10 and 20 mg QD for 12 weeks resulted in significant improvement in glycaemic control and body weight reduction in both early-stage and late-stage patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that dapagliflozin could be a promising treatment option for a wide range of patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
