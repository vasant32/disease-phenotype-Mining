<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we examined the effect of these genes' risk alleles on the age-dependent decline in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The SNPs rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs7754840(CDKAL1), rs7923837 (HHEX) and rs13266634 (SLC30A8) were genotyped in 1,412 non-diabetic patients, who were subsequently grouped according to their number of risk alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was assessed by validated indices and proinsulin conversion by calculating AUC(proinsulin)/AUC(insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of risk alleles revealed a Gaussian distribution, with most participants carrying four risk alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratification into groups with low (LAL, up to three alleles), median (MAL, four alleles) and high (HAL, five to eight alleles) allele load resulted in MAL and HAL participants displaying significantly lower insulin secretion and proinsulin conversion than LAL participants (p &lt;or= 0.0014 and p = 0.0185, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the overall cohort, age was negatively associated with insulin secretion and proinsulin conversion (both p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAL and HAL participants showed a significantly more pronounced decline in insulin secretion with increasing age than LAL participants (p &lt;or= 0.0325; analysis of covariance), and after stratification for BMI this relationship was maintained in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, but not non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin conversion decreased with increasing age in MAL and HAL, but not LAL, participants (p &lt;or= 0.0003 vs p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The risk allele load significantly accelerates the age-dependent decline in beta cell function, and this might be of particular importance in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people </plain></SENT>
