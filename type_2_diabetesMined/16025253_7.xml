<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported the use of a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha antisense oligonucleotide (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alphaAS) that inhibits up to 60% of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha expression in pancreatic islets, leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This oligonucleotide was used in this study to try to ameliorate diet-induced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a genetically predisposed mouse strain (Swiss mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance tests, euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp, immunoprecipitation assays, immunoblotting assays and immunohistochemistry were used in this investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Swiss mice became <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and overtly diabetic after 8 weeks of feeding with chow containing 24% saturated fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One daily dose (1.0 nmol) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alphaAS significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and increased insulin blood levels without affecting food intake and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were accompanied by a reduced area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve during an intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, an increased constant of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decay (K(itt)) during an insulin tolerance test, and an increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> consumption rate during a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mice treated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alphaAS presented an outstanding reduction of macroscopic and microscopic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were accompanied by reduced expression or function of a series of proteins involved in lipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha is an attractive target for pharmacological therapeutics in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
