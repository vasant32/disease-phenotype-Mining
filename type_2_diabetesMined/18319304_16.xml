<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that elevated EGFR phosphorylation contributes to resistance artery dysfunction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS AND RESULTS: Diabetic db/db and nondiabetic (control) mice were treated with EGFR inhibitor (AG1478; 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolated coronary artery and mesenteric resistance artery (MRA) were mounted in an arteriograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pressure-induced myogenic tone was increased in MRA and coronary artery from diabetic mice and normalized by AG1478 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced contraction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>-induced relaxation were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to shear stress and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> of MRA and coronary artery from diabetic mice was altered and associated with reduced endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) expression and phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treated diabetic mice with AG1478 improved coronary artery and MRA endothelial function and restored eNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining and Western blot analysis showed increased endothelial and smooth muscle cell EGFR phosphorylation of MRA and coronary artery from diabetic mouse, which was reduced by AG1478 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary cultured endothelial cells from resistance arteries treated with high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for 48 h showed an increase of EGFR phosphorylation associated with eNOS expression and phosphorylation decrease in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of endothelial cells with AG1478 prevented the effect of high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of the role of elevated EGFR phosphorylation in coronary artery and MRA dysfunction in diabetic db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, EGFR should be a potential target for overcoming diabetic small artery complications </plain></SENT>
