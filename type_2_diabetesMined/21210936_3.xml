<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a decrease in the activity of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), the enzyme which inactivates incretins, may explain the rise in incretin levels post-GBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma DPP-4 activity was measured after 10-kg equivalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> by GBP (n = 16) or by caloric restriction (CR,n = 14) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 activity decreased after GBP by 11.6% (p = 0.01), but not after CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased peak glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after GBP did not correlate with DPP-4 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease in fasting plasma DPP-4 activity after GBP occurred by a mechanism independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and did not relate to change in incretin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether the change in DPP-4 activity contributes to improved <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control after GBP remains therefore to be determined </plain></SENT>
