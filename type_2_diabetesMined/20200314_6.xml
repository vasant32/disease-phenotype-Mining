<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and show abnormalities in the coagulation cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether increased synthesis of tissue factor (TF) by platelets could contribute to the hypercoagulant state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Platelets from type 2 diabetic patients and matched control subjects were adhered to different surface-coated proteins, and TF premRNA splicing, TF protein, and TF procoagulant activity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Different adhesive proteins induced different levels of TF synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mimetic of active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> metabolite (AR-C69931 MX) reduced TF synthesis by 56 +/- 10%, an aspirin-like inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>) by 82 +/- 9%, and the combination by 96 +/- 2%, indicating that <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> release and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> A(2) production followed by activation of P2Y12 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> receptors mediate surface-induced TF synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interference with intracellular pathways revealed inhibition by agents that raise cAMP and interfere with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin is known to raise cAMP in platelets and inhibited collagen III-induced TF premRNA splicing and reduced TF activity by 35 +/- 5 and 47 +/- 5% at 1 and 100 nmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition by insulin was reduced in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> platelets resulting in an approximately 1.6-fold higher TF synthesis than in matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We characterized the extra- and intracellular mechanisms that couple surface activation to TF synthesis in adhering platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In healthy individuals, TF synthesis is inhibited by insulin, but in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inhibition is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This leads to the novel finding that platelets from type 2 diabetic patients produce more TF than platelets from matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
