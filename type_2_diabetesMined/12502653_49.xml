<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Strong Heart Study, a population-based study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and its risk factors in 13 American Indian communities in three geographic areas in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The baseline examination, conducted between July 1989 and January 1992, consisted of a personal interview, a physical examination, and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 4,549 women and men aged 45-74 years participating in the study, 2,108 had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on fatal and nonfatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were collected during the follow-up period through 31 December 1998 (average 9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariable analyses indicated that non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> is a strong predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in men and women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is particularly indicative of coronary events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios for the highest tertile of non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in men and women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (2.23 and 1.80, respectively) were higher than those for either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> alone in both men and women and were higher than the ratio of total/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The utility of non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> extended over a wide range of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> index may be particularly useful in predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
