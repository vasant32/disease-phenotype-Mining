<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore have evaluated the early steps in glucagon action by investigating the hormone-sensitive adenylyl cyclase system in liver membranes from seven Type 2 diabetic patients with fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and two-fold elevations in plasma glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comparison was made with seven control subjects matched for age, sex and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glucagon receptor binding was almost identical in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were, however, marked alterations in the adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes from the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This activity was reduced by 35-50% when compared to control activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basal cyclase activity, as well as the activity after stimulation with glucagon or with agents (i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28741">sodium fluoride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>) that act beyond the glucagon receptor, was significantly decreased (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, uncontrolled Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in associated with an over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loss of responsiveness of the hormone-sensitive adenylyl cyclase in human liver, which apparently results from post-receptor alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This change may provide a mechanism for reducing the effect of hyperglycagonaemia in Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
