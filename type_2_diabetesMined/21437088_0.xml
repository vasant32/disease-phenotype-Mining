<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Phase 1: We retrieved records of 50 Chinese, 51 Malay, and 67 Indian individuals who had routine health screening blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phase 2: We recruited 111 Chinese, 68 Malays, and 67 Indians with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and measured their hs-CRP in addition to standard laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phase 1: The median hs-CRP was 0.6 mg/L (0.2-6.2) in Chinese, 1.2 mg/L (0.2-7.9) in Malays, and 1.9 mg/L (0.2-10.0) in Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Indians had higher hs-CRP compared to Chinese (P &lt; 0.05) when adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and smoking, and a significant correlation was seen between female sex, smoking status, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration, and hs-CRP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three ethnicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase 2: The median hs-CRP was 1.2 mg/L (0.2-9.9) in Chinese, 2.2 mg/L (0.2-9.0) in Malays, and 2.3 mg/L (0.2-9.8) in Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indians had higher hs-CRP when compared to Chinese (P &lt; 0.05) and a significant correlation was seen between BMI, female gender, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and hs-CRP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three ethnicities (P &lt; 0.05) when adjusted for the above variables and use of aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi>/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, glinides, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: hs-CRP concentrations are significantly higher in Indians compared to the Chinese (in both the diabetic and nondiabetic individuals) after adjustment for the various demographic, metabolic, and therapeutic variables </plain></SENT>
