<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incretin hormones are intestinal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> that enhance postprandial insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) was initially thought to regulate gastric acid secretion, whereas glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) was discovered as a result of a systematic search for intestinal insulinotropic products of proglucagon gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incretin effect is markedly impaired or absent in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because of decreased secretion of GLP-1 and a loss of the insulinotropic effects of GIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic control can be restored or greatly improved by administration of exogenous GLP-1, but this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is almost immediately degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), and therefore has little clinical value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV-resistant analogues (incretin mimetics) have been identified or developed, and inhibitors of DPP-IV have also proved effective in protecting endogenous GLP-1 (and GIP) from degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both principles have been tested in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incretin mimetics, administered by sc injection, have demonstrated lasting improvement in HbA(1)c in patients insufficiently treated with conventional oral therapy, and their use has been associated with steady <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> for up to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DPP-IV inhibitors, given once or twice daily by mouth, also appear to provide lasting improvement in HbA(1)c, but are weight-neutral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first incretin mimetic has reached the market in the US, and applications for approval of the first inhibitors are expected to be filed early in 2006 </plain></SENT>
