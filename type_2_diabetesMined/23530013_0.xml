<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgically induced hormonal changes and the restrictive postoperative diet are proposed mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the contribution of caloric restriction versus surgically induced changes to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in the immediate postoperative period.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSPatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> planning to undergo RYGB participated in a prospective two-period study (each period involved a 10-day inpatient stay and periods were separated by a minimum of 6 weeks of wash-out) in which patients served as their own controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presurgery period consisted of diet alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postsurgery period was matched in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects (daily matched diet) and included RYGB surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> measurements were performed every 4 h throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mixed meal challenge test was performed before and after each period.RESULTSTen patients completed the study and had the following characteristics: age, 53.2 years (95% CI, 48.0-58.4); BMI, 51.2 kg/m(2) (46.1-56.4); <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, 7.4 years (4.8-10.0); and HbA1c, 8.52% (7.08-9.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients lost 7.3 kg (8.1-6.5) during the presurgery period versus 4.0 kg (6.2-1.7) during the postsurgery period (P = 0.01 between periods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Daily glycemia in the presurgery period was significantly lower (1,293.58 mg/dL*day [1,096.83-1,490.33) vs. 1,478.80 mg/dL*day [1,277.47-1,680.13]) compared with the postsurgery period (P = 0.02 between periods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The improvements in the fasting and maximum poststimulation <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 6-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve (primary outcome) were similar during both periods.CONCLUSIONSGlucose homeostasis improved in response to a reduced caloric diet, with a greater effect observed in the absence of surgery as compared with after RYGB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that reduced calorie ingestion can explain the marked improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control observed after RYGB </plain></SENT>
