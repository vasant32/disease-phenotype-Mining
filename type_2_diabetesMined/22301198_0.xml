<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> may be associated with the differential metabolic risk, and the distribution of abdominal adipose tissue was significantly altered in people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) compared to healthy people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study was performed to determine to the association between the regional abdominal adipose tissue distribution and serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels in people with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 699 people with type 2 DM and who had undergone abdominal computed tomography assessment of the visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat area were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels were measured by the uricase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>Hyperuricemia</z:hpo> was defined by cut-off value of &gt; 7 mg/dl for men and &gt; 6 mg/dl for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The visceral fat area was positively associated with the serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels after adjustment for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, serum albumin, serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (β-coefficient = 0.117, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression analysis showed that the visceral fat area was the significant independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> (OR 2.33, 95% CI, 1.21-4.50, p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But there was no significant association between the subcutaneous fat area and the serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels (β-coefficient = 0.061, p = 0.255) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: our data shows that the visceral fat area was positively associated with the serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels, but the subcutaneous fat area was not in people with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
