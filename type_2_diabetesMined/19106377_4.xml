<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study engine to estimate CHD risk for group-lifestyle and brief counseling (control) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between-group risk changes after 4 and 12 months were compared using ANCOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline 10-year risk was similar between treatment groups (P = 0.667) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4 and 12 months, the intervention group experienced significant decreases in 10-year risk from baseline (-3.28%, P &lt; 0.001; and -2.23%, P = 0.037) compared with control subjects (-0.78%, P = 0.339; and +1.88%, P = 0.073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between-group differences were statistically significant and increased from the 4- to 12-month visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Community-based delivery of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program lifestyle intervention could be a promising strategy to prevent both CHD and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults with pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
