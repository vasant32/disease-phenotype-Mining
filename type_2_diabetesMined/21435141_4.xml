<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment (single doses of 10-mg dapagliflozin fasted or fed), crossover study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in 14 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to the fasted state, a high-fat meal decreased mean dapagliflozin maximum plasma concentrations (C(max) ) by 31%, increased the time to C(max) (T(max) ) by 1 h, but did not affect overall dapagliflozin systemic exposure [area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the cumulative (daily) amount of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excreted in the urine induced by dapagliflozin is dependent upon dapagliflozin AUC, the effect of food on dapagliflozin C(max) is unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on dapagliflozin's efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, dapagliflozin can be administered without regard to meals </plain></SENT>
