<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVEWe investigated the factors that might influence the development of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSFrom January 2000 to December 2002, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 25-75 years without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) were consecutively recruited (n = 1,217) and followed-up in January 2011 and May 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (SH) was defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, hospitalization, or medical care in an emergency department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to test the association between SH episodes and potential explanatory variables.RESULTSAfter a median 10.4 years of follow-up, 111 (12.6%) patients experienced 140 episodes of SH, and the incidence was 1.55 per 100 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 55.3 ± 9.8 and 9.8 ± 6.5 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SH events was higher in older patients (P &lt; 0.001), in those with a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001), in those who used insulin (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (P = 0.003), and in those who had macroalbuminuria (P &lt; 0.001) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox hazard regression analysis revealed that SH was associated with longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the presence of macroalbuminuria (normoalbuminuria versus macroalbuminuria: hazard ratio, 2.52; 95% CI 1.31-4.84); P = 0.006).CONCLUSIONSThe development of SH was independently associated with duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and presence of macroalbuminuria, even with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
