<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few of these studies used the standard <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test to diagnose type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between coffee and green tea consumption and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status as determined using a 75-g OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 3224 male officials of the self-defence forces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status was determined in accordance with the 1998 World Health Organization criteria, and average intakes of coffee and green tea over the previous year were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The figures obtained were adjusted for BMI, physical activity and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1130 men were identified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (IFG, IGT or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with those who did not consume coffee on a daily basis, fasting and 2-h post-load plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were 1.5% and 4.3% lower in those who drank 5 cups of coffee or more per day respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> for categories of &lt;1, 1-2, 3-4 and &gt;/=5 cups of coffee per day were 1.0 (referent), 0.8 (95% CI 0.6-1.0), 0.7 (95% CI 0.6-0.9) and 0.7 (95% CI 0.5-0.9) respectively (p=0.0001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No clear association was observed between green tea drinking and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Coffee consumption may inhibit postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and thereby protect against the development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
