<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an important predictor of incident CHD among people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =126 mg/dl, random <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =200 mg/dl, or use of an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> or insulin) was assessed in participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the original and offspring cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 74 years, without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001993'>ketoacidosis</z:hpo>, and free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at the baseline evaluation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio of incident CHD events and mortality over a 12-year follow-up period; models were adjusted for known CHD risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 588 person-exams with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 58 +/- 9 years, 56% men), there were 86 CHD events, including 36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, and CHD risk factors, the risk of CHD was 1.38 times higher for each 10-year increase in duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (95% CI 0.99-1.92), and the risk for CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 1.86 times higher (1.17-2.93) for the same increase in duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increases the risk of CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> independent of coexisting risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research is necessary to understand the pathophysiology of this increased risk </plain></SENT>
