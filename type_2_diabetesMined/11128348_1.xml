<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the early biochemical predictors of increased susceptibility to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in offspring of African type 2 diabetic parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 69 offspring (case subjects) of 26 families in Cameroon with at least one type 2 diabetic parent were studied, and 62 offspring (control subjects) from 25 families in Cameroon with no parent with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early insulin secretion was calculated using the ratio of the 0- to 30-min incremental insulin values to the 0- to 30-min incremental <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric parameters were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the case subjects, 23% were <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> intolerant (4% with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 19% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT]) compared with 6.5% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with IGT) of control subjects (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also an increasing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, especially IGT with increasing number of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum insulin levels were not different in the two groups; however, at 30 min, the case subjects had lower insulin levels than the control subjects (P &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case subjects with IGT had lower 30-min insulin concentration, early insulin secretion, and 2-h insulin levels than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) (F = 4.1, P &lt; 0.05; F = 4.1, P &lt; 0.04; and F = 5.1, P &lt; 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, case subjects with NGT and IGT had lower early insulin secretion than control subjects (F = 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1, P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These differences remained after adjustment for BMI and regardless of the status of parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two-hour insulin concentration showed a positive association (odds ratio = 0.95 CI 0.90-0.99, P = 0.039) with IGT in the case subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and IGT are more prevalent in the offspring of African type 2 diabetic parents, and this may be due to an underlying degree of beta-cell impairment marked by reduced early-phase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
