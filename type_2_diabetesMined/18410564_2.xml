<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether reduction of both non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effects of exercise on these two components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (GDR, mg/kg/min) was evaluated in 37 type 2 diabetic (T2DM) and 17 non-diabetic (non-DM) subjects as the mean of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate during steady state in the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> oxidation rates were assessed by indirect calorimetry, and non-oxidative GDR was calculated by subtracting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation rate from GDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (IMCL) content of the soleus muscle was measured using (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 T2DM subjects, the changes in oxidative and non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during clamp were examined after 3-month exercise intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GDR (2.93 +/- 1.55 vs. 4.55 +/- 1.83, p = 0.001) and non-oxidative GDR (1.45 +/- 1.52 vs. 3.01 +/- 1.87, p = 0.002) were significantly lower in T2DM than in non-DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> oxidation rate was comparable in the two groups, and inversely correlated with IMCL (n = 15, r =-0.565, p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GDR (2.28 +/- 1.67 to 4.63 +/- 2.42, p = 0.021) and non-oxidative GDR (0.72 +/- 1.27 to 2.26 +/- 1.91, p = 0.047) were increased after exercise intervention, although the change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation rate was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, reduction of non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal may contribute to decreased whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, exercise improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> mainly by increasing non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
