<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene was initially reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Icelandic, Danish, and U.S. populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether TCF7L2 also has a role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The six variants reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Icelandic study were genotyped in a population-based sample of 3,501 Pima Indians (1,561 subjects had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 1,940 did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the coding and promoter regions of TCF7L2 were sequenced in 24 Pima subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The one variant identified by sequencing, 35 additional database variants positioned in introns, and the six variants reported in the Icelandic study were genotyped in Pima families to determine the haplotype structure of TCF7L2 among Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen representative variants were selected and genotyped in 3,501 Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The six variants initially reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were less common in Pima Indians compared with samples of European origin, and none were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One representative variant, rs1225404, was nominally associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a general model (additive P = 0.03, dominant P = 0.005) but not in a within-family analysis (additive P = 0.2, dominant P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, several variants were associated with BMI; in particular, rs12255372 was associated in both general and within-family analyses (both P = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modest associations were also found with traits predictive for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Variation within TCF7L2 does not confer major risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among the Pima Indian population </plain></SENT>
