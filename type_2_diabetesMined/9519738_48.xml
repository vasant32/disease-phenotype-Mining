<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The action of repaglinide, a novel insulin secretagogue, was compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> with regard to the hypoglycemic action in vivo, binding to betaTC-3 cells, insulin secretion from perifused mouse islets, and capacity to stimulate exocytosis by direct interaction with the secretory machinery in single voltage-clamped mouse beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two binding sites were identified: a high-affinity repaglinide (KD = 3.6 nmol/l) site having lower affinity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (14.4 nmol/l) and one high-affinity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (25 nmol/l) site having lower affinity for repaglinide (550 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, repaglinide (in concentrations as high as 5 micromol/l) lacked the ability to enhance exocytosis in voltage-clamped beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide was more potent than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> in stimulating insulin release from perifused mouse islets (EC50 29 vs. 80 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The greater potency of repaglinide in vitro was paralleled by similar actions in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ED50 values for the hypoglycemic action were determined to be 10.4 and 15.6 microg/kg after intravenous and oral administration, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> were 70.3 microg/kg (intravenous) and 203.2 microg/kg (oral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, repaglinide (1 mg/kg p.o.) was effective (P &lt; 0.001) as an insulin-releasing agent in a rat model (low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the insulinotropic actions of repaglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> in vitro and in vivo are secondary to their binding to the high-affinity repaglinide site and that the insulinotropic action of repaglinide involves both distinct and common cellular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
