<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis included 868 subjects (620 GDM and 248 single positive (SP) for one of the diagnostic criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The post-partum examinations included 2 h 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, anthropometric measurements, and documentation of medical history, diet, and lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were followed up at 6 weeks after parturition and subsequent follow-ups were conducted annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>General population subjects were identified from the 2001 Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey and age-matched for case-control analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven (4.4%) and 71 (11.5%) subjects in the SP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> groups, respectively, developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while 22 (2.5%) subjects in the general population group presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 3.5 times greater for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects than for general population subjects, after adjusting for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression model revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and waist circumference were independently associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> women in Korea are at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> irrespective of the absence of putative risk factors </plain></SENT>
