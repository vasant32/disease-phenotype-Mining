<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the putative association between these polymorphisms and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related metabolic traits in Danish individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The previously associated polymorphisms were genotyped in the population-based Inter99 cohort (n=6162), the Danish ADDITION study (n=8428), a population-based sample of young healthy participants (n=377) and in additional type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=2107) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant participants (n=483) using Taqman allelic discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case-control study involved 4,104 type 2 diabetic patients and 5,050 glucose-tolerant control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits were investigated in 17,521 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rs1535435 and rs9494266 were not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) were OR(add) 1.0 (95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>0.9-1.2; p(add)=0.7) and OR(add) 1.1 (0.9-1.2; p(add)=0.4), respectively, a finding supported by meta-analyses: OR(add) 1.0 (0.9-1.1; p(add)=0.6) and OR(add) 1.0 (0.9-1.1; p(add)=0.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither rs1535435 nor rs9494266 were consistently associated with any of the tested type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Data from large samples of Danish individuals do not support a role for AHI1 rs1535435 nor rs9494266 as major type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the importance of independent and well-powered replication studies of the recent genome-wide association scans before a locus is robustly validated as being associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
