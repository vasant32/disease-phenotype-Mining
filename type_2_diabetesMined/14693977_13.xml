<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> care in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in general practice and identify physician, organizational, and patient factors associated with suboptimal care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 895 randomly selected diabetic patients were extracted from the electronic medical records of 95 general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physician and organizational characteristics were collected with a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a multilevel analysis to identify associations with blood pressure registration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> treatment, and achievement of target blood pressure levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For 652 patients (73%), a blood pressure measurement was recorded in the last year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 132 (20%) reached a target level of 135/85 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 595 patients were classified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, of whom 192 received no treatment (32%), 193 received an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> (32%), and 210 received other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients visiting a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> facility, referred to a specialist, with a female general practitioner, or with a general practitioner with &lt;/=10 years work experience had better recordings of their blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suboptimal treatment was higher in older patients and smoking patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment was better in patients with coronary comorbidity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, or those referred to a specialist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Not achieving the blood pressure target was related to older age of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> management of type 2 diabetic patients in primary care is suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of general practitioners as well as additional care provided by a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> facility or a specialist are associated with better processes of care, but blood pressure outcomes are not as clearly related to these factors </plain></SENT>
