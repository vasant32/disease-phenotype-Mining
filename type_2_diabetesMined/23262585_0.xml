<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these physiological processes are also controlled by fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), a circulating hepatokine that improves the metabolic profile in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal experiments have suggested a possible interaction between glucagon and FGF-21 however, the metabolic consequences of this crosstalk are not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effects of exogenous glucagon on plasma FGF-21 levels and lipolysis were evaluated in healthy volunteers and humans with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as well as in rodents with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced insulinopenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the role of glucagon on FGF-21 secretion and lipolysis was studied using isolated primary rat hepatocytes and adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fgf-21 expression in differentiated rat pre-adipocytes was suppressed by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and released FGF-21 was immunoneutralised by polyclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glucagon induced lipolysis in healthy human volunteers, patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, mice and rats with STZ-induced insulinopenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and in adipocytes isolated from diabetic and non-diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, glucagon increased circulating FGF-21 in healthy humans and rodents, as well as in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and insulinopenic rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glucagon stimulated FGF-21 secretion from isolated primary hepatocytes and adipocytes derived from animals with insulinopenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, FGF-21 stimulated lipolysis in primary adipocytes isolated from non-diabetic and diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduction of Fgf-21 expression (by approximately 66%) or immunoneutralisation of released FGF-21 markedly attenuated glucagon-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that glucagon increases circulating FGF-21 independently of endogenous insulin levels </plain></SENT>
