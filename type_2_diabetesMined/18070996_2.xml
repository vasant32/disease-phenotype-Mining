<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 67 participants (5.8%) had a first CTD during 12,109 years (mean 9.4 +/- 3.7) of follow-up, an incidence of 5.5 per 1,000 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was at least 4.2 times the incidence in the general population (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazards analysis, significant independent determinants of first-ever CTD were higher BMI, taking <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medication, and being in a stable relationship (P &lt;or= 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence of first CTD is increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and sociodemographic/treatment factors that could indicate treatment-seeking behavior including CTD in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
