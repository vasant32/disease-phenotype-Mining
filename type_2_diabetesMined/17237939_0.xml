<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate this problem, we compared the tolerance and physiological responses to treadmill and cycle exercise in 31 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One group of these patients had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 12) and its members were matched for sex and age with a group of patients who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since BMI and body weight were greater in the diabetic group (28.4 +/- 3.7 vs 25.2 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2); 84.0 +/- 14.6 vs 73.8 +/- 8.0 kg), we also studied a third, 'heavy' group of non-diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> of similar age (n = 7; BMI = 30.9 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2); body weight = 85.2 +/- 8.2 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the 'light' non-diabetic group, maximum treadmill times were shorter for the diabetic and heavy non-diabetic groups (1,448 vs 845 and 915 s; ANOVA p = 0.01); maximum cycle time also tended to be shorter (ANOVA, p = 0.08) in the diabetic and heavy non-diabetic groups (median = 1,231 vs 730 and 797 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of physiological responses assessed were not different between the groups, although the time constant of oxygen uptake during submaximal treadmill and cycle exercise was significantly larger (ANOVA p &lt; 0.05) for the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate that exercise tolerance is lower in diabetic than non-diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>, but that this difference is due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> rather than <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> itself </plain></SENT>
