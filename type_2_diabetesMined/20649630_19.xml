<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To show that vildagliptin added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is non-inferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in reducing HbA1c levels from baseline over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, active-comparator study of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> inadequately controlled (HbA1c 6.5-8.5%) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (up to 6 mg/day) added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 3118 patients were randomized (vildagliptin, n = 1562; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, n = 1556) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From similar baseline values (7.3%), after 2 years adjusted mean (s.e.) change in HbA1c was comparable between vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment: -0.1% (0.0%) and -0.1% (0.0%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of non-inferiority was met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar proportion of patients reached HbA1c &lt;7% (36.9 and 38.3%, respectively), but with vildagliptin more patients reached this target without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (36.0% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial response (IR) was sustained for a mean (s.d.) of 309 (244) days with vildagliptin versus 270 (223) days for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001) (IR = nadir HbA1c where change from baseline &gt; or =0.5% or HbA1c &lt; or =6.5% within the first six months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After IR was detected, sustained response = time between nadir and an increase of &gt;0.3% above IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent of disease duration, age was a predictor of effect sustainability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> with vildagliptin (2.3% vs. 18.2% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>) with a 14-fold difference in the number of hypoglycaemic events (59 vs. 838) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin had a beneficial effect on body weight [mean (s.e.) change from baseline -0.3 (0.1) kg; between-group difference -1.5 kg; p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, both treatments were well tolerated and displayed similar safety profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin add-on has similar efficacy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> after 2 years' treatment, with markedly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> risk and no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
