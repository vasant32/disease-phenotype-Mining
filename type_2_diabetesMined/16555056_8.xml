<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of different <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapies on serum levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), TNF-alpha, leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were receiving oral hypoglycaemic agents were allocated to one of the following groups, and treated for 1 year: (1) lifestyle intervention (L); (2) insulin treatment (I); and (3) combined treatment (L+I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Similar improvements in glycaemic control occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a reduction in body weight of 3.0 kg (median) (95% CI -5.9 to -2.0) in group L, whereas in groups L+I and I body weight increased by 3.5 kg (95% CI 1.5-4.9) and 4.9 kg (95% CI -3.1 to 8.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By trend analyses, group L had reduced levels of PAI-1 (p=0.002), hs-CRP (p&lt;0.0001) and TNF-alpha (p=0.006), while no significant changes were observed in the levels of leptin or adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group I, the median levels of PAI-1 (p=0.008), TNF-alpha (p=0.058) and leptin (p=0.004) increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the L+I group there was a reduction in PAI-1 levels (p=0.014) and an increase in levels of leptin (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences in changes in the levels of PAI-1, hs-CRP, TNF-alpha and leptin between groups were also significant (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Improvement of glycaemic control through lifestyle intervention in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had more beneficial effects on adipokine levels than when the same lowering of HbA(1c) was achieved with insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
