<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of CEO alone on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in postmenopausal women, we analysed the results of the Women's Health Initiative <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>-alone trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Women's Health Initiative is a randomised, double-masked trial comparing the effect of daily 0.625 mg CEO with placebo during 7.1 years of follow-up of 10,739 postmenopausal women who were aged 50-79 years and had previously had a hysterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> incidence was ascertained by self-report of treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were measured in an 8.6% random sample of study participants, at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 8.3% in the <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>-alone group and 9.3% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.01, p=0.072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the first year of follow-up, a significant fall in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) in actively treated women compared with the control subjects (Year 1 baseline between-group difference -0.53) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> at the 3- or 6-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Postmenopausal therapy with <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> alone may reduce the incidence of treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect is smaller than that seen with <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CEO should not, however, be used with the intention of preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as its well-described adverse effects preclude long-term use for primary prevention </plain></SENT>
