<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we used a Mendelian randomisation approach to provide evidence for or against the causal role of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamin <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a common polymorphism (rs6564851) near the BCMO1 gene, which is strongly associated with circulating <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> levels (p = 2 x 10(-24)), with each G allele associated with a 0.27 standard deviation increase in levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used data from the InCHIANTI and Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) studies to estimate the association between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> levels and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We next used a triangulation approach to estimate the expected effect of rs6564851 on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and compared this with the observed effect using data from 4549 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and 5579 controls from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 0.27 standard deviation increase in <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> levels was associated with an OR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.95) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the InCHIANTI study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association was similar to that of the ULSAM study (OR 0.90 [0.84-0.97]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no association between rs6564851 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 0.98 [0.93-1.04], p = 0.58); this effect size was also smaller than that expected, given the known associations between rs6564851 and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> levels, and the associations between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> levels and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings in this Mendelian randomisation study are in keeping with randomised controlled trials suggesting that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> is not causally protective against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
