<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin (Acrp30), an adipocyte-derived protein, exists in serum as a trimer, a hexamer, and a high-molecular weight (HMW) form, including 12-18 subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because HMW adiponectin may be biologically active, we measured it in serum using a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed by gel filtration chromatography that the ELISA detected mainly adiponectin with 12-18 subunits, and we compared HMW with total adiponectin concentration in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We next investigated the relationship between serum HMW and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in 280 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients, including 59 patients with angiographically confirmed CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total adiponectin was measured in serum by a commercially available ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Like serum total adiponectin, HMW adiponectin correlated positively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and negatively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, insulin sensitivity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, and circulating inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total and HMW adiponectin were significantly higher in women than in men, as was the HMW-to-total adiponectin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum HMW and the HMW-to-total adiponectin ratio were significantly lower in men with than without CAD (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, the ratio, but neither total nor HMW adiponectin, tended to be lower when CAD was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, determination of HMW adiponectin, especially relative to total serum adiponectin, is useful for evaluating CAD in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
