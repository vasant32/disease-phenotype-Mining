<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the clinical effectiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination in adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and specifically examined potential modification of effect by age and prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccine uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was part of the Prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">Influenza</z:e>, Surveillance and Management (PRISMA) study, a nested case-control study conducted during the 1999-2000 influenza A epidemic, among 75,235 patients from primary care of any age recommended for vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 9,238 adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 131 cases arose who were either hospitalized for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> dysregulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and 61 cases who died, and we compared them with 1,561 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of (prior) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination by means of logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, health insurance coverage, prior health care use, medication use, and comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vaccination was associated with a 56% reduction in any complication (95% CI 36-70%), a 54% reduction in hospitalizations (26-71%), and 58% reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (13-80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among study subjects aged 18-64 years, we observed somewhat higher reductions in the occurrence of any complication than among those aged &gt;65 years (72 vs. 39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In first-time vaccinated subjects, the primary end point was reduced by 47% (0.2-72%), and in those who received vaccination in the year before, the reduction was 58% (4-81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, like other individuals from recognized risk groups, benefit considerably from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination, and no difference in vaccine effectiveness was observed between first-time and repeat vaccination </plain></SENT>
