<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> on insulin sensitivity and adipokine levels in hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outpatients with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (n=36; male 23, female 13), received 20-40mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> orally once daily for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical examinations and blood or urine tests were performed before and 3 or 6 months after starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were statistically compared using Wilcoxon analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment for 3 or 6 months reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, total and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, body weight, BMI and waist length were not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting IRI and HOMA-IR were significantly decreased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment, suggesting the improved insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total and high molecular adiponectin were not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, serum leptin was significantly increased by 3 months <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment, suggesting a possible involvement of leptin in improved insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with increased serum leptin level in hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
