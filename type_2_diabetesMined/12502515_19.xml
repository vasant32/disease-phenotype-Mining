<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have carried out an autosomal genome scan for genes contributing to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and affecting BMI in the Japanese population (164 families, 256 affected sib-pairs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found 12 regions that showed nominally significant multipoint evidence of linkage with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (i.e. logarithm of odds [LOD] score &gt;0.59, P &lt; 0.05): chromosome 1 29.9 cM; chromosome 2 169.6 and 236.8 cM; chromosome 4 104.9 cM; chromosome 5 114.8 cM; chromosome 6 42.3 cM; chromosome 8 15.3 and 93.3 cM; chromosome 9 140.0 cM; chromosome 11 131.6 cM; chromosome 17 36.1 cM; and chromosome 21 48.0 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve regions showed nominal multipoint evidence for linkage with log-transformed BMI (lnBMI): chromosome 2 167.9 and 210.5 cM; chromosome 3 185.7 cM; chromosome 4 118.9 and 145.6 cM; chromosome 5 131.9 cM; chromosome 7 7.4 cM; chromosome 10 70.0 cM; chromosome 15 12.8 cM; chromosome 16 30.0 cM; and chromosome 17 47.8 and 100.2 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although none of the regions achieved genome-wide levels of significance, simulation studies showed that we observed more linkage signals than expected if there were no loci contributing to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the regions showing nominal evidence for linkage with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been reported in other genome scans, and seven of the regions showing linkage with lnBMI have shown linkage with BMI and BMI-related traits in other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results may replicate findings in other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They may also indicate new regions of the genome that are involved in the regulation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels or body weight </plain></SENT>
