<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission the patient's HbA1c was 9.1% despite having taken over 60 U of human insulin per day for the previous 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high titer of antibodies to insulin was detected in the serum, and therefore, we decided to introduce insulin lispro with the aim of minimizing immunogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the next 2 months, the dosage of insulin required to achieve reasonable blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control was reduced, with the HbA1c level decreasing significantly to 6.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was subsequently withdrawn from insulin and discharged on diet therapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that insulin lispro may ameliorate resistance to insulin therapy even in the presence of human insulin antibodies </plain></SENT>
