<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether mononuclear cell production of TNF-alpha decreased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in an <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Seventeen <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (BMI 32.5+/-0.9 kg/m(2)) and 33 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, non-diabetic controls (BMI 31.2+/-0.5 kg/m(2)) underwent 12 weeks of 30% total energy restriction (6622+/-84 KJ per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Every 4 weeks, weight and blood pressure were measured and fasting venous blood was analysed for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the beginning and end of energy restriction, mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood and TNF-alpha production measured by ELSIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TNF-alpha production was not associated with the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> but was higher in diabetic subjects (P&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a reduction after energy restriction (281+/-43 to 182+/-30 pg/ml, P&lt;0.05) however the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not influence the magnitude of this change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels decreased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and weak correlations were found with TNF-alpha concentrations (r=0.3, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that maximal production of TNF-alpha from mononuclear cells decreases with energy restriction and is weakly associated with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
