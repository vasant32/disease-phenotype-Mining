<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains a difficult clinical challenge characterized by progressive insulin deficiency and frequent cardiovascular events requiring multiple therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this randomized clinical trial, we assessed the comparative effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (RSG) and insulin glargine (IG) on inflammatory biomarkers, glycemic control, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and inadequate glycemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy received 24 weeks of add-on therapy with either RSG 4mg daily or IG 10 units daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects on RSG with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values &gt;120mg/dl at 12 weeks were increased from 4 to 8mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects on IG increased insulin doses until fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was &lt;120mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Markers of glycemic control and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> including HbA1c, hsCRP, PAI-1, plasma F2-isoprostanes, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured at baseline, 12, 18, and 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RSG and IG demonstrated similar efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels by 1.5 and 1.4%, respectively, with greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> with RSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycemic events occurred with equal frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IG did not reduce hsCRP, but RSG reduced hsCRP levels 45% from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both IG and RSG reduced F2-isoprostanes similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IG did not affect PAI-1 levels, but did reduce total, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite similar HbA1c reductions with RSG and IG, differential effects were found on inflammatory biomarkers and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> that deserve consideration in the clinical decision process of selecting a therapeutic agent </plain></SENT>
