<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By this time, there are several reports that type 2 diabetic subjects have higher serum levels of hsCRP than those of non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are few reports about factors which have influence upon the level of serum hsCRP in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We had evaluated the association of serum hsCRP level with risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and five patients (59 men and 46 women) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were undergone carotid ultrasonography for evaluation of carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum hsCRP concentrations were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum hsCRP level was correlated with mean left <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r = 0.366, P = 0.003), maximal left <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r = 0.370, P = 0.002), mean right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r = 0.281, P = 0.023) and maximal right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r = 0.370, P = 0.002), body mass index (r = 0.377, P &lt; 0.001), waist circumference (r = 0.342, P &lt; 0.001), waist-hip ratio (r = 0.229, P = 0.020), serum total cholesterol (r = 0.202, P = 0.024), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (r = 0.292, P = 0.022) and serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (r = 0.133, P = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our result shows that serum hsCRP level is correlated with carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and the risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and may be useful to predict accelerated atherosclerotic process in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
