<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Various methods are used to quantify postprandial glycemia or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability, but few have been compared and none are standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to examine the relationship among common indexes of postprandial glycemia, overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability, and A1C using detailed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measures obtained during everyday life and to study which blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values of the day provide the strongest prediction of A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the A1C-Derived Average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> (ADAG) study, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were monitored in 507 participants (268 type 1 diabetic, 159 type 2 diabetic, and 80 nondiabetic subjects) with continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) and frequent self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) during 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated several indexes of glycemia and analyzed their intercorrelations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements at different times of the day (pre- and postprandial) and A1C was examined using multiple linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Indexes of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability showed strong intercorrelation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among postprandial indexes, the area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve calculated from CGM 2 h after a meal correlated well with the 90-min SMBG postprandial measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) levels were only moderately correlated with indexes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and average or postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indexes derived with SMBG strongly correlated with those from CGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some SMBG time points had a stronger association with A1C than others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, preprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values had a stronger association with A1C than postprandial values for both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types, particularly for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Indexes of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability and average and postprandial glycemia intercorrelate strongly within each category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Variability indexes are weakly correlated with the other categories, indicating that these measures convey different information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FBG is not a clear indicator of general glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Preprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values have a larger impact on A1C levels than postprandial values </plain></SENT>
