<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From a cohort of 64-year-old Caucasian women, 209 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 205 with IGT, and 186 with NGT were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alcohol consumption and medication use were assessed by questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric data were collected, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and serum adiponectin were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the NGT group, alcohol consumption was lower in the IGT group and lowest in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean alcohol intakes of &gt;9.2 and &gt; or =3-9 g/day were positively associated with adiponectin and insulin sensitivity (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]), respectively, independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, metabolic control, and other confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alcohol intake correlated negatively with inflammatory markers, although this did not remain after adjustment for HOMA and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inverse associations between alcohol consumption and factors related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> such as HOMA, waist circumference, and inflammatory markers were more obvious among women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT than in healthy women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these women, moderate alcohol consumption showed beneficial associations with the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, IGT, insulin sensitivity, and serum adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a need to clarify whether adiponectin may be a mechanistic link and also to clarify the clinical implications of these observations </plain></SENT>
