<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 31 (16 women and 15 men) type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin monotherapy, from (mean age=54 ± 3.6 years, BMI=29.7 ± 4.8 kg/m(2), T2DM treatment=9 ± 8 years, HbA1c 7 ± 1%) and not professionally active (unemployed or retired) was recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An assessment of energy cost (EC) of their weekly PA using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and an accelerometer assessment was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total energy expenditure of the declared weekly PA, calculated from the IPAQ (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>) was 2513 ± 1349 METmin/week, and 2428 ± 1348, for male and female participants, respectively (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EC of the real PA (RPA), registered with the accelerometer was 4552 ± 2028 kcal/week, and 4032 ± 2288 kcal/week, for males, and females, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who demonstrated a high <z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>, based on their IPAQ score, showed a significantly higher RPA, as registered by the accelerometer (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1c and BMI did not correlate with their PA measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the IPAQ may serve as a potential tool for physical activity assessment with no further requirement for more sophisticated methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that habitual physical activity has no impact on glycemic control and BMI in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, further studies on a larger population are needed to explore these issues </plain></SENT>
