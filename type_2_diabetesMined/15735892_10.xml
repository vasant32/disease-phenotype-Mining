<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As two reports have independently demonstrated a convincing association with variants adjacent to the HNF-4alpha P2 promoter in Finnish and Ashkenazi Jewish populations, we evaluated their contribution to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the French Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotypes for four haplotype tag SNPs were analysed for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a case-control study of 744 unrelated type 2 diabetic patients and 686 normoglycaemic subjects, and for linkage in 148 diabetic families in whom significant linkage to the HNF4alpha region had been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The association seen in the Finnish and Ashkenazi studies for SNPs rs2144908 and rs1884614 located within a haplotype block encompassing the beta cell promoter P2 of HNF-4alpha was not replicated in our study; in French Caucasians the minor allele prevalence was increased in control subjects [odds ratio (OR) 0.80, uncorrected p=0.022 for rs2144908; OR 0.82 uncorrected p=0.058 for rs1884614] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, none of the SNPs tested in the French familial sample was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, nor do they appear to contribute to the linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: None of the previously associated SNPs confer an increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in French Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large meta-analysis of association studies will determine whether there is a consistent association between particular SNPs upstream of HNF-4alpha and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in several ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
