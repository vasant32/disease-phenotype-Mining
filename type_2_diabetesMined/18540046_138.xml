<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The A1C assay, expressed as the percent of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> that is glycated, measures <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> glycemia and is widely used to judge the adequacy of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment and adjust therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Day-to-day management is guided by self-monitoring of capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to define the mathematical relationship between A1C and average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AG) levels and determine whether A1C could be expressed and reported as AG in the same units as used in self-monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 507 subjects, including 268 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 159 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 80 nondiabetic subjects from 10 international centers, was included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C levels obtained at the end of 3 months and measured in a central laboratory were compared with the AG levels during the previous 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AG was calculated by combining weighted results from at least 2 days of continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring performed four times, with seven-point daily self-monitoring of capillary (fingerstick) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> performed at least 3 days per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 2,700 glucose values were obtained by each subject during 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis between the A1C and AG values provided the tightest correlations (AG(mg/dl) = 28.7 x A1C - 46.7, R(2) = 0.84, P &lt; 0.0001), allowing calculation of an estimated average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (eAG) for A1C values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The linear regression equations did not differ significantly across subgroups based on age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type, race/ethnicity, or smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A1C levels can be expressed as eAG for most patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
