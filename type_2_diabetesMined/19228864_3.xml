<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> increases platelet reactivity and thrombin activity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> plus stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed platelet reactivity and markers of thrombin generation and activity in 193 patients from nine clinical sites of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (BARI 2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood taken at the time of enrollment was used for assay of the concentration of prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PT1.2, released when prothrombin is activated) and fibrinopeptide A (FPA, released when fibrinogen is cleaved) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation was identified with the use of flow cytometry in response to 0, 0.2, and 1 micromol/l <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concentrations of FPA, PT1.2, and platelet activation in the absence of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Greater BMI was associated with higher platelet reactivity in response to 1 microm <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> as assessed by surface expression of P-selectin (r = 0.29, P &lt; 0.0001) but not reflected by the binding of fibrinogen to activated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb-IIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI was not associated with concentrations of FPA or PT1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet reactivity correlated negatively with A1C (P &lt; 0.04), was not related to the concentration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in blood, and did not correlate with the concentration of C-reactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Among patients enrolled in this substudy of BARI 2D, a greater BMI was associated with higher platelet reactivity at the time of enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> that accompanies <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may influence platelet reactivity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
