<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three isoforms (alpha, delta, and gamma) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They act on DNA response elements as heterodimers with the nuclear <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their natural activating ligands are fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-derived substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PPAR-alpha is present in liver, heart, and, to a lesser extent, skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When activated, it promotes fatty acid oxidation, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> body synthesis, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sparing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrates, which are used as hypolipidemic drugs, are ligands of PPAR-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PPAR-delta is ubiquitous and could also favor fatty acid oxidation in tissues in which PPAR-alpha is absent or less expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PPAR-gamma is expressed in adipose tissue, lower intestine, and cells involved in immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of PPAR-gamma induces the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes and stimulates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> are compounds used as hypoglycemic, muscle insulin-sensitizing agents in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, they are activators of PPAR-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Their action on muscle insulin sensitivity may be secondary to the lowering of circulating <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> on PPAR-gamma activation and to the secretion by adipocytes of insulin-sensitizing hormones such as adiponectin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> promoting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The PPARs are thus major regulators of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, allowing adaptation to the prevailing nutritional environment </plain></SENT>
