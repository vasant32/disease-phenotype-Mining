<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the initial examination, BMI was 31.8 kg/m(2) and HbA1c 10.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her insulin secretion was sufficient (urinary CPR 80 microg/day) and the GAD antibody was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following treatment with insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, HbA1c decreased to 6.3%, though diabetic control deteriorated after 1 year (HbA1c, 11.0%) and her body weight was reduced in a short period, from 78 to 67 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Re-examination revealed that the GAD antibody was high (1870 U/mL, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> &lt;1.5) and the anti-islet cell antibody positive, and insulin secretion decreased (urinary CPR 18 microg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic cramp study using an artificial pancreas showed that the patient had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> [<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate 1.8 mg/(min kg); <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 7.4+/-2.4 (mean+/-S.D.)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An HLA-analysis showed that she was a homozygote of haplotype DRB1*0901-DQB1*0303 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of strict insulin therapy, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control was not improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> could not be used because of side effects, however, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was effective for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of case reports of patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is important for studying the relationship between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and for developing an effective treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
