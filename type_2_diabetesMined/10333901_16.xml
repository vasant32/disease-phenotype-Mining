<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence to prescribing guidelines, continuation rates, population effects on glycemic control, and occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> during the first 20 months of the availability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in a large health maintenance organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in the 90,000-member <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry of Kaiser Permanente, northern California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal study measures were the proportions of patients started on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> who met prescribing guidelines (previously on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, HbA1c, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>), the change in HbA1c at 6 months after starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and hospitalization rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 9,875 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> during this interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At least 74% were previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> alone, 81% had baseline HbA1c &gt; or = 8.5%, 71% were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and 99% had a serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &lt; or = 1.5 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> at baseline, those starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> had significantly lower HbA1c levels 6 months later than those not started, after adjustment for age, sex, and the higher baseline levels in those started (adjusted difference: 0.5%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as initial monotherapy also improved significantly, but patients previously treated with insulin (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29825">sulfonyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">ureas</z:chebi>) had slightly higher follow-up HbA1c levels than similar patients not starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> at 12 months was significantly higher for patients previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One probable case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> was identified during 4,502 person-years on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to prescribing guidelines was relatively high during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>'s first 20 months of availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control improved substantially for patients previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>Lactic acidosis</z:hpo> was rare </plain></SENT>
