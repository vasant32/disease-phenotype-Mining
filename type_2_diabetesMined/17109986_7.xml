<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Baseline patient characteristics, changes in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1c) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), other treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and hepatobiliary adverse reactions were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 24,993 patients, representing 28,008 patient-years, were included in the safety evaluation and 20,447 patients in the efficacy evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> was reported, and neither temporal nor dose relations were found between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and ALT abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum A1c was clearly reduced in patients with baseline body mass index &lt;25 kg/m(2) or baseline fasting immunoreactive insulin &lt;5.0 microU/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients treated for more than 6 months, the change in A1c was -1.0% at 6 months with both monotherapy and combination therapy and remained stable up to 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of achievement of A1c&lt;7% in patients with baseline A1c above 7% was 34.1%; notably, the achievement rate of A1c&lt;7% was approximately 30% even in patients with high baseline A1c (mean 8.8%) taking multiple <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, for whom insulin therapy is usually indicated in Japan </plain></SENT>
