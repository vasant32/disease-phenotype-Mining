<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi>, saxagliptin, vildagliptin and linagliptin, the available DPP-4 inhibitors, are oral medications, whereas the GLP-1 RAs-twice-daily exenatide, once-weekly exenatide and once-daily liraglutide-are administered subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By influencing levels of GLP-1 receptor stimulation, these medications lower plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent manner with low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, affecting postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> more than most other anti-hyperglycaemic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Use of GLP-1 RAs has been shown to result in greater glycaemic improvements than DPP-4 inhibitors, probably because of higher levels of GLP-1 receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 RAs can also produce significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and may reduce blood pressure and have beneficial effects on other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In clinical trials, liraglutide has shown efficacy and tolerability and resulted in certain significant benefits when compared with exenatide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
