<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (RSG) when added to insulin in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled on insulin monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After 8 weeks of insulin standardization and placebo (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi>) run-in, 319 type 2 diabetic patients with mean baseline HbA(1c) &gt; or = 7.5% (8.9 +/- 1.1 to 9.1 +/- 1.3) on twice-daily insulin therapy (total daily dose &gt; or = 30 U) were randomized to 26 weeks of additional treatment with RSG (4 or 8 mg daily) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin dose could be down- titrated only for safety reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was reduction of HbA(1c) from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RSG 4 and 8 mg daily significantly improved glycemic control, which was unchanged on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with RSG 8 mg plus insulin resulted in a mean reduction from baseline in HbA(1c) of 1.2% (P &lt; 0.0001), despite a 12% mean reduction of insulin dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over 50% of subjects treated daily with RSG 8 mg plus insulin had a reduction of HbA(1c) &gt; or = 1.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither total:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> nor <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratios significantly changed with RSG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events did not differ among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of RSG to insulin treatment results in significant improvement in glycemic control and is generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
