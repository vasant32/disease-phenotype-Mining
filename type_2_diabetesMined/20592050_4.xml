<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 45 trial participants and 21 health professionals and thematically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were generally psychologically insulin receptive when approached to participate in the 4-T trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their receptiveness arose largely from their personal experiences observing intensifying prior treatments and deteriorating blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control over time, which led them to engage with and accept the idea that their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Health professionals also fostered receptiveness by drawing on their clinical experience to manage patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxieties</z:hpo> about initiating insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies may have overemphasized the problem of psychological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and overlooked factors and treatment experiences that may promote insulin receptiveness among type 2 patients </plain></SENT>
