<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> evolves from normoglycemia gradually over time or as a step increase is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing in 35- to 64-year-old men and nonpregnant women from a population-based survey (Mexico City <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study) at baseline (n = 2,279) and after 3.25 (n = 1,740) and 7 years (n = 1,711) of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three occasions (nonconverters; n = 911), FPG increased only slightly (0.23 +/- 0.79 mmol/l, mean +/- SD; P &lt; 0.0001) over 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, conversion to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among NGT subjects (n = 98) was marked by a large step-up in FPG regardless of time of conversion (3.06 +/- 2.57 and 2.94 +/- 3.11 mmol/l, respectively, at 3.25 and 7 years; P &lt; 0.0001 vs. nonconverters) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in subjects who converted to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (n = 75), FPG rose by 3.14 +/- 3.83 and 3.12 +/- 3.61 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. nonconverters) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-quarters of converters had increments in FPG above the 90th percentile of the corresponding increments in nonconverters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Converters had higher baseline BMI (30.4 +/- 4.9 vs. 27.3 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2); P &lt; 0.001) and fasting plasma insulin values (120 +/- 78 vs. 84 +/- 84 pmol/l; P &lt; 0.02) than nonconverters; however, no consistent change in either parameter had occurred before conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, changes in 2-h postglucose insulin levels between time of conversion and preceding measurement were significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) related to the corresponding changes in FPG in an inverse manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, within a 3-year time frame, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is very often rapid rather than gradual and is in part explained by a fall in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin response </plain></SENT>
