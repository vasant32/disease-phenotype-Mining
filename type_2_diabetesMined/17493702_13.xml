<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) in aboriginal populations worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Medline search from 1966 to 2005 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were selected if they utilized accepted diagnostic criteria for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Year of study, sample size, response rate, age range, and prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two studies were selected, comprising 59 populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the majority demonstrated a several-fold elevation of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence as compared to non-aboriginal populations, this was not a universal finding; a small number of populations studied actually had a low prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower prevalences were found in rural compared with urban populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we were also able to document an inverse relationship between the ratio of IGT/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with the hypothesis that those populations with the very highest rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appear to have progressed past the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> stages in the natural history of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT prevalence rates vary widely amongst the world's aboriginal populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite very different histories and cultures, the consequences of rapid changes in nutrition and exercise appear to have very similar metabolic consequences on aboriginal populations, the magnitude of which may be determined by the strength of the genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
