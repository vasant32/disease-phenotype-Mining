<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still uncertain whether these changes are similar for saturated and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> and whether high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and/or insulin may change this picture </plain></SENT>
