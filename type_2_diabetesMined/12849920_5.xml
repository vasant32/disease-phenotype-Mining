<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that glutamine(Q isoform)/arginine(R isoform) polymorphism at position 192 of PON(1) gene is associated with macrovascular disease of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We re-investigated this relationship using carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) as a surrogate continuous variable for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genotype and allele frequency of PON(1) 192 Q/R polymorphism was assayed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 152 type 2 diabetic patients and 128 healthy subjects from a population of Chinese Han nationality in ChengDu area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was measured by B-mode ultrasonography in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in PON(1) gene Q/R polymorphism in the type 2 diabetic patients when compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in type 2 diabetic subjects with the QQ, QR and RR genotype was 0.65+/-0.27, 0.83+/-0.27 and 1.05+/-0.32 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-way ANOVA showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly greater in the RR subgroup than in both QR and QQ subgroups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed R allele to be the main determinant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> variability (OR 4.0 95% CI 2.10-7.40 P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data support the view that 192 R allele of PON(1) gene is a risk factor for macrovascular disease of T2DM in Chinese </plain></SENT>
