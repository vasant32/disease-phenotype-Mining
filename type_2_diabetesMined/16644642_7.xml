<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recently, we reported increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> mortality among supplemental <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> users with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> may cause <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the presence of redox active iron, we hypothesized that non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), a form of iron susceptible to redox activity, may be present in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured serum NTBI levels using high-performance liquid chromatography in 48 patients with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (at least 5 years duration since diagnosis), 49 patients with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 47 healthy control subjects (frequency matched on age and sex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NTBI was commonly present in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 59% in newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 92% in advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean NTBI values varied significantly between the three groups, with the highest values being observed in patients with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the lowest in the control subjects (0.62 +/- 0.43 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.13 micromol/l Fe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum total iron or percent transferrin saturation were very similar among the three groups, yet NTBI was strongly associated with serum total iron (r = 0.74, P &lt; 0.01) and percent transferrin saturation (r = 0.70, P &lt; 0.01) among the patients with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with our hypothesis, these data demonstrate the common existence of NTBI in type 2 diabetic patients with a strong gradient with severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective cohort studies are required to clarify the clinical relevance of increased NTBI levels </plain></SENT>
