<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 104 patients (age 56.3 ± 0.8 years, BMI 31.4 ± 0.5 kg/m(2), and A1C 9.1 ± 0.1% [mean ± SE]) were randomized to GLA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin therapy for 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of GLA, M1, and M2 were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-IR autophosphorylation was induced by purified hormones or serum by kinase receptor activation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, M1 induced comparable IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-IR autophosphorylation (activation) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 36 weeks, M1 increased from undetectable (&lt;0.2 ng/mL) to 1.5 ng/mL (0.9-2.1), while GLA and M2 remained undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GLA dose correlated with M1 (r = 0.84; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum from patients treated with GLA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin induced similar IR-A and IR-B activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that M1 rather than GLA mediates GLA effects and that compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, GLA does not increase IGF-IR signaling during long-term insulin therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
