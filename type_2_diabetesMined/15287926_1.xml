<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting blood samples were analyzed for Lp(a), total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) in 68 Pakistani patients with type 2 DM and 40 non-diabetic healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lp(a) levels were significantly raised in diabetics as compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No correlation of Lp(a) was seen with age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation of BMI to SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation between Lp(a) and total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study led us to conclude that serum Lp(a) levels are significantly raised in type 2 DM and have a positive correlation with serum total and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c levels </plain></SENT>
