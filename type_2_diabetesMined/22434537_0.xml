<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animal studies suggest that the brain is involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether insulin action in the human brain regulates peripheral insulin sensitivity and examined which brain areas are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Insulin and placebo were given intranasally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were measured in 103 participants at 0, 30 and 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup (n = 12) was also studied with functional MRI, and blood sampling at 0, 30 and 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each time-point, the HOMA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) was calculated as an inverse estimate of peripheral insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin increased</z:e> and subsequently decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This excursion was accompanied by slightly decreased plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, resulting in an initially increased HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1 h after insulin spray, the HOMA-IR subsequently decreased and remained lower up to 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase in hypothalamic activity was observed, which correlated with the increased HOMA-IR at 30 min post-spray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Activity in the putamen, right insula and orbitofrontal cortex correlated with the decreased HOMA-IR at 120 min post-spray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Central insulin action in specific brain areas, including the hypothalamus, may time-dependently regulate peripheral insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This introduces a potential novel mechanism for the regulation of peripheral insulin sensitivity and underlines the importance of cerebral insulin action for the whole organism </plain></SENT>
