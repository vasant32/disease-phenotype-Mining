<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested for associations between the -174 IL-6 G/C promoter polymorphism and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a sample of 1,428 individuals from the largest 182 families in the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Framingham Heart Study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association was found with FPG (p=0.01) and log (FPG) (p=0.005) using a modified family-based transmission disequilibrium test, the family-based association test (FBAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between IL-6 genotype and FPG (p=0.035) and log (FPG) (p=0.03) was also found in the subset of families that were informative in FBAT using a mixed-effects regression model and strengthened after adjustment for potential confounders (p=0.008 for log [FPG]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level estimated from models with log (FPG) as the dependent variable for the GG genotype in the informative families was significantly lower (5.20+/-0.06 mmol/l) than for the GC (5.41+/-0.06 mmol/l) and CC (5.38+/-0.06 mmol/l) genotypes (p=0.03 for contrast between GG and GC genotypes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the subset of informative families, the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with the GG genotype was lower relative to the GC and CC genotypes combined (potential confounder-adjusted, mixed-effects odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.88, p=0.026, unaffected n=391, affected n=32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results are consistent with a protective role for the -174 IL-6 G allele against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and warrant further analysis of this polymorphism </plain></SENT>
