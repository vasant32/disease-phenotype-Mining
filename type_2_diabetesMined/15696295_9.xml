<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have conducted an 11-year follow-up study of the Casale Monferrato cohort to assess: (1) the long-term predictive role of AER independently of conventional risk factors; (2) the shape of its relationship with cardiovascular mortality; and (3) whether fibrinogen has a predictive effect independent of the increased cardiovascular risk associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the follow-up period (1991-2001) a population-based cohort of 1,565 patients was regularly examined, and measurements of HbA1c were centralised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modelling was employed to assess the role of fibrinogen and AER as predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality, independently of baseline variables and individual cumulative average values of HbA1c during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10,890.2 person-years of observations, 685 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were identified, giving an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality rate of 63.4 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 58.8-68.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analyses, the strongest predictor of cardiovascular mortality was macroalbuminuria (relative risk 2.18, 95% CI 1.62-2.94), which was mainly associated with a high risk of short-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No increased risk was evident until the upper microalbuminuric range of AER values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinogen was also a major independent predictor, and its role was not modified by AER, or by the exclusion of subjects developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> or diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that: (1) AER is the main independent predictor of 11-year cardiovascular mortality; (2) this effect is mainly evident in the upper range of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and in macroalbuminuria; and (3) fibrinogen has an independent effect on cardiovascular mortality, but no synergistic effect with AER, suggesting that both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> are involved in the excess cardiovascular mortality of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
