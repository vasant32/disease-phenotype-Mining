<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many guidelines recommend that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should aim to reduce their intake of salt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise relationship between dietary salt intake and mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been previously explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Six hundred and thirty-eight patients attending a single <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic were followed in a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion was estimated from 24-h urinary collections (24hU(Na)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality were determined by Cox regression and competing risk modeling, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean baseline 24hU(Na) was 184 ± 73 mmol/24 h, which remained consistent throughout the follow-up (intraindividual coefficient of variation [CV] 23 ± 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a median of 9.9 years, there were 175 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 75 (43%) of which were secondary to cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality was inversely associated with 24hU(Na), after adjusting for other baseline risk factors (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For every 100 mmol rise in 24hU(Na), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was 28% lower (95% CI 6-45%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for the competing risk of noncardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and other predictors, 24hU(Na) was also significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality (sub-hazard ratio 0.65 [95% CI 0.44-0.95]; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, lower 24-h urinary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion was paradoxically associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventional studies are necessary to determine if dietary salt has a causative role in determining adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the appropriateness of guidelines advocating salt restriction in this setting </plain></SENT>
