<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used islet beta cells as well as two ex vivo models of islet amyloid formation, cultured human islets and hIAPP-expressing transgenic mouse islets with or without beta cell Fas deletion, to test whether: (1) the aggregation of endogenous hIAPP induces Fas upregulation in beta cells; and (2) deletion or blocking of Fas protects beta cells from amyloid toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: INS-1, mouse or human islet cells were cultured with hIAPP alone, or with amyloid inhibitor or Fas <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-transduced islets, and human islets or hIAPP-expressing mouse islets transduced with an adenovirus that delivers a human proIAPP-specific small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) (Ad-ProhIAPP-siRNA) were cultured to form amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse islets expressing hIAPP with or without Fas were similarly cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beta cell Fas upregulation, caspase-3 activation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and function, and islet IL-1β levels were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: hIAPP treatment induced Fas upregulation, caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in INS-1 and islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amyloid inhibitor or Fas <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>reduced apoptosis</z:mp> in hIAPP-treated beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Islet cells with Fas deletion had lower hIAPP-induced beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than those expressing Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ad-ProhIAPP-siRNA-mediated amyloid inhibition reduced Fas upregulation and IL-1β immunoreactivity in human and hIAPP-expressing mouse islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cultured hIAPP-expressing mouse islets with Fas deletion had similar amyloid levels, but lower caspase-3 activation and beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and a higher islet beta:alpha cell ratio and insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, compared with islets expressing Fas and hIAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The aggregation of biosynthetic hIAPP produced in islets induces beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, at least partially, via Fas upregulation and the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Deletion of Fas protects islet beta cells from the cytotoxic effects of endogenously secreted (and exogenously applied) hIAPP </plain></SENT>
