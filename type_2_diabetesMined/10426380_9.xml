<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When and by which mechanisms these abnormalities occur during the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 560 Pima Indians, sleeping metabolic rate (respiratory chamber) was higher not only in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (+4.9%, P &lt; 0.001) but also in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) (+2.7%, P &lt; 0.01) compared with subjects with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longitudinally, RMR (ventilated hood) increased progressively in 17 subjects in whom <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance deteriorated from NGT to IGT (+4.2%) to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (+2.6%) over 5.1 +/- 1.4 years (P &lt; 0.05 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In parallel, IIT (% increase in metabolic rate during an insulin/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion) decreased during the transition from NGT (11.7%) to IGT (7.3%) to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (6.5%) (P &lt; 0.05 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 151 subjects, basal endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output (3-3H-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), fasting insulin and free fatty acid concentrations, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (hyperinsulinemic clamp) were significant determinants of RMR, independent of body composition, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonoxidative and oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, RMR, and fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were determinants of IIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in RMR and IIT between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance groups decreased after adjusting for these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that increases in RMR and decreases in IIT occur early in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and that both changes are related to the progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> that occur during the development of the disease </plain></SENT>
