<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the IGF-I system in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) without previously known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients were classified before hospital discharge by means of an OGTT as having NGT, IGT or newly detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-matched subjects from the background population (n=185) served as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations between fasting levels of IGF-I and IGF binding proteins 1 and 3 (IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism during a follow-up period of 12 months were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At hospital discharge, age-adjusted IGF-I (IGF-I SD) was significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>=IGT or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) compared with patients with NGT (p=0.014) and control subjects (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IGF-I was strongly correlated with IGFBP-3 (r=0.730, p&lt;0.001), which was significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> compared with patients with NGT (p=0.009) and control subjects (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting levels of IGFBP-1 did not differ significantly between patients with NGT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> or between patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multiple logistic regression analysis in patients, IGF-I at hospital discharge was a significant predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> at discharge and after 12 months (adjusted odds ratio 0.29, p=0.022, and adjusted odds ratio 0.29, p=0.034, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low levels of IGF-I may be a useful predictor of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
