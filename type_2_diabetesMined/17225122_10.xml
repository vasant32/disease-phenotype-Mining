<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinical information system in Tayside (population 387,908), Scotland, to identify new cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 1993 and 2004 and to calculate incidence rates and mid-year prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined mortality rates as the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of diabetic people divided by mid-year prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used logistic and Poisson regression to analyse trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then modelled the increase in prevalence for each year for three scenarios, based on whether mortality or incidence rates remained unchanged from 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a doubling in incidence and prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Tayside over the 12 years, with statistically significant increasing trends of 6.3 and 6.7% per year respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If incidence and mortality had remained at 1993 levels, there would have been an increase in prevalence of 855 per 100,000 in 2003, accounting for 60.1% of the actual increase of 1,423 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If there had been no mortality decrease, prevalence in 2003 would have been very similar to the actual prevalence observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Decreasing mortality rates in Tayside had less effect on the increase in prevalence than did increasing incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even if incidence and mortality remain unchanged, prevalence will increase by over 20% in the next decade </plain></SENT>
