<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In recent years, there has been an ongoing discussion on the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and driving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As driving performance will inevitably decline at lower levels of glycemia, patients' decisions concerning driving or taking corrective action when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurs immediately before or during driving seems paramount </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four type 1 diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (T1Norm group), 21 type 1 diabetic patients with impaired awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (T1Imp group), and 20 type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (T2 group) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were asked whether they felt hypoglycemic and whether they would currently drive during experimental euglycemia (5.0 mmol/l) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (2.7 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the T1Norm group, 1 patient (4.2%) decided to drive during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the T1Imp group, 9 patients (42.9%) said they would drive in the hypoglycemic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the T2 group, 5 patients (25%) would drive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was more frequently the case for patients on oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (chi2 = 4.44; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No effect of sex (chi2 = 0.78; P = 0.38) or age (chi2 = 0.22; P = 0.64) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> frequently decided to drive while hypoglycemic, whereas patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> appeared to make safe decisions concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and driving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> awareness frequently made potentially dangerous decisions as well, particularly when using oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, early, clear, and consistent education is imperative </plain></SENT>
