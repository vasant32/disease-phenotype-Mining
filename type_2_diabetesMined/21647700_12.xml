<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Using 1.8 million directly interrogated and imputed genotypes in 837 unrelated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 436 normoglycaemic controls, we conducted Armitage trend tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To improve power in this population with high disease rates, we also performed ordinal regression including an intermediate class with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These analyses were followed by meta-analysis with a study of 967 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 343 normoglycaemic controls from Mexico City, Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The top signals (unadjusted p value &lt;1 × 10(-5)) included 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight gene regions (PER3, PARD3B, EPHA4, TOMM7, PTPRD, HNT [also known as RREB1], LOC729993 and IL34) and six intergenic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these was a missense polymorphism (rs10462020; Gly639Val) in the clock gene PER3, a system recently implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also report a second signal (minimum p value 1.52 × 10(-6)) within PTPRD, independent of the previously implicated SNP, in a population of Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Top meta-analysis signals included known regions HNF1A and KCNQ1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Annotation of top association signals in both studies revealed a marked excess of trans-acting eQTL in both adipose and muscle tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In the largest study of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican populations to date, we identified modest associations of novel and previously reported SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, in our top signals we report significant excess of SNPs that predict transcript levels in muscle and adipose tissues </plain></SENT>
