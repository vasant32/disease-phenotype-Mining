<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate the effects of the isoform-selective PKC-beta inhibitor ruboxistaurin mesylate on neurovascular function and other measures of DPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Endothelium-dependent and C fiber-mediated SkBF, sensory symptoms, neurological deficits, nerve fiber morphometry, quantitative sensory and autonomic function testing, nerve conduction studies, quality of life (using the Norfolk Quality-of-Life Questionnaire for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diabetic Neuropathy</z:e> [QOL-DN]), and adverse events were evaluated for 20 placebo- and 20 ruboxistaurin-treated (32 mg/day) DPN patients (aged &gt; or =18 years; with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and A1C &lt; or =11%) during a randomized, double-masked, single-site, 6-month study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelium-dependent (+78.2%, P &lt; 0.03) and C fiber-mediated (+56.4%, P &lt; 0.03) SkBF at the distal calf increased from baseline to end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements from baseline within the ruboxistaurin group were also observed for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> Total Symptom Score-6 (NTSS-6) (3 months -48.3%, P = 0.01; end point -66.0%, P &lt; 0.0006) and the Norfolk QOL-DN symptom subscore and total score (end point -41.2%, P = 0.01, and -41.0, P = 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between-group differences in baseline-to-end point change were observed for NTSS-6 total score (placebo -13.1%; ruboxistaurin -66.0%, P &lt; 0.03) and the Norfolk QOL-DN symptom subscore (placebo -4.0%; ruboxistaurin -41.2%, P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant ruboxistaurin effects were demonstrated for the remaining efficacy measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were consistent with those observed in previous ruboxistaurin studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of DPN patients, ruboxistaurin enhanced SkBF at the distal calf, reduced sensory symptoms (NTSS-6), improved measures of Norfolk QOL-DN, and was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
