<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific secretory protein found in circulation in several different forms and is present at significantly lower levels in the plasma of diabetic patients compared with that of insulin-sensitive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to test whether insulin per se is a contributing factor toward lower plasma adiponectin concentrations and, if so, whether the splanchnic bed contributes to this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We sampled femoral artery and hepatic venous samples and measured the high-molecular weight (HMW) and low-molecular weight (LMW) fractions of adiponectin in 11 type 2 diabetic and 7 nondiabetic subjects matched for age, sex, and BMI during basal conditions and during a hyperglycemic (approximately 9.5 mmol/l) hyperinsulinemic (approximately 700 pmol/l) clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under these conditions, total arterial adiponectin, HMW, and the ratio of HMW to total adiponectin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were lower (P &lt; 0.01) in the diabetic versus nondiabetic subjects, whereas the LMW form did not significantly differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under hyperinsulinemic conditions, total adiponectin levels dropped, primarily due to a reduction of the HMW form, whereas LMW forms were not significantly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HMW adiponectin and the ratio of HMW to total adiponectin are lower in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that HMW adiponectin is downregulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
