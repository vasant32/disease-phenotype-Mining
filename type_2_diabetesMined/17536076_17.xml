<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to define the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a low-risk Caucasian population in northern Spain and its association with various risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Asturias Study is a prospective, population-based survey of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The baseline examination was carried out during 1998-1999 when 1,034 individuals, aged 30-75 years, were randomly selected to determine the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Principality of Asturias (northern Spain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2004-2005, these same subjects were invited for a follow-up examination; 700 participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study includes only those individuals who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the World Health Organization 1999 criteria to classify <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism at both baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> adjusted for the age and sex structure of Asturias was 10.8 cases/1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.1-14.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates were 5 cases/1,000 person-years in individuals with normoglycemia, 21 cases/1,000 person-years in individuals with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), 34.7 cases/1,000 person-years in individuals with isolated impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), and 95.2 cases/1,000 person-years in individuals with combined IFG-IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed that, together with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, which were the strongest predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and BMI were also independently associated with progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-year prospective population-based study, we found an incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 10.8 cases/1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both FPG and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were strongly predictive of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and their effect was additive </plain></SENT>
