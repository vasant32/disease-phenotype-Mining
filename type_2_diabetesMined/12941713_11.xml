<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether measures of physical activity are related to an insulin sensitivity index ([ISI] 10(4)/fasting insulin x <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) independent of weight or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of 90 Pima Indian children (39 boys and 51 girls) at 5 and 10 years of age measuring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), physical activity behavior (questionnaire: number of activities per week [ACT], average hours per week [TIME]), and energy expenditure (doubly labeled water: physical activity level [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses, ACT was correlated with ISI at 5 years of age (r = 0.24, P = 0.02) and at 10 years of age (r = 0.21, P = 0.05), but these relationships were not independent of weight or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> was correlated with ISI at 10 years of age (r = 0.39, P = 0.03) but was not independent of weight or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Longitudinally, ISI decreased from 5 to 10 years of age, and increases in weight and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> were associated with decreases in ISI (r = -0.51 and -0.41, respectively; both P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ACT decreased from 5 to 10 years of age, but children who had smaller decreases in ACT had smaller decreases in ISI, independent of increases in weight or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (partial r = 0.22, P = 0.04 adjusted for either weight or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that early establishment and maintenance of an active lifestyle can have a beneficial effect on ISI that is partially independent of changes in weight or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is particularly relevant considering the current epidemics of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children </plain></SENT>
