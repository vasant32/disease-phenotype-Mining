<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 16-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study, 639 patients with inadequate glycaemic control on at least half-maximal dose of sulphonylurea were randomly assigned to: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> 10 mg b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(n = 164); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 500 mg (n = 153); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 2.5 mg/500 mg (n = 160); or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 5 mg/500 mg (n = 162) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Titration was allowed to maximum doses of 2000 mg for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or 10 mg/2000 mg and 20 mg/2000 mg for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 2.5 mg/500 mg and 5 mg/500 mg respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was HbA1c level after 16 weeks; secondary end-points included fasting and 2-h post-prandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) were recorded and summarized by treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both strengths of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> equally reduced mean HbA1c by 1.7% more than did <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> alone (p &lt; 0.001), and by 1.9% more than did <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were also lower in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (-2.8 mmol/l, -51.3 mg/dl; p &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups (-3.6 mmol/l, -64.2 mg/dl; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability were similar across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups, except for a higher incidence of gastrointestinal AEs in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy group, and more patients reporting mild or moderate symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> while taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> tablet strengths produced, with equal efficacy, significantly better glycaemic control than monotherapy with either agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data also confirm that glycaemic efficacy does not require maximal sulphonylurea doses in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
