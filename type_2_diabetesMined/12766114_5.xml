<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and management of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Characteristics of nephropaths identified by existing screening practice (phase I, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> &gt;20 mg/l in three separate urine samples), were compared with those identified by a nurse-led management program (phase II, in which screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was based on albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio in a single random urine specimen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In phase I, 644 patients attended a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic over a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> results were available for 485 patients (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 115 patients were identified as nephropaths (prevalence 17.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 91% had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During phase II, prospective analysis of urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio was carried out in 880 patients over 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 174 patients were identified as nephropaths (prevalence 20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 134 patients had been identified by existing screening protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty had no previous record of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and were therefore newly identified by prospective screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure guidelines were met in only 31% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known nephropaths and 26.5% of newly diagnosed nephropaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diastolic blood pressure guidelines were met in 36% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known and 38% of newly diagnosed nephropaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the patient group of known nephropaths from phases I and II, 62% were prescribed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> (ACEIs) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor (AIIR) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the newly identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> patient cohort from phase II, 48% used ACEIs or AIIR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of a nurse-led management program significantly improved detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We are currently evaluating its impact on clinical management </plain></SENT>
