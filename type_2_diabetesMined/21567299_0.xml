<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In light of this, we examined the involvement of a pro-apoptotic gene, BBC3 (also known as PUMA), in TNF-α-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and destruction in human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human islets were exposed in vitro to TNF-α alone or in combination with IFN-γ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR using a set of single islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein abundance and cellular localisation of BBC3 were assessed by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A marginal number of islets were transplanted into diabetic NODscid mice to correlate in vivo islet function with BBC3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BBC3 and IL8 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were upregulated in TNF-α-stimulated islets in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced through addition of IFN-γ, but not upregulated by IFN-γ alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that TNF-α in combination with IFN-γ upregulated basal BBC3 abundance in the cytoplasm of beta cells along with the perinuclear clustering of mitochondria partially co-localised with BBC3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNF-α alone did not induce beta cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but did abrogate preproinsulin precursor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> synthesis in response to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation, which was inversely associated with upregulation of BBC3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by TNF-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher BBC3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in islets correlated with decreased graft function in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that BBC3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can serve as a molecular marker to detect early TNF-α-induced beta cell stress and may help identify islet-protective compounds for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
