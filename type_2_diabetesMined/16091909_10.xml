<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the role played by total adiponectin and by the bioactive high-molecular-weight (HMW) oligomeric complexes of adiponectin in vascular function in offspring whose parents both had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a population at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Total and %HMW adiponectin, the cytokines C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), as well as <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were assayed in 19 offspring, each with two type 2 diabetic parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent OGTTs and IVGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) was assessed by brachial artery ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between %HMW and total adiponectin levels (r=0.72, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite an expected strong positive correlation between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and adiponectin levels (r=0.52, p=0.04), as well as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and EDV (r=0.56, p&lt;0.02), there was no significant relationship between either total adiponectin or % HMW adiponectin and EDV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was inversely associated with PAI-1 (r=0.50, p=0.05), but did not correlate with the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In offspring of diabetic parents, a population at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and atherosclerotic disease, there is no relationship between total or %HMW adiponectin and endothelium-dependent vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, low adiponectin was associated with impaired fibrinolysis as manifested by increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 </plain></SENT>
