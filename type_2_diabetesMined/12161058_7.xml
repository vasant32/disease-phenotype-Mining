<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies suggest a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility locus on human chromosome 20, near the melanocortin receptor-3 (MC3-R) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the MC3-R as a candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 12 members of a large Maori kindred with multiple affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coding region of the MC3-R gene was sequenced for both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two separate single base pair substitutions were found in the MC3-R coding sequence and these resulted in amino acid changes, Lysine6Threonine and Isoleucine81Valine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither of these MC3-R variants tracked with the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the variant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> MC3-R showed similar functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A polymorphic marker (D20S32e) close to the human MC3-R (hMC3-R) coding sequence was investigated in a 60-member pedigree for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an association between D20S32e genotype and fasting insulin (P=0.0085) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index, HOMA-R (P=0.0042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association was also found between genotype and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing (P=0.0037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of BMI, age, gender and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support a role for variations in the coding region of the hMC3-R in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this Maori kindred, but suggest that a locus on chromosome 20 q, close to D20S32e, may contribute to both insulin secretion and action in the Maori kindred </plain></SENT>
