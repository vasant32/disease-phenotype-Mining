<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The screening survey for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was conducted in 1994, and a follow-up study of 627 high-risk non-diabetic individuals at baseline was carried out in 1999 in Beijing area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 70 men and 76 women developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the 5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking, systolic blood pressure, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication, occupation, education, urine albumin excretion rate, and fasting insulin, the odds ratios for incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 1.00, 2.04 (95% CI 0.84-4.97), 7.82 (2.66-23.00), 9.38 (3.30-26.69) in men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, isolated IFG, isolated IGT, and both IFG and IGT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In women, the corresponding odds ratios were 1.00, 2.19 (0.91-5.30), 1.62 (0.72-3.67), and 8.79 (2.98-25.93), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that combined IFG and IGT at baseline is a strong risk predictor for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolated IGT is also a predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese men </plain></SENT>
