<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, mean HbA(1c) was significantly lower among CHW participants, compared with usual care, after adjusting for confounders (b = -0.53; SE = 0.21; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The odds of making a clinically significant improvement in HbA(1c) of at least 0.5% in the CHW group was twice the odds in the usual care group after controlling for confounders (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in blood pressure, weight, or waist circumference at 12 months between groups.CONCLUSIONSA culturally adapted nurse-CHW team intervention was able to significantly improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control in the U.S </plain></SENT>
