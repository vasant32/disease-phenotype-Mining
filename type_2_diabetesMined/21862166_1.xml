<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or sulphonylureas without insulin therapy were compared for the relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> outcomes, adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics likely to affect risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients were likely to be younger, female, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was associated with higher levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sulphonylurea-treated patients had a longer history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and microvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sulphonylurea treatment was associated with higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and lower plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> and sulphonylureas did not significantly influence the benefits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> outcomes </plain></SENT>
