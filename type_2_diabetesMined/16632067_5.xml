<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But most Japanese and Chinese MODY patients are not linked to known MODY genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the genetic and clinical characteristics of Korean subjects with MODY and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had been diagnosed before 15 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 23 unrelated subjects fulfilling the criteria for MODY (three consecutive generations of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with at least one member diagnosed under the age of 25 year) and 17 unrelated subjects diagnosed with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 DM under the age of 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HNF-4alpha (MODY1), glucokinase (MODY2) and HNF-1alpha (MODY3) genes were analysed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene were found in two patients (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these, P393fsdelC, was novel, and was found in a patient classified in the MODY group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GCK gene mutation, R191W, was identified in one patient classified as early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 DM (2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in the HNF-4alpha gene, except the T130I variant, which is a known rare polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene and GCK account for a small proportion, about 5% and 2.5%, respectively, in Korean MODY and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of MODY cases in the Korean population are due to defects in unknown genes </plain></SENT>
