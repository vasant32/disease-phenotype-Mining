<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The vascular actions of insulin may contribute to the increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that when capillary recruitment by insulin is blocked in vivo, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another agent that may have vascular effects is the inflammatory cytokine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which has been reported to play an important role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in both animals and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the present study, we have investigated the effect of an intravenous 3-h TNF treatment (0.5 microg x h(1) x kg(-1)) in control and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic-clamped (10 mU x min(-1) x kg(-1) for 2 h) anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hind-leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, muscle uptake of 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> (2-DG), femoral blood flow (FBF), vascular resistance (VR), and capillary recruitment as measured by metabolism of infused 1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25348">methylxanthine</z:chebi> (1-MX) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin alone caused a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in FBF (1.7-fold) and capillary recruitment (2.5-fold), with a significant decrease in VR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, hind-leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was increased (fourfold), as was 2-DG uptake in the soleus and plantaris muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNF completely prevented the insulin-mediated changes in FBF, VR, and capillary recruitment and significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) the insulin-mediated increase in total hind-leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (by 61%) and muscle 2-DG uptake (by at least 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNF alone had no significant effect on any of these variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration in vivo of TNF completely blocks the hemodynamic actions of insulin on rat skeletal muscle vasculature and blocks approximately half of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether these two effects are interdependent </plain></SENT>
