<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein (CRP) has been shown to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but whether CRP has a causal role is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association of baseline serum CRP and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during follow-up was investigated, and a meta-analysis was conducted on the BMI-adjusted relation of CRP and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the association of CRP haplotypes with serum CRP and risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.41 (95% CI 1.29-1.54) per 1 SD increase in natural logarithm of CRP, and it was 1.88, 2.16, and 2.83 for the second, third, and fourth quartiles of CRP, respectively, compared with the first quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk estimates attenuated but remained statistically significant after additional adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> indexes, which agreed with the results of the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common genetic haplotype was associated with a significantly lower CRP level compared with the three other haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher in the haplotype with the highest serum CRP level compared with the most common haplotype (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.08-1.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that serum CRP enhances the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
