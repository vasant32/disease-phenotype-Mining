<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this project was to compare changes in BMD during 3 years of ALN treatment versus placebo in diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the Fracture Intervention Trial, a randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial conducted at 11 centers in which 6458 women aged 54-81 years with a femoral neck BMD of &lt;or=0.68 g/cm(2) were randomly assigned to either placebo or 5 mg/day ALN for 2 years, followed by 10 mg/day for the remainder of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 297) was defined by self-report, use of insulin or other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, or a random nonfasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value &gt;or=200 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In diabetic women, 3 years of ALN treatment was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000062'>increased BMD</z:mp> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites studied, including 6.6% at the lumbar spine and 2.4% at the hip, whereas women in the placebo group experienced a decrease in BMD at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites except the lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The safety/tolerability of ALN was similar to placebo, except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, which was more likely in the ALN group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ALN <z:mp ids='MP_0000062'>increased BMD</z:mp> relative to placebo in older women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and was generally well tolerated as a treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases in BMD with ALN therapy compared with placebo were similar between women with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
