<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cytokine levels were measured in 19 healthy control subjects and 129 offspring of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (109 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance [NGT] and 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was determined with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, insulin secretion with the intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, and abdominal fat distribution with computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines were elevated in nondiabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-1beta was increased in the NGT group and decreased in the IGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, levels of IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1Ra) were increased in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta and -Ra levels correlated inversely (P &lt; 0.05) with rates of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and IL-1beta positively with visceral fat mass (P &lt; 0.05) in normoglycemic offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nondiabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects have changes in the levels of inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of IL-1Ra seems to be the most sensitive marker of cytokine response in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> state </plain></SENT>
