<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor TCF7L2 is an essential factor for glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) secretion from intestinal L cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied whether a defect in the enteroinsular axis contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in carriers of TCF7L2 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 1,110 non-diabetic German participants for five single nucleotide polymorphisms in TCF7L2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent an OGTT; GLP-1 secretion was measured in 155 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 210 participants, an IVGTT combined with a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another 160 participants from the Netherlands and 73 from Germany, a hyperglycaemic clamp (10 mmol/l) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 73 German participants this clamp was combined with a GLP-1 infusion and an arginine bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The OGTT data confirmed that variants in TCF7L2 are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, insulin secretion induced by an i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge in the IVGTT and hyperglycaemic clamp was not different between the genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 concentrations during the OGTT were not influenced by the TCF7L2 variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, GLP-1-infusion combined with a hyperglycaemic clamp showed a significant reduction in GLP-1-induced insulin secretion in carriers of the risk allele in two variants (rs7903146, rs12255372, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Variants of TCF7L2 specifically impair GLP-1-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This seems to be rather the result of a functional defect in the GLP-1 signalling in beta cells than a reduction in GLP-1 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This defect might explain the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in carriers of the risk alleles and confers the increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
