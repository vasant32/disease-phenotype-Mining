<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> Study were studied to better characterise who is at risk of an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level and to determine whether those with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> elevation have a differential risk of adverse renal or cardiovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi>-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> increase (FACI) was defined as an increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> of at least 20% from baseline to month 4 in participants assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline patient characteristics, and baseline and 4-month drug, clinical, laboratory characteristics and study outcomes were examined by FACI status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the sample, 48% of those randomised to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> had at least a 20% increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> within 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, participants who were older, male, used an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> at baseline, used a thiazolidinedione (TZD) at 4 months post-randomisation, had baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and had lower baseline serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> more likely to meet the criteria for FACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants in the FACI group were also more likely to have a decrease in their serum triacylglycerol level from baseline to 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in study outcomes were seen by FACI criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Several characteristics predict a rapid rise in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> upon starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants who met the criteria for FACI also had a greater change in triacylglycerol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the setting of careful renal function surveillance and reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> dose as indicated, no increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> or cardiovascular outcome was seen in those individuals demonstrating FACI </plain></SENT>
