<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) is an intestinal insulinotropic hormone that augments <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induced insulin secretion, and has a trophic effect on beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of GLP-1 on insulin secretion after islet transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent hyperglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp studies 1 month after their last transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 was infused during the second hour of the hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who underwent an identical hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First phase insulin release was absent in patients, while second phase insulin was not significantly reduced (control: 118+/-29 pM; type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 68+/-20 pM; transplant: 99+/-18 pM, p=ns for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 had a significant incretin effect on transplanted islets but the response was less than controls (control: 2108+/-344 pM; type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 929+/-331 pM; transplant: 329+/-112 pM, p&lt;0.0001 control versus transplant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Islet transplant patients had no evidence of resistance to insulin mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that transplanted islets retain the ability to respond to GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
