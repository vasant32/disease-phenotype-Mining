<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic patients, the relationships between oesophageal emptying, gastric emptying, gastrointestinal symptoms, autonomic nerve function and glycaemic control were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of the solid meal remaining in the stomach at 100 min (p less than 0.001), the 50% gastric emptying time for the liquid meal (p less than 0.05) and oesophageal emptying (p less than 0.05) were slower in the diabetic patients compared to the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scores for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> and autonomic nerve dysfunction did not correlate significantly (p greater than 0.05) with oesophageal, or gastric emptying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 50% gastric emptying time for the liquid meal was positively related (r = 0.58, p less than 0.01) to the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration at the time of the performance of the gastric emptying test and the lag period, before any solid food emptied from the stomach, was longer (p less than 0.05) in subjects with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations during the gastric emptying measurement greater than the median, compared to those with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations below the median </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that delayed gastric and oesophageal emptying occur frequently in Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and that <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> relates, at least in part, to plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
