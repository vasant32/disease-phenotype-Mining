<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previously performed genome-wide scan of Japanese type 2 diabetic sibpairs, we observed linkage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to chromosome 20q12-q13, a region in which the HNF4A gene is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have reported associations between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and polymorphisms in the P2 promoter region specific to beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we attempted to assess whether the HNF4A gene plays a role in the genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population by analyzing polymorphisms and haplotypes of the HNF4A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium across the P2 promoter region was preserved in the Japanese population, consistent with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although none of the individual polymorphisms examined showed any significant association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we found very strong evidence of the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the haplotype consisting of two polymorphisms in the P2 promoter region of the HNF4A gene (P = 3.82 x 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and haplotypes consisting of polymorphisms not located in the P2 promoter region, suggesting that the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility loci are localized in the P2 promoter region of the HNF4A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association was replicated using two additional cohorts (P = 1.51 x 10(-4) and 0.019, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the present analysis revealed that the HNF4A gene might be a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene common to different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study also suggested the possible existence of an as-yet-unidentified but functional polymorphism in the P2 promoter region of the HNF4A gene that directly influences susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
