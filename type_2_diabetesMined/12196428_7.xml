<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The partners of 75 Latino and 113 European-American patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed for level of depressive affect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and for three groups of potential stressors: demographics (age, gender, and education), patient disease status (time since diagnosis, HbA(1c), comorbidities, and BMI), and family stress (disease impact, spouse conflict, and family closeness) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dependent variables were partner depressive affect (Center for Epidemiological Studies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (Symptom Checklist [SCL-90] <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictors of partner depressive affect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and partner-patient concordance rates were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of depressive affect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and rates of likely <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (21.4%) were as high for partners as they were for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were found on depressive affect or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> by ethnicity, but female partners scored higher than male partners on both measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partner-patient concordance rates were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The family level variables accounted for the most variance in both depressive affect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, with demographics and disease status variables contributing modest or nonsignificant independent variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Partners of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> experience levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> as high or even higher than patients, especially if the partner is female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low levels of concordance suggest that partners can be distressed even if patients are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">life stresses</z:e> contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> among partners, not just disease-related indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest the utility of evaluating both partners and patients using a life-centered rather than a disease-focused perspective </plain></SENT>
