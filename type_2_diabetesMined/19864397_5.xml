<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the significance of GAD antibodies (GADAs) and family history for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FH(T1)) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FH(T2)) in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: GADAs were analyzed in 4,976 nondiabetic relatives of type 2 diabetic patients or control subjects from Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 289 (5.9%) were GADA(+)-a total of 253 GADA(+) and 2,511 GADA(-) subjects participated in repeated oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests during a median time of 8.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed using Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects within the highest quartile of GADA(+) (GADA(+)(high)) had more often first-degree FH(T1) (29.2 vs. 7.9%, P &lt; 0.00001) and GADA(+) type 2 diabetic (21.3 vs. 13.7%, P = 0.002) or nondiabetic (26.4 vs. 13.3%, P = 0.010) relatives than GADA(-) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, the GADA(+) subjects developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> significantly more often than the GADA(-) subjects (36/253 [14.2%] vs. 134/2,511 [5.3%], P &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GADA(+)(high) conferred a 4.9-fold increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (95% CI 2.8-8.5) compared with GADA(-)-seroconversion to positive during the follow-up was associated with 6.5-fold (2.8-15.2) and first-degree FH(T1) with 2.2-fold (1.2-4.1) risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only three subjects developed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and others had a non-insulin-dependent phenotype 1 year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GADA(+) and GADA(-) subjects did not clinically differ at baseline, but they were leaner and less insulin resistant after the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GADA positivity clusters in families with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GADA positivity predicts <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and this risk was further increased with high GADA concentrations </plain></SENT>
