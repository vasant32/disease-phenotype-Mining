<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the risk of MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> being fatal in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be estimated using information available around the time <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analyses were based on 674 cases of MI (351 fatal) that occurred in 597 of 5,102 U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) patients for whom covariate data were available during a median follow-up of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine differences in risk factors, measured within 2 years of diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, between fatal and nonfatal MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar analyses were performed for 234 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (48 fatal) that occurred in 199 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with fatal MI had higher HbA(1c) than those with nonfatal MI (odds ratio 1.17 per 1% HbA(1c), P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had higher HbA(1c) than those with nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.37 per 1% HbA(1c), P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors for MI case fatality included increased age, blood pressure, and urine albumin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> being fatal in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with risk factors, including HbA(1c), measured many years before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Equations have been added to the UKPDS Risk Engine to estimate likely case fatality rates in MI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
