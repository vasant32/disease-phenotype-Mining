<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the general population, a low ankle-brachial index (ABI) (&lt;0.9) is strongly associated with (cardiovascular) mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association between the ABI and mortality may be weaker in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as ankle pressures may be elevated by medial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> and arterial stiffening, which occur more frequently in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the association between ABI and mortality in individuals without and with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the associations between ABI and cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in 624 individuals from the Hoorn study, a population-based cohort of 50- to 75-year-old individuals (155 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 469 without) followed for a median period of 17.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 289 of 624 (46.3%) participants died (97 of 155 with and 192 of 469 without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 52 of 65 with and 237 of 559 without ABI &lt;0.9): 85 (29.4%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (30 of 155 with and 55 of 469 without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20 of 65 with and 65 of 559 without ABI &lt;0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A low ABI was strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality (relative risk 2.57 [95% CI 1.50-4.40]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (2.02 [1.47-2.76]), after adjustment for Framingham risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associations of the ABI with mortality did not differ between individuals without and with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for cardiovascular (P(interaction) = 0.45) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause (P(interaction) = 0.63) mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the Hoorn Study, associations between ABI and cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were similar in individuals without and with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies should investigate, in both individuals without and with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whether measurement of ABI can be used to guide treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
