<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomly assigned 66 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (BMI: 27-40 kg/m2) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to either a low-protein (15% protein, 55% carbohydrate) or high-protein diet (30% protein, 40% carbohydrate) for 8 weeks of energy restriction (approximately 6.7 MJ/day) and 4 weeks of energy balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were asked to maintain the same dietary pattern for a further 12 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study was completed by 38 of the subjects, with equal dropouts in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At Week 64, weight reductions against baseline were -2.2+/-1.1 kg (low protein) and -3.7+/-1.0 kg (high protein), p&lt;0.01, with no diet effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fat mass was not different from baseline in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At Week 12, both diets reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 6 and 3 mm Hg respectively, but blood pressure increased more with weight regain during follow-up in the low-protein group (p&lt; or =0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At Week 64, both diets significantly increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and lowered C-reactive protein concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the urinary <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> : <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio at baseline between the two groups, but this ratio increased at Week 12 (in the high-protein group only, p&lt;0.001, diet effect), remaining stable during follow-up in both diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A high-protein weight-reduction diet may in the long term have a more favourable cardiovascular risk profile than a low-protein diet with similar weight reduction in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
