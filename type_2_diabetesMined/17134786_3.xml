<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighteen insulin-treated <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients were followed for 18 months after they followed a 30-day very low calorie diet (VLCD, 450kCal/day) with the cessation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the 30-day VLCD, caloric intake was slowly increased to eucaloric and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication was restarted if necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On day 0 and 30 of the VLCD and after 18 months follow-up, bodyweight, blood-pressure, glycaemic control and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 30-day VLCD significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced bodyweight</z:mp> (-11.7+/-0.7kg, mean+/-S.E.M.) and improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and glycaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a group, this effect was sustained at 18 months follow-up despite the fact that patients used less <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-, blood-pressure- and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially, the use of insulin was significantly reduced: 18 out of 18 patients on day 0 (mean 137+/-22units/day); 5 out of 18 patients at 18 months (86+/-14units/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients using insulin at 18 months had regained weight to prediet levels, but still had a better cardiovascular risk profile compared with before the dietary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, a once-only 30-day VLCD leads to a sustained improvement in glycaemia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and blood-pressure up to 18 months follow-up in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients, even, although to a lesser extent, in patients who regained body-weight </plain></SENT>
