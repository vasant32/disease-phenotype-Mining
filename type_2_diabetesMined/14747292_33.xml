<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reducing glucagon receptor expression may thus ameliorate the consequences of hyperglucagonemia and improve blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study describes the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effects of a specific glucagon receptor antisense oligonucleotide (GR-ASO) in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of GR-ASOs to inhibit glucagon receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was demonstrated in primary mouse hepatocytes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal administration of GR-ASO at a dosage of 25 mg/kg twice a week in db/db mice for 3 weeks resulted in 1) decreased glucagon receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in liver; 2) decreased glucagon-stimulated cAMP production in hepatocytes isolated from GR-ASO-treated db/db mice; 3) significantly reduced blood levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and free fatty acids; 4) <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp>; and 5) a diminished hyperglycemic response to glucagon challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither lean nor db/db mice treated with GR-ASO exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suppression of GR expression was also associated with increased ( approximately 10-fold) levels of plasma glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in pancreatic islet cytoarchitecture, islet size, or alpha-cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, alpha-cell glucagon levels were increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our studies support the concept that antagonism of glucagon receptors could be an effective approach for controlling blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
