<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the initiation phase of the DURABLE trial, patients were randomized to a twice-daily lispro mix 75/25 (LM75/25; 75% lispro protamine suspension, 25% lispro) (n = 1,045) or daily glargine (GL) (n = 1,046) with continuation of prestudy oral antihyperglycemic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline A1C was similar (LM75/25: 9.1 +/- 1.3%; GL: 9.0 +/- 1.2%; P = 0.414) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 weeks, LM75/25 patients had lower A1C than GL patients (7.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 7.3 +/- 1.1%, P = 0.005), greater A1C reduction (-1.8 +/- 1.3 vs. -1.7 +/- 1.3%, P = 0.005), and higher percentage reaching A1C target &lt;7.0% (47.5 vs. 40.3%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LM75/25 was associated with higher insulin dose (0.47 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.40 +/- 0.23 units x kg(-1) x day(-1), P &lt; 0.001) and more <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (3.6 +/- 4.0 vs. 2.5 +/- 4.0 kg, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LM75/25 patients had a higher overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rate than GL patients (28.0 +/- 41.6 vs. 23.1 +/- 40.7 episodes x pt(-1) x year(-1), P = 0.007) but lower nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rate (8.9 +/- 19.3 vs. 11.4 +/- 25.3 episodes x pt(-1) x year(-1), P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates were low in both groups (LM75/25: 0.10 +/- 1.6 vs. GL: 0.03 +/- 0.3 episodes x pt(-1) x year(-1), P = 0.167) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with GL, LM75/25 resulted in slightly lower A1C at 24 weeks and a moderately higher percentage reaching A1C target &lt;7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving LM75/25 experienced more <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and higher rates of overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> but lower rates of nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Durability of regimens will be evaluated in the following 2-year maintenance phase </plain></SENT>
