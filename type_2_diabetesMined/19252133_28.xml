<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies have resulted in a dramatic increase in our knowledge of the genetic loci involved in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a complementary approach to these single-marker studies, we attempted to identify biological pathways associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This approach could allow us to identify additional risk loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used individual level genotype data generated from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> study, consisting of 393,143 autosomal SNPs, genotyped across 1,924 case subjects and 2,938 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought additional evidence from summary level data available from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Genetics Initiative (DGI) and the Finland-United States Investigation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> Genetics (FUSION) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of pathways was performed using a modification of the Gene Set Enrichment Algorithm (GSEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 439 pathways were analyzed from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology, and BioCarta databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After correcting for the number of pathways tested, we found no strong evidence for any pathway showing association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (top P(adj) = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The candidate WNT-signaling pathway ranked top (nominal P = 0.0007, excluding TCF7L2; P = 0.002), containing a number of promising single gene associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These include CCND2 (rs11833537; P = 0.003), SMAD3 (rs7178347; P = 0.0006), and PRICKLE1 (rs1796390; P = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expressed in the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Common variants involved in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk are likely to occur in or near genes in multiple pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pathway-based approaches to genome-wide association data may be more successful for some complex traits than others, depending on the nature of the underlying disease <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
