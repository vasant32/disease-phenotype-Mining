<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Entry into the trial followed 2 months of dietary treatment for newly diagnosed patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty symptoms with five levels of severity were included in the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A complaint rate was computed as the sum of symptom scores divided by the number of symptom questions answered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complaint rate was independently and positively related to BMI, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), and being a woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three symptoms--presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>dry mouth</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001), thirst (P &lt; 0.01), and stomach pain (P = 0.02)--were related to FPG independent of sex, age, BMI, or blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>dry mouth</z:hpo> was related to HbA1c (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complaints of <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp>, swollen ankles, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, heartburn, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo>, wheezing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000017'>nocturia</z:hpo>, thirst, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> increased with BMI independently of other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A complaint of cold extremities decreased with BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Heartburn, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of limbs, and hot flushes were positively related to blood pressure, and unsteadiness was negatively related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms reported by patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased with FPG and markedly with BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The symptoms associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> have been underestimated in the past </plain></SENT>
