<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We studied the associations of size at birth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin sensitivity and beta cell function in the Danish population-based Inter99 study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00289237) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Information about size at birth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> was identified from original midwife records in 4,744 middle-aged Danes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and beta cell function (disposition index) were assessed using a 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants born prematurely were compared with a group of at-term participants born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in birthweight of 1 kg was associated with a 51% (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35-0.69) reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ponderal index, reflecting thinness at birth, was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to the same extent as birthweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was increased to a similar degree in participants born prematurely and participants born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo>, although the former had a higher ponderal index at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, birthweight z-scores, reflecting fetal growth rate, were unrelated to the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to other measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation in participants born prematurely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> was inversely associated with insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> was associated solely with decreased insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: While the association between birthweight and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is mediated via combined effects on beta cell function and insulin sensitivity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> seems to influence risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> via attenuated insulin sensitivity only and independently of fetal growth rates </plain></SENT>
