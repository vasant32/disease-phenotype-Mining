<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 40 T2DM patients (27 men, 13 women; mean age 49.63 years), and 10 non-diabetic controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men; mean age 38.60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> was measured as DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a key transcription factor in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of NF-kappaB subunit p65, and NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha were assessed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcript levels for p65, IkappaBalpha, and the NF-kappaB target genes TNF-alpha, MMP-9, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 were measured by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) and glycohemoglobin were measured for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, p65 and IkappaBalpha protein levels, and expression of IL-6, TNFalpha and MMP-9 were significantly higher in PBMCs from T2DM patients, than from non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB binding was significantly positively associated with both BMI and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> was observed in PBMCs in T2DM patients in a Chinese population, and correlated independently with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lack of correlation with glycohemoglobin suggested that moderate-term blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control did not mitigate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
