<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration &gt;4 weeks comparing short-acting insulin analogues (lispro, aspart or glulisine) with HRI in type 2 diabetic patients were retrieved; data on HbA1c and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> et end-point and incidence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were extracted and meta-analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 13 RCTs (7, 4 and 2 with lispro, aspart and glulisine, respectively) were retrieved and included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short-acting analogues reduced HbA1c by 0.4% (0.1-0.6%) (p = 0.027) in comparison with HRI </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In type 2 diabetic patients, short-acting insulin analogues provide a better control of HbA1c and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than regular human insulin, without any significant reduction of the risk of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
