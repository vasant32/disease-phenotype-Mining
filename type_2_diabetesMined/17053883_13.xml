<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Ideally, a therapeutic insulin secretagogue should coordinately increase insulin production and insulin secretion to maintain islet beta cell secretory capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the incretin mimetic exendin 4 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (known as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> in the USA and Canada) for their effects in upholding a balance between (pro)insulin biosynthesis and insulin secretion in pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated rat islets were incubated for 1 or 16 h over a range of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (2.8-16.7 mmol/l) with or without exendin 4 (10 nmol/l) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (1 micromol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Islets were then analysed for preproinsulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by RNase protection and quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin biosynthesis was analysed by metabolic pulse-radiolabelling, immunoprecipitation and PAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion and insulin content were analysed by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither exendin 4 nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> affected islet preproinsulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, exendin 4 significantly increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced proinsulin biosynthesis at the translational level within 1 h, in marked contrast to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, which inhibited proinsulin biosynthesis, especially at basal and intermediate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exendin 4 potentiated insulin secretion in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent manner, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> stimulated insulin secretion independently of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exendin 4 better maintained rat islet insulin content compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, which depleted intracellular stores of insulin in islet beta cells by 40% within 16 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Exendin 4 maintains insulin stores and beta cell secretory capacity primarily by translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis in parallel to insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi> does not regulate insulin production in coordination with stimulated insulin secretion, and consequently depletes islet insulin stores, compromising secretory capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, at the level of the beta cell, incretin mimetics have an advantage over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> for treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
