<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that maximal whole-body <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation during exercise (FATmax) is reduced and that training-induced metabolic adaptation is attenuated in T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> T2D (n = 12) and control (n = 11) subjects matched for age, sex, physical activity and body mass index completed 10 weeks of aerobic training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were investigated before and after training with maximal and submaximal exercise tests and euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps combined with muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Training increased maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)) and muscle <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase activity and decreased blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations during submaximal exercise in both groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FATmax increased markedly (40-50%) in both T2D and control subjects after training (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in these variables and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> threshold (%VO(2max)) between groups before or after training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance rate (Rd) was lower in T2D vs. control subjects both before and after training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rd increased in response to training in both groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between Rd and measures of oxidative capacity or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation during exercise or the training-induced changes in these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FATmax was not reduced in T2D, and muscle oxidative capacity increased adequately in response to aerobic training in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with and without T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These metabolic adaptations to training seem to be unrelated to changes in insulin sensitivity and indicate that an impaired capacity for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation is not a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in T2D </plain></SENT>
