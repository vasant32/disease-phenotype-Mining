<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The worldwide prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is increasing at an alarming rate, along with the associated increased rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While efforts to address environmental factors responsible for the recent epidemic must continue, investigation into the anorectic functions of potential molecules we present here, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)E, offers exciting possibilities for future development of successful anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Changes in feeding behavior after intracerebroventricular injection of apoE, the regulation of hypothalamic apoE gene expression by energy status, and the interaction of hypothalamic apoE with other neuropeptides were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracerebroventricular apoE significantly decreased food intake without causing malaise, whereas intracerebroventricular infusion of apoE antiserum stimulated feeding, implying that endogenous apoE tonically inhibits food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, apoE was present in the hypothalamus, a brain site intimately involved in the integration of signals for energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasted rats exhibited significantly decreased apoE gene expression in the hypothalamus, and refeeding of these rats for 4 h evoked a significant increase of hypothalamic apoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both genetically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (ob/ob) mice and rats with high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> had significantly reduced hypothalamic apoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels compared with their lean control counterparts, suggesting that decreased apoE may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> in these <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, apoE-stimulated hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin gene expression and SHU9119, a melanocortin 3/4 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, attenuated the inhibitory function of apoE on feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that apoE suppresses food intake via a mechanism enhancing melanocortin signaling in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
