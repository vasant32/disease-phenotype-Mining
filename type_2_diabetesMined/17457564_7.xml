<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are usually regarded as distinct disorders, but the convergence of their phenotypes over recent years, the relationship of body weight to the risk of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the diminishing importance of the type 1 susceptibility genes and the finding of autoantibodies in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, invite a different interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility that type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, rather than being different, are merely poles of a single spectrum, where variation in the tempo of beta cell loss determines age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and symptoms at presentation, has important implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correct classification is crucial because it directs appropriate treatment and, where available, prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article argues that type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is currently misclassified, provides evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> drives type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as it does type 2, and proposes how the 'accelerator hypothesis' can be tested in a randomised controlled trial, which could demonstrate, for the first time, the safe and effective prevention of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
