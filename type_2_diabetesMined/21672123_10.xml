<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin increases urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion by selective inhibition of renal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in patients with uncontrolled T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, international, multicentre trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00680745) enrolled patients with uncontrolled T2DM [<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) 7-10%] receiving sulphonylurea monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult patients (n = 597) were randomly assigned to placebo or dapagliflozin (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/day) added to open-label <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 4 mg/day for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was HbA1c mean change from baseline at 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included change in body weight and other glycaemic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 24 weeks, HbA1c adjusted mean changes from baseline for placebo versus dapagliflozin 2.5/5/10 mg groups were -0.13 versus -0.58, -0.63, -0.82%, respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.0001 vs. placebo by Dunnett's procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Corresponding body weight and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were -0.72, -1.18, -1.56, -2.26 kg and -0.11, -0.93, -1.18, -1.58 mmol/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In placebo versus dapagliflozin groups, serious adverse events were 4.8 versus 6.0-7.1%; hypoglycaemic events 4.8 versus 7.1-7.9%; events suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infection</z:e> 0.7 versus 3.9-6.6%; and events suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> 6.2 versus 3.9-6.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney infections</z:e> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in patients with T2DM uncontrolled on sulphonylurea monotherapy significantly improved HbA1c, <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced weight</z:mp> and was generally well tolerated, although events suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> were reported more often in patients receiving dapagliflozin </plain></SENT>
