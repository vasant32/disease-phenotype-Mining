<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A trend toward an excess of combined cardiovascular events in the intensive treatment arm of this trial was reported earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present analysis was done to evaluate the effect of 2 years of intensive glycemic control on the left ventricular (LV) function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patients were randomized to intensive step treatment with insulin alone or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (intensive treatment arm [INT], n = 75) or to standard once-daily insulin injection (standard treatment arm [STD], n = 78) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 136 patients (standard treatment arm [STD], n = 70; INT, n = 66) had radionuclide ventriculography at entry and at 24 months for the assessment of LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in the mean LV ejection fraction (at entry: STD 57.1+/-9.51%; INT 58.1+/-8.7%; at 24 months: STD 57.3+/-10.8%, INT 59.5+/-10.7%), peak filling rate (at entry: STD 2.6+/-0.7 end diastolic volume per second, INT 2.4+/-0.8 end diastolic volume per second; at 24 months: STD 2.7+/-1.0 end diastolic volume per second, INT 2.5+/-0.7 end diastolic volume per second), or time to peak filling rate (at entry: STD 195.3+/-69.5 ms, INT 185.6 +/-62.4 ms; at 24 months: STD 182.6+/-64.8 ms, INT 179.2+/-61.2 ms) between the 2 treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis of 104 patients (STD, n = 53; INT, n = 51) that omitted individuals with intervening cardiac events/revascularization or a change in cardioactive medications also showed no difference in the LV function at entry and at 24 months between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003921'>Abnormal LV</z:mp> ejection fraction at baseline predicted cardiac events (interval between cardiac beats [RR] = 2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two years of intensive glycemic control does not affect the LV systolic or diastolic function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
