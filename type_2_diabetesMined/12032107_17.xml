<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> (AN) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and the association of AN with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> compared with other known or suspected risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young American Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A random sample of Cherokee Nation members aged 5-40 years was invited to participate in the Cherokee <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, a cross-sectional study of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its risk factors in a young American Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected by personal interview, medical history, physical examination (including anthropometric and blood pressure measurements and examination of the neck for AN), and laboratory analyses of blood specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of insulin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were measured on fasting blood specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status was determined according to the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2,205 participants were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall prevalence rates for AN and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> were 34.2 and 47.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, the rates for both increased with age and degree of Indian heritage and were higher in female subjects, overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and those with a parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, both had significantly higher age- and sex-adjusted means for selected known or suspected risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AN remained significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.0001) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AN is independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and therefore may be useful as an early indicator of high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
