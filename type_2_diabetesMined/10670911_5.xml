<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well established that serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> (TSA) is elevated in patients with type-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp>) compared to non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether serum TSA is also elevated in type-1 diabetic patients (<z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>IDDM</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one type-1 patients were studied along with age and sex matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> non-diabetic subjects (ten males and 11 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their ages were 24.8+/-3.4 years (20-30) and 23.5+/-3.9 years (18-30) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was 12.6+/-6.7 years (1-24) with a HBA1c of 9.0+/-2.2% (6.0-14.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in serum TSA of the type-1 diabetic patients 689+/-107 mg/l versus 670+/-119 mg/l in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nor was there a significant correlation between serum TSA with patient age (r = -0.31), urine albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) (r = 0.25), HBA1c (r = 0.36), plasma random <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r = -0.04) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (r = -0.09) in the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant correlation between serum TSA and mean daily insulin dose (r = 0.51, P&lt;0.02) and also serum cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (r = 0.58, P&lt;0.01 and r = 0.49, P&lt;0.04, respectively) in the type-1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, we conclude that serum TSA is not elevated in young type-1 diabetic patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age and sex matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between serum TSA and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and also mean daily insulin dose merits further research </plain></SENT>
