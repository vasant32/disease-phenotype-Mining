<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be partially explained by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> characterized by high plasma triacylglycerol (TAG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, and a predominance of atherogenic small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDLs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fish oil reduces plasma TAG and has previously been shown to improve the distribution of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> subclasses in healthy subjects and might, therefore, be a good nonpharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigate the effect of fish oil supplementation on the fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, including <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 42 type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to supplementation (capsules) with 4 g daily of either fish oil (n = 20) or corn oil (n = 22) for 8 weeks preceded by a 4-week run-in period of corn oil supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was drawn before and after the 8-week intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subclasses, were separated by ultracentrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fish oil lowered TAG (group difference: P = 0.025) and raised <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-2b cholesterol (P = 0.012) and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-2a cholesterol (P = 0.007) concentrations as compared with corn oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed no significant effects of fish oil on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, or the concentration of small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil supplementation may partially correct the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the putative very important aspect of diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>-the predominance of small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles-was unaffected by fish oil </plain></SENT>
