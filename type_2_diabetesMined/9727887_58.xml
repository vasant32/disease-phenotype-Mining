<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a sample of 2,118 adults, age &gt; or =18 years, with self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 22 states that participated in the 1994 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most subjects were age &gt; or =45 years (83%), women (51%), and white (75%) and were diagnosed at ages &gt; or =30 years (83%), had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (89%), and were not using insulin (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 78% practiced self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and 25% were aware of the term "glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>" or "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A one C" (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the last year, 72% of the subjects visited a health care provider for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care at least once, 61% had their feet inspected at least once, and 61% received a dilated eye examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controlled for age and sex, the odds ratios (ORs) for insulin use were for self-monitoring (OR [95% CI]; 4.0 [2.6-6.1]); having heard of HbA1c or receipt of a dilated eye examination (1.9 [1.4-2.5]); at least one visit to a provider (3.4 [1.9-7.2]); and feet inspected at least once (2.1 [1.5-2.9]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, people &lt;45 years, those who did not complete high school, and those without insurance coverage were high-risk groups for underuse of preventive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 3% of insulin users and 1% of nonusers met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five of the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association standards in the previous year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Underuse of recommended preventive care practices is common among people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
