<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Exendin-4 is a 39 amino acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> isolated from the salivary secretions of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It shows 53% sequence similarity to glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike GLP-1, exendin-4 has a prolonged <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering action in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the potency and duration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects of exendin-4 and GLP-1 in hyperglycemic db/db and ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas reductions in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of up to 35% vanished within 1 h with most doses of GLP-1, the same doses of exendin-4 resulted in a similar <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect that persisted for &gt;4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exendin-4 was 5,530-fold more potent than GLP-1 in db/db mice (effective doses, 50% [ED50s] of 0.059 microg/kg +/-0.15 log and 329 microg/kg+/-0.22 log, respectively) and was 5,480-fold more potent in ob/ob mice (ED50s of 0.136 microg/kg+/-0.10 log and 744 microg/kg+/-0.21 log, respectively) when the percentage fall in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 1 h was used as the indicator response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exendin-4 dose-dependently accelerated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering in diabetic rhesus monkeys by up to 37% with an ED50 of 0.25 microg/kg +/-0.09 log </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two experiments in which diabetic fatty <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats were injected subcutaneously twice daily for 5-6 weeks with doses of exendin-4 up to 100 microg x rat(-1) x day(-1) (approximately 250 microg/kg), HbA1c was reduced relative to saline-injected control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exendin-4 treatment was also associated in each of these experiments with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improved insulin sensitivity, as demonstrated by increases of up to 32 and 49%, respectively, in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR) in the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ED50s for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and the increase in clamp GIR were 1.0 microg/kg+/-0.15 log and 2.4 microg/kg+/-0.41 log, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of exendin-4 has demonstrated an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect in several animal models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
