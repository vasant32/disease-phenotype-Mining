<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether a short-term dietary intervention with purified insoluble fibres influences <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and delayed responses of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen healthy women with NGT were studied for 300 min on six to eight occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects consumed three matched portions of control (C) or fibre-enriched bread (10.4-10.6 g/portion; wheat fibre [WF], oat fibre [OF], and, in a substudy [n=9], resistant <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> [RS]) followed by control (C-C, C-WF, C-OF, C-RS) on subsequent days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fibre enrichment accelerated the early insulin response (fibrextime interaction p=0.026 for WF, p&lt;0.001 for OF, p=0.126 for RS; time of maximal concentration [T(max)], C 57.9+/-5.9, WF 49.3+/-2.5 [p=0.086], OF 46.1+/-2.9 [p=0.026], RS 46.7+/-5.8 min [p=0.029]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also associated with an earlier postprandial GIP response after OF (T(max), C 83.6+/-7.2, WF 70.7+/-6.0 [p=0.054], OF 64.3+/-6.9 [p=0.022], RS 60.0+/-5.0 [p&gt;0.15]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased fibre intake for 24 h was further associated with a reduced postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response on the following day subsequent to ingestion of a control meal (AUC(C-C) 4,140+/-401, AUC(C-WF) 2,850+/-331 [p=0.007], AUC(C-OF) 2,830+/-277 [p=0.011]), with no difference in maximal concentration and T(max) of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in insulin responses were observed 24 h after the fibre-enriched diets compared with control (p&gt;0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonic fermentation was increased only on study days C-OF (p=0.017) and C-RS (p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The consumption of highly purified insoluble dietary fibres accelerated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GIP and insulin response and was further associated with enhanced postprandial carbohydrate handling the following day upon ingestion of a control meal </plain></SENT>
