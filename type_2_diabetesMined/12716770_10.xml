<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene for insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) represents a strong positional and biological candidate for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IDE maps to chromosome 10q23.3, a region linked to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in several populations; the rat homolog has been directly implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility; and known functions of IDE support an important role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought evidence for association between IDE variation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by mutation screening, defining local haplotype structure, and genotyping variants delineating common haplotypic diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An initial case-control analysis (628 diabetic probands from multiplex sibships and 604 control subjects) found no haplotypic associations, although one variant (IDE2, -179T--&gt;C) showed modest association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR]1.25, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage partitioning analyses failed to support this association, but provided borderline evidence for a different variant (IDE10, IVS20-405A--&gt;G) (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither variant was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when replication was sought in 377 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> diabetic subjects and 825 control subjects, though combined analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> typed cohorts indicated a nominally significant effect at IDE2 (OR 1.21 [1.04-1.40], P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of convincing support for this association from linkage partitioning or analyses of continuous measures of glycemia, we conclude that analysis of over 2,400 samples provides no compelling evidence that variation in IDE contributes to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in humans </plain></SENT>
