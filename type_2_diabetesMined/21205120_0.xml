<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials have shown an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> in patients treated with TZDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of TZDs in clinical practice has the potential to increase morbidity and health care costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> in TZD and non-TZD-treated patients in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seen in the South Central US Veterans Administration health care network between 1 October 1996 and 31 December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We constructed a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the impact of TZD therapy on time to incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 3956 patients, 29% (n = 1157) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> was higher in patients who received TZD medications than in those who received TZDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for multiple cardiac risk factors, the hazard ratio for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> for TZD versus non-TZD-treated patients was 0.69 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.60-0.79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients in this cohort who received TZD medications had a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> than patients who did not receive TZDs </plain></SENT>
