<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an inpatient crossover study, 40 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to receive 9 days of inhaled insulin three times daily before meals or 9 days of glargine administered in the morning before breakfast in a randomized order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the last 72 h in each phase, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was measured with continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was measured by determining the 15(S)-8-iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(2alpha)-secretion in 24-h urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inhaled insulin improved overall and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control significantly better than insulin glargine (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards a greater reduction in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability (8-9%) in the inhaled group [p = 0.1430 and p = 0.3298 for mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGEs) and mean of daily differences respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp>, estimated by determining the urinary isoprostane excretion (15(S)-8-iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(2alpha)), was equally reduced from baseline by both treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a mealtime insulin approach to improve glycaemic control more than a basal insulin approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate also that lowering <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> using insulin treatment lowers <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> over time, at least for the study period of 9 days, in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Contrary to earlier data, we found no correlation between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability (MAGE) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (15(S)-8-iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(2alpha)) in this study </plain></SENT>
