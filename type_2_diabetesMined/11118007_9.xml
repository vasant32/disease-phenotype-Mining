<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by impaired beta-cell function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and islet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary constituent of islet amyloid is the 37-amino acid beta-cell product called islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP) or amylin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study mechanisms of islet amyloid formation, we developed a transgenic mouse model that produces and secretes the amyloidogenic human IAPP (hIAPP) molecule and have shown that 81% of male transgenic mice develop islet amyloid after 14 months on a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test whether impaired beta-cell function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> could enhance islet amyloid formation, we cross-bred our hIAPP transgenic mice with beta-cell glucokinase-knockout mice (GKKO) that have impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-mediated insulin secretion and fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting new (hIAPPxGKKO) line of mice had higher basal plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations than the hIAPP transgenic mice at 3, 6, and 12 months of age (P &lt; 0.05), as did GKKO mice compared with hIAPP transgenic mice at 6 and 12 months of age (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels were lower in hIAPP x GKKO mice than in hIAPP transgenic mice at 6 months of age (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve in response to an intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge (1 g/kg body weight) was larger in hIAPPxGKKO mice than in hIAPP transgenic mice at 3, 6, and 12 months of age (P &lt; 0.005) and in GKKO mice compared with hIAPP transgenic mice at 6 and 12 months of age (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the IRI curve was lower in hIAPPxGKKO mice at 6 and 12 months of age (P &lt; 0.05) than in hIAPP transgenic mice and in GKKO mice compared with hIAPP transgenic mice at 12 months of age (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, hIAPPxGKKO mice had a lower incidence (4 of 17 vs. 12 of 19, P &lt; 0.05) and amount (0.40 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.3 arbitrary units, P &lt; 0.05) of islet amyloid than hIAPP transgenic mice had </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As expected, no islet amyloid was observed in GKKO mice lacking the hIAPP transgene (0 of 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in pancreatic content of IRI and hIAPP among the three groups of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite the presence of impaired islet function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, hIAPPxGKKO mice had a decreased incidence and quantity of islet amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our data suggest that impaired beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> are not likely to contribute to islet amyloid formation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this finding may explain the lack of progression of glycemia in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
