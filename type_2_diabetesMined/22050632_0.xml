<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of laparoscopic gastric banding and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in a cohort of 39 T2DM Chinese patients with body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their mean body weights and BMI before surgery were 108 kg and 40 kg/m(2) , respectively, and 18 patients (46%) had suboptimal diabetic control (HbA1c &gt;7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 27 months, 4 of 11 insulin-dependent patients (36%) were able to stop their insulin therapy, and 18 patients (46%) achieved remission of T2DM (HbA1c &lt;6.5% without the use of medication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control remained poor in only nine other patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that a short history of T2DM and high BMI could predict remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after restrictive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that restrictive surgery can significantly improve glycaemic control in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
