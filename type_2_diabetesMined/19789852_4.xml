<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the potential role of PED in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the effect of PED overproduction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> on kidney function in animal and cellular models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transgenic mice overexpressing PED (PEDTg) featured age-dependent increases of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels and urinary volume, accompanied by expansion of the mesangial area, compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum and kidney levels of TGF-beta1 were also higher in 6- and 9-month-old PEDTg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of PED in human kidney 2 cells significantly increased TGF-beta1 levels, SMAD family members (SMAD)2/3 phosphorylation and fibronectin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Opposite results were obtained following genetic silencing of PED in human kidney 2 cells by antisense oligonucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of phospholipase D and protein kinase C-beta by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35687">2-butanol</z:chebi> and LY373196 respectively reduced TGF-beta1, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and fibronectin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, inhibition of TGF-beta1 receptor activity and SMAD2/3 production by SB431542 and antisense oligonucleotides respectively reduced fibronectin secretion by about 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta1 circulating levels were significantly reduced in Ped knockout mice and positively correlated with PED content in peripheral blood leucocytes of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data indicate that PED regulates fibronectin production via phospholipase D/protein kinase C-beta and TGF-beta1/SMAD pathways in kidney cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Raised PED levels may therefore contribute to the abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
