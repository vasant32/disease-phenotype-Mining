<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Association studies were conducted by genotyping 932 Europid and African American diabetic and control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Family studies were conducted in 673 members of 68 Europid families ascertained for at least two diabetic siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic studies were conducted in 585 non-diabetic individuals who had undergone frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests to determine insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression studies were conducted in 74 adipose samples and 64 muscle samples from non-diabetic individuals with known genotypes and also in 55 lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCF7L2 variants were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Europid case-control population and in families, but not in African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk alleles increased the 60 min post-challenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value in Europid families and reduced insulin sensitivity by 45% in Europids, but did not alter insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCF7L2 expression was not altered by genotype and did not correlate with insulin sensitivity or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed TCF7L2 as a risk factor in a population of European descent, where it <z:mp ids='MP_0005293'>reduced glucose tolerance</z:mp> and insulin sensitivity, but not insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no role in African Americans and could not explain the association by altered adipocyte or muscle gene expression </plain></SENT>
