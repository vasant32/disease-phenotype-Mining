<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-intensity interval training (HIT) is a time-efficient method to induce physiological adaptations similar to END, but little is known regarding the effect of HIT in T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM), we examined the 24-h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response to one session of HIT consisting of 10 × 60 s cycling efforts at ~90% maximal heart rate, interspersed with 60 s rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven adults with T2D underwent CGM for 24-h on two occasions under standard dietary conditions: following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HIT and on a non-exercise control day (CTL) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the potential for HIT to improve glycaemic control in T2D </plain></SENT>
