<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 166 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (4 mg/day) for 12 weeks without changing any of their previous medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)45 and SNP276 of ACDC were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regarding SNP45, there was a smaller reduction in the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) level and the HbA(1c) value in the carriers of the GG genotype than in the carriers of the other genotypes (P = 0.031 and 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a smaller increase in the serum adiponectin concentration for the GG genotype than for the other genotypes (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding SNP276, there was less reduction in the FPG level for the GG genotype than for the other genotypes (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the haplotype analysis, the reductions in the FPG and HbA(1c) levels were smaller for the GG homozygote haplotype than for the other haplotypes (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in the plasma adiponectin concentration for the GG homozygote haplotype was smaller than that of the other haplotypes (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that genetic variations in the adiponectin gene can affect the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment response of the circulating adiponectin level and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
