<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the magnitude of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with TZDs and classify this adverse effect under the novel dose-time-susceptibility system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Evidence from randomized trials, controlled observational studies, anecdotal case reports, case series, and spontaneous reports in the Canadian Drug Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP) was analyzed in a teleo-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A random-effects meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials showed an odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 (95% CI 1.08-4.08; P = 0.03) for the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in patients randomized to TZDs compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four observational studies revealed an OR of 1.55 (1.33-1.80; P &lt; 0.00001) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with TZDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dose-time-susceptibility analysis of 28 published reports and 214 spontaneous reports from the CADRMP database showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was more likely to occur after several months (with median treatment duration of 24 weeks after initiation of therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> equally occurred at high and low doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adverse reaction was not limited to the elderly, with 42 of 162 (26%) of the reported cases occurring in patients aged &lt;60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our teleo-analysis confirms the increased magnitude of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with TZDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We estimate the number needed to harm with TZDs to be approximately 50 over 2.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Existing guidelines and package inserts may have to be revised to incorporate these risk characteristics of TZDs </plain></SENT>
