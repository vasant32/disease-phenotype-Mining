<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 388 individuals (22% male, age 46 + 11 years) at risk for T2DM were randomized to Standard (n = 182) or Intervention (n = 206) care and evaluated at baseline and 5 annual follow-up visits, including blood pressure, BMI, A1C, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, urine albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, VO2max, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Standard group received results of annual lab tests and quarterly newsletters, while the Intervention group received quarterly newsletters and detailed discussions of lab results, routine self-directed activities, semi-annual group meetings and monthly telephone calls for ongoing support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 359 (93%) returned for at least one follow-up visit and 272 (70%) completed the final 5-year assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Return rates, changes in measures and incidence of IGT/T2DM were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) was the most prevalent baseline abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A1C and BMI were significant predictors of IGT/T2DM after controlling for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of IGT/T2DM within 5 years was 17.16 (95% CL: 6.169, 47.736) times greater for those with baseline A1C&gt;=5.8% as compared to those &lt;5.8% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Baseline A1C&gt;=5.8% was a significant predictor of IGT/T2DM within 5 years in a population at high risk for T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A1C is routinely performed among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, however these data and other evidence suggest that it may also be a useful tool for risk assessment and screening </plain></SENT>
