<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate whether there would be any association between abnormalities of either reg1 alpha or reg1 beta gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in man, these two genes were analyzed in 42 patients with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 12 with fibrocalculous pancreatopathy, 37 with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, by PCR-SSCP analysis and nucleotide sequencing technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism in the reg1 alpha gene resulted in three mobility patterns in the PCR-SSCP analysis, due to nucleotide constituents at position -10 before exon 1 being either C/C, T/C or T/T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These three mobility patterns were observed in every group of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of reg1 beta gene showed nucleotide substitutions in exon 4 in one patient, exon 5 in another patient with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and in exon 4 and intron 5 in one patient with fibrocalculous pancreatopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide substitutions in exon 4 in the patient with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that with fibrocalculous pancreatopathy occurred at codons 103 and 84 while that in exon 5 in the patient with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred at codon 141, changing the codons from CAT to CAC, GTG to GCG, and ACT to AAT and resulting in H103H silent, V84A and T141N missense mutations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, using PCR-SSCP and nucleotide sequence analyses, we did not find any association between abnormalities of either reg1 alpha or reg1 beta gene with any type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> studied </plain></SENT>
