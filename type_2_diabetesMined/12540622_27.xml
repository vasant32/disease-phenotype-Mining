<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine and formally compare the ability of simple indexes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) to predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we used combined prospective data from the San Antonio Heart Study, the Mexico City <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study, which include well-characterized cohorts of non-Hispanic white, African-American, Hispanic American, and Mexican subjects with 5-8 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Poisson regression was used to assess the ability of each candidate index to predict incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the follow-up examination (343 of 3,574 subjects developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The areas under the receiver operator characteristic (AROC) curves for each index were calculated and statistically compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In pooled analysis, Gutt et al.'s insulin sensitivity index at 0 and 120 min (ISI(0,120)) displayed the largest AROC (78.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This index was significantly more predictive (P &lt; 0.0001) than a large group of indexes (including those by Belfiore, Avignon, Katz, and Stumvoll) that had AROC curves between 66 and 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings were essentially similar both after adjustment for covariates and when analyses were conducted separately by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status and ethnicity/study subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found substantial differences between published IR indexes in the prediction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with ISI(0,120) consistently showing the strongest prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This index may reflect other aspects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis in addition to IR, which might explain its strong predictive abilities despite its moderate correlation with direct measures of IR </plain></SENT>
