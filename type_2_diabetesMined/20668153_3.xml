<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the role of urinary type IV collagen in predicting development and progression of early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and deterioration of renal function in a longitudinal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 254, 185 with normoalbuminuria and 69 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>) were enrolled in an observational follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations of urinary type IV collagen with progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and annual decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, urinary type IV collagen levels were higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> than in those with normoalbuminuria and correlated with urinary beta(2)-microglobulin (beta = 0.57, P &lt; 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (beta = 0.15, P &lt; 0.01), eGFR (beta = 0.15, P &lt; 0.01), and urinary albumin excretion rate (beta = 0.13, P = 0.01) as determined by multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up study (median duration 8 years), urinary type IV collagen level at baseline was not associated with progression to a higher stage of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the level of urinary type IV collagen inversely correlated with the annual decline in eGFR (gamma = -0.34, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis identified urinary type IV collagen, eGFR at baseline, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as factors associated with the annual decline in eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that high urinary excretion of type IV collagen is associated with deterioration of renal function in type 2 diabetic patients without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
