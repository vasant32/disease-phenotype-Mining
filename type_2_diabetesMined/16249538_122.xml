<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the correlates of patient and provider attitudes toward insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data are from surveys of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not taking insulin (n = 2,061) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care providers (nurses = 1,109; physicians = 2,681) in 13 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis is used to identify correlates of attitudes toward insulin therapy among patients, physicians, and nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient and provider attitudes differ significantly across countries, controlling for individual characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients rate the clinical efficacy of insulin as low and would blame themselves if they had to start insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Self-blame is significantly lower among those who have better diet and exercise adherence and less <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who are not managing their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> well (poor perceived control, more complications, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress) are significantly more likely to see insulin therapy as potentially beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most nurses and general practitioners (50-55%) delay insulin therapy until absolutely necessary, but specialists and opinion leaders are less likely to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delay of insulin therapy is significantly less likely when physicians and nurses see their patients as more adherent to medication or appointment regimens, view insulin as more efficacious, and when they are less likely to delay oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patient and provider resistance to insulin therapy is substantial, and for providers it is part of a larger pattern of reluctance to prescribe blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interventions to facilitate timely initiation of insulin therapy will need to address factors associated with this resistance </plain></SENT>
