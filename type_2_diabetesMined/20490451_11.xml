<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined associations between 25 confirmed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk variants and birthweight in individuals from the Danish Inter99 population and in meta-analyses including Inter99 data and reported studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Midwife records from the Danish State Archives provided information on mother's age and parity, as well as birthweight, length at birth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> of the newborn in 4,744 individuals of the population-based Inter99 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 25 risk alleles showing genome-wide associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Birthweight was inversely associated with the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles of ADCY5 rs11708067 (beta = -33 g [95% CI -55, -10], p = 0.004) and CDKAL1 rs7756992 (beta = -22 g [95% CI -43, -1], p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association for the latter locus was confirmed in a meta-analysis (n = 24,885) (beta = -20 g [95% CI -29, -11], p = 5 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HHEX-IDE rs1111875 variant showed no significant association among Danes (p = 0.09); however, in a meta-analysis (n = 25,164) this type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk allele was associated with lower birthweight (beta = -16 g [95% CI -24, -8], p = 8 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On average, individuals with high genetic risk (&gt;or=25 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles) weighed marginally less at birth than those with low genetic risk (&lt;25 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles) (beta = -35 g [95% CI -69, -2], p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We report a novel association between the fetal ADCY5 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk allele and <z:mp ids='MP_0009674'>decreased birthweight</z:mp>, and confirm in meta-analyses associations between <z:mp ids='MP_0009674'>decreased birthweight</z:mp> and the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles of HHEX-IDE and CDKAL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No strong general effect on birthweight can be ascribed to the 25 common type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles </plain></SENT>
