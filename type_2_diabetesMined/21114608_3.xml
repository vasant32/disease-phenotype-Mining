<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 87 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who failed to achieve glycaemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, effects of 6-month sulphonylurea in addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on reductions in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) levels were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduction in HbA1c and FPG in response to 6-month sulphonylurea treatment was significantly higher in patients with CC genotype compared to those with the CT+TT genotype (1.16 ± 0.07 vs. 0.86 ± 0.07%, p = 0.003; 1.57 ± 0.12 vs. 1.14 ± 0.14 mmol/l, p = 0.031, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, baseline HbA1c and the TCF7L2 genotype were the only significant predictors of HbA1c reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the magnitude of HbA1c and FPG reductions after 6-month sulphonylurea treatment in addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is related to the TCF7L2 gene polymorphism </plain></SENT>
