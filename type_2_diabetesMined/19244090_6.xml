<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 72 healthy individuals (22-56 years) were enrolled in this randomized controlled crossover trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After washout, two interventions for 3 weeks followed: <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> (concentration 12.5%), beer (5.6%), or red wine (12.5%) equivalent to 30 g <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>/day for men and 20 g/day for women or the same de-alcoholized beverages or water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among women, adiponectin significantly increased after consuming red wine (29.8%, P &lt; 0.05) and increased among men after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> solution (17.4%, P &lt; 0.05) and consuming beer (16.1%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>De-alcoholized beverages had no substantial effect on adiponectin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate amounts of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-containing beverages increased adiponectin concentrations, but sex-specific effects might depend on type of beverage consumed </plain></SENT>
