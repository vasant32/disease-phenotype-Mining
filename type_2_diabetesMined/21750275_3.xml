<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity decreases with increasing 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels based on an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) in overweight youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 147 overweight (BMI ≥85th percentile for age and sex) youth, aged 8 to &lt;20 years, undertook three tests: 1) a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp; 2) a 2-h hyperglycemic clamp; and 3) a 2-h OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were categorically assigned to five groups according to their OGTT 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, ranging from &lt;120 to ≥200 mg/dL. β-Cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, assessed by clamp disposition index (DI) and oral disposition index (DI(O)), were compared among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity, first-phase insulin, and DI declined significantly as 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest DI was found in youth with 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations &lt;120 mg/dL, with a significant decline of ~40% in those with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations between 120 and &lt;140 mg/dL, and an ~75% decline, the lowest DI, in youth with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations ≥200 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were similar with regard to the OGTT DI(O) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data in overweight youth demonstrate that impairment in insulin secretion relative to insulin sensitivity is apparent even with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Below the current cutoff of 140 mg/dL for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, there is a &gt;30% decline in β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Against this back drop of metabolically heightened risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, preventive measures should target the β-cell alongside insulin sensitization </plain></SENT>
