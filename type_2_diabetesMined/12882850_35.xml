<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tested the effectiveness of the Mediterranean Lifestyle Program (MLP), a comprehensive lifestyle self-management program (Mediterranean low-saturated fat diet, stress management training, exercise, group support, and smoking cessation), in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 279) were randomized to either usual care (control) or treatment (MLP) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MLP participants took part in an initial 3-day retreat, followed by 6 months of weekly meetings, to learn and practice program components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biological end points were changes in HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, BMI, blood pressure, plasma fatty acids, and flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Impact on quality of life was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate ANCOVAs revealed significantly greater improvements in the MLP condition compared with the usual care group on HbA(1c), BMI, plasma fatty acids, and quality of life at the 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patterns favoring intervention were seen in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and flexibility but did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can make comprehensive lifestyle changes that may lead to clinically significant improvements in glycemic control, some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk factors, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
