<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>11beta-HSD-1 is particularly expressed in adipocytes and liver and appears to be causally linked to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liver X receptor (LXR)-alpha and -beta are nuclear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterol</z:chebi> receptors whose key role in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolic regulation has recently been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that treatment of adipocytes derived from 3T3-L1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro with synthetic or natural LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> decreases <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of 11beta-HSD-1 by approximately 50%, paralleled by a significant decline in 11beta-HSD-1 enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of 11beta-HSD-1 mRNA by LXRs started after a lag period of 8 h and required ongoing protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, long-term per os treatment with a synthetic LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> downregulated 11beta-HSD-1 mRNA levels by approximately 50% in brown adipose tissue and liver of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> but not of LXRalpha(-/-)beta(-/-) mice and was paralleled by downregulation of hepatic PEPCK expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, LXR ligands could mediate beneficial metabolic effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndromes including type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by interfering with peripheral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> activation </plain></SENT>
