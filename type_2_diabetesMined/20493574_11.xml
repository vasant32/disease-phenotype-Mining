<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the RR was analyzed by combining 18 prospective cohort studies that matched defined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variance in RR between studies was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall RR of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> persons compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight was 7.19, 95% CI: 5.74, 9.00 and for overweight was 2.99, 95% CI: 2.42, 3.72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variation in RR among studies was explored and it was found that the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was highly related with sample size, method of assessment of body mass index (BMI) and method of ascertainment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By combining only cohort studies with more than 400 cases of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&gt;median), adjusted by at least three main confounding variables (age, family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, physical activity), measured BMI, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> determined by clinical diagnosis, the RR was 7.28, 95% CI: 6.47, 8.28 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and 2.92, 95% CI: 2.57, 3.32 for overweight </plain></SENT>
