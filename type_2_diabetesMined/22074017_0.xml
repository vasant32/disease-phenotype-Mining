<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature search using the MEDLINE database of English language literature published between January 2005 and May 2011 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The review included retrospective or prospective observational studies that included 100 or more patients per treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The studies revealed significant reductions of -0.4 to -0.9% in A1C, -10 mg/dl in FG, -2 to -11 kg in body weight and -2 to -11 mmHg in SBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant reductions in the use or dosage of either oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medications or insulin after initiating exenatide treatment were found in every observational study that assessed medication changes, including reductions in dosage of up to 75% in sulphonylureas dosages, 22% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, 66% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZD) or TZD combination therapy and 75% in prandial insulin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review of observational studies, exenatide initiation was associated with significant reductions in clinically relevant outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvements in A1C, FG, weight and SBP in the observational studies in this review were consistent with improvements observed in controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
