<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials up to March 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 22 studies were included (17 on type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, two on type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, three on children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With regard to adults with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, our meta-analysis found a between-treatment difference of -0.4% HbA(1c) (six studies) in favour of CSII therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Available median rates of mild or overall hypoglycaemic events were comparable between the different interventions (1.9 [0.9-3.1] [CSII] vs 1.7 [1.1-3.3] [<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>] events per patient per week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total daily insulin requirements were lower with CSII than with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, CSII and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> treatment showed no statistically significant difference for HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of mild hypoglycaemic events was comparable between the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In adolescents with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and insulin requirements were significantly lower in the CSII groups; no data were available on hypoglycaemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only study performed in younger children did not provide enough data for conclusive inferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No overall conclusions were possible for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and adverse events for any of the different patient groups due to rareness of such events, different definitions and insufficient reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: CSII therapy in adults and adolescents with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> resulted in a greater reduction of glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, in adult patients without a higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No beneficial effect of CSII therapy could be detected for patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
