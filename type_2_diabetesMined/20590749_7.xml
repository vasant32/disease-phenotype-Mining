<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A research database of integrated pharmacy and medical claims was analysed using Cox models adjusted for age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, prior fracture and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for 540 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a 39% higher [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.46] incidence of fractures in men and women exposed to a TZD (n = 69047; age = 56 +/- 5 years; 59% men; 48% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>) compared with that in control patients (n = 75352; age = 56 +/- 5 years; 51% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men treated with a TZD had a higher likelihood of fracture than control patients (adjusted HR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38-1.56; adjusted HR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.34-1.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HRs associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (adjusted HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.34-1.52) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (adjusted HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38-1.56) were almost identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TZD use was associated with a higher fracture risk in women aged above and below 50 years and in men aged above 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings add support to the growing literature that TZD treatment is associated with an increased risk of fractures in both men and women, that effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> are similar and that fracture risk is increased even in younger women </plain></SENT>
