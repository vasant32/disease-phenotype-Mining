<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> is associated with decreased islet function and requirement for insulin therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine if ApoE genotype was associated with severity of islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, samples were genotyped from 32 specimens of post-mortem pancreas and from patients classified by disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from blood samples from Caucasian patients diagnosed with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, at age &gt;40 years, classified according to disease progression: group 1 on oral therapy for at least 10 years from diagnosis, (n=147) and group 2, requiring insulin within 6 years from diagnosis, (n=187) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoE genotype was determined by restriction-fragment length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA in pancreatic extracts (23 diabetic; 9 non-diabetic subjects) showed no association of ApoE polymorphisms with either degree of islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> or disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distributions of ApoE epsilon 2, epsilon 3 and epsilon 4 were similar in both clinical patient groups and in the non-diabetic group and unrelated to progression of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that the common polymorphisms for the ApoE gene are linked to amyloid formation or progression of islet dysfunction in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
