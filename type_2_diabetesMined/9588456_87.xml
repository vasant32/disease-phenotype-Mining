<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify loci influencing susceptibility to microvascular complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>) in Pima Indians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Affected sib-pair linkage analyses were performed on 98 diabetic sibling pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in both members and on 103 sibling pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in both members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four chromosomal regions with some evidence of linkage (P &lt; 0.01; logarithm of odds [LOD] &gt;1.18) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strongest evidence for linkage with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was on chromosome 7, where two adjacent markers, D7S500 and D7S1804, were linked both by two-point analysis (LOD = 2.73 and LOD = 2.28; respectively) and by multipoint analysis (LOD = 2.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional loci potentially linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were found on chromosome 3, near D3S3053 (multipoint LOD = 1.48); on chromosome 9, near D9S910 (multipoint LOD = 1.12) and D9S302 (two-point LOD = 1.28); and on chromosome 20, near D20S115 (multipoint LOD = 1.83) and GATA65E01 (two-point LOD = 1.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multipoint analyses showed two regions with some evidence for linkage to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>: chromosome 3 between D3S3053 and D3S2427 (LOD = 1.36), and chromosome 9 between D9S1120 and D9S910 (LOD = 1.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These linkage analyses suggest that a genetic element on chromosome 7 and possibly one on chromosome 20 influence susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic elements on chromosome 3 and 9 may determine susceptibility to both these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These loci could presumably influence susceptibility to the complications by influencing the microvasculature directly, by influencing the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, or by other unknown mechanisms </plain></SENT>
