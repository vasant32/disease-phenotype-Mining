<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) of dapagliflozin were evaluated in healthy Japanese subjects and in Japanese subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two studies were conducted: a single-ascending dose (SAD) study (2.5-50 mg) in 32 healthy subjects and a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study (2.5-20 mg QD for 14 days) in 36 subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability were assessed in both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single and multiple dose PK of dapagliflozin and its inactive major metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> (urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> parameters) were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> parameters were assessed over 14 days in the MAD study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in either study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In healthy and T2DM subjects, dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum plasma concentration of 0.5-1.3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systemic exposure of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi>, measured by maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve, increased proportional to dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On a molar basis, systemic exposure to dapagliflozin 3-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> was similar to parent dapagliflozin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a dose-related increase in the amount of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excreted in the urine (SAD and MAD), which was associated with dose-related decreases in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> parameters in subjects with T2DM (MAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin was well tolerated and showed predictable dose-proportional PK and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> parameters in both healthy and T2DM Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
