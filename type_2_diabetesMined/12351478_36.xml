<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The first step of the screening procedure consisted of the Symptom Risk Questionnaire (SRQ), and the second step was a fasting capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In subjects with an SRQ score of &gt;6 and a capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of &gt;5.5 mmol/l, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 11,679 inhabitants of the West-Friesland region of the Netherlands, aged 50-75 years, were invited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the inhabitants, 9,169 (78%) responded, and, of those, 417 had previously diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SRQ score was calculated for 7,736 participants, and 3,301 of those had a score of &gt;6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,885 subjects (87.3%) attended for capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic testing was carried out in 509 participants, and we identified 217 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these patients detected by screening, mean HbA(1c) was 6.7% (+/-1.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and high total cholesterol levels (&gt;5.0 mmol/l) were present in 70%, 33% had high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (&gt;3.0 mmol/l) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels (&lt;1.0 mmol/l in men and &lt;1.1 mmol/l in women), and 40% were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; or =30 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high response rate was the main feature of the screening by means of the Symptom Risk Questionnaire and fasting capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement followed by diagnostic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 217 diabetic patients detected by the screening were characterized by relatively low HbA(1c) levels and by a cardiovascular risk profile typical of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
