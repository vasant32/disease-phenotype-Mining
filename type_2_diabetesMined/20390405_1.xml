<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase 10 (ACAD10) catalyses <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fatty acid beta-oxidation, which plays a pivotal role in developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ACAD10 was analysed as a positional and biological candidate for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three SNPs were genotyped in 1,500 Pima Indians to determine the linkage disequilibrium pattern across ACAD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined by genotyping four tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a population-based sample of 3,501 full-heritage Pima Indians; two associated SNPs were further genotyped in a second population-based sample of 3,723 American Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations with quantitative traits were assessed in 415 non-diabetic full heritage Pima individuals who had been metabolically phenotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SNPs rs601663 and rs659964 were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the full-heritage Pima Indian sample (p=0.04 and 0.0006, respectively), and rs659964 was further associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the second American Indian sample (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination of these two samples provided the strongest evidence for association (p=0.009 and 0.00007, for rs601663 and rs659964, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative trait analyses identified nominal associations with both lower <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation rate and larger subcutaneous abdominal adipocyte size, which is consistent with the known <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of ACAD10, and also identified associations with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We propose that ACAD10 variation may increase type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility by impairing insulin sensitivity via <z:mp ids='MP_0010951'>abnormal lipid oxidation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
