<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography is a method used to show the ventricular functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A ventricular hormone, BNP is used to identify the changes in the ventricular function in early period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP which is a more stable compound with a longer half-life is used in measurement of BNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> (LVDD) was detected and NT-proBNP levels were measured in forty-four asymptomatic patients with ages of 30-70 and type 2 DM and control group consisted of 40 healthy individuals from the same age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NT-proBNP levels were found as 566.7 ± 738.5 pg/ml in the diabetics with LVDD detected, 166.3 ± 137.1 pg/ml in the diabetics without LVDD and 134.5 ± 77.2 pg/ml in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of NT-proBNP were significantly higher in the group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when the levels of NT-proBNP in the diabetic patients without LVDD were compared with the controls, the difference was not significant (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels were found significantly higher in LVDD group compared to the controls without a difference between the ejection fractions (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High levels of NT-proBNP was correlated tissue Doppler echocardiography findings in type 2 DM patients with preserved ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
