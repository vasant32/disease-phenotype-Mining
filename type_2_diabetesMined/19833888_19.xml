<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recently, results from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies have yielded a number of novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, conflicting results have been published regarding their effects on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we used hyperglycemic clamps with three different stimuli to test associations between these novel loci and various measures of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For this study, 336 participants, 180 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant and 156 impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant, underwent a 2-h hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subset we also assessed the response to glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 and arginine during an extended clamp (n = 123) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were genotyped for gene variants in JAZF1, CDC123/CAMK1D, TSPAN8/LGR5, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2/ADAMS30, DCD, VEGFA, BCL11A, HNF1B, WFS1, and MTNR1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene variants in CDC123/CAMK1D, ADAMTS9, BCL11A, and MTNR1B affected various aspects of the insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 6.9 x 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The THADA gene variant was associated with lower beta-cell response to GLP-1 and arginine (both P &lt; 1.6 x 10(-3)), suggesting lower beta-cell mass as a possible pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we also noted a trend toward an increased insulin response to GLP-1 in carriers of MTNR1B (P = 0.03), which may offer new therapeutic possibilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other seven loci were not detectably associated with beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles in CDC123/CAMK1D, THADA, ADAMTS9, BCL11A, and MTNR1B are associated with various specific aspects of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings point to a clear diversity in the impact that these various gene variants may have on (dys)function of pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
