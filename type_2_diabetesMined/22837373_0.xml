<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of adding cilostazol (100 mg b.i.d.) to standard-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (75 mg/d) (TRIPLE) compared with double-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (150 mg/d) (DOUBLE) and the influence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> (CYP2C19*2/*3, CYP3A5*3)and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B1(ABCB1 C3435T) genetic polymorphisms in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: T2DM patients were treated with TRIPLE (n = 41) or DOUBLE (n = 39) after percutaneous coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional aggregometry and VerifyNow were performed at baseline and at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was absolute change in 20-μM <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced maximal platelet aggregation (ΔMPA(20)) between baseline and switching values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TRIPLE versus DOUBLE showed greater ΔMPA(20) (22.9 ± 11.6 vs.12.7 ± 15.5%; difference, 10.2% [95% CI 4.2-16.3]; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carriage of one (β coefficient, -5.4%; P = 0.162) and two CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele(s) (-8.3%; P = 0.007) were associated with lower ΔMPA(20) in DOUBLE-treated patients, but not in TRIPLE-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among T2DM patients, adding cilostazol achieves greater platelet inhibition compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (150 mg/d), which is not influenced by genetic polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
