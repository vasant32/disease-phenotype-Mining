<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evidence on the long-term incidence of and risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in diabetic patients is scarce and mainly derived from studies in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence from developing countries is required for planning a well-co-ordinated approach to this public health problem in these countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objectives of present study were to estimate the incidence of and risk factors for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> using routinely collected data from a clinical information system at Isfahan Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Centre, Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: During the mean (standard deviation (S.D.)) follow-up period of 2.9 (2.5) (range 1-11) years, 3202 diabetic patients (1315 male and 1887 female) from Isfahan Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Centre out patient clinics, Iran have been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean (S.D.) age of participants was 48.3 (10.6) years with a mean (S.D.) duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 6.5 (6.7) years at initial registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was measured by standardised protocols, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was defined as at least in two consecutive measurements within 2 months a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure of &gt;or=130 and/or &gt;or=80 mmHg and/or taking anti-hypertensive medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 3202 patients free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> at initial registration who attended the clinic at least twice in the period 1992-2004, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was 20.8 (20.6 male and 20.9 female) per 100 person-years based on 9403 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was 22% lower among insulin-treated than non-insulin-treated type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> clinic attenders and it was greater with older age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a Cox's Proportional Hazards Model, male gender, and treatment regimen were significant independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smoking, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, had no significant independent association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> when other covariates were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings will help the identification of those patients at particular risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and strongly support the case for vigorous control of blood pressure on type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
