<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to a control (n = 8), continuous-walking (n = 12), or interval-walking group (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Training groups were prescribed five sessions per week (60 min/session) and were controlled with an accelerometer and a heart-rate monitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous walkers performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> training at moderate intensity, whereas interval walkers alternated 3-min repetitions at low and high intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before and after the 4-month intervention, the following variables were measured: VO(2)max, body composition, and glycemic control (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA(1c), oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, and continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring [CGM]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Training adherence was high (89 ± 4%), and training energy expenditure and mean intensity were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VO(2)max increased 16.1 ± 3.7% in the interval-walking group (P &lt; 0.05), whereas no changes were observed in the continuous-walking or control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body mass and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (fat mass and visceral fat) decreased in the interval-walking group only (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control (elevated mean CGM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and increased fasting insulin) worsened in the control group (P &lt; 0.05), whereas mean (P = 0.05) and maximum (P &lt; 0.05) CGM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased in the interval-walking group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The continuous walkers showed no changes in glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Free-living walking training is feasible in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Continuous walking offsets the deterioration in glycemia seen in the control group, and interval walking is superior to energy expenditure-matched continuous walking for improving physical fitness, body composition, and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
