<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Proinsulin C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is involved in several biological activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in vascular smooth muscle cells is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated its effects, in vascular smooth muscle cells in high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured with 5.5 or 20 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with or without C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (1 to 100 nmol/l) for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proliferation activities, the protein expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-beta receptor, the phosphorylation of p42/p44 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proliferation activities increased approximately three-fold under high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conditions (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> suppressed hyperproliferation activities that were induced by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This happened in a dose-dependent manner from 1 to 100 nmol/l of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (10 and 100 nmol/l) inhibited the increased protein expression of PDGF-beta receptor and the phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAP kinases that had been induced by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 100 nmol/l of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> augmented the impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in the high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These observations suggest that C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> could prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1504375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic macroangiopathy</z:e> by inhibiting smooth muscle cell growth and ameliorating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilisation in smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> may thus be a novel agent for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1504375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic macroangiopathy</z:e> in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
