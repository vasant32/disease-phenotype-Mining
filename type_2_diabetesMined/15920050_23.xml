<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine psychometric properties of the Self-Care Inventory-revised (SCI-R), a self-report measure of perceived adherence to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care recommendations, among adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used three data sets of adult type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients to examine psychometric properties of the SCI-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal component and factor analyses examined whether a general factor or common factors were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations with measures of theoretically related concepts were examined to assess SCI-R concurrent and convergent validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Internal reliability coefficients were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responsiveness was assessed using paired t tests, effect size, and Guyatt's statistic for type 1 patients who completed psychoeducation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Principal component and factor analyses identified a general factor but no consistent common factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internal consistency of the SCI-R was alpha = 0.87 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlation with a measure of frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors was r = 0.63, providing evidence for SCI-R concurrent validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SCI-R correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress (r = -0.36), self-esteem (r = 0.25), self-efficacy (r = 0.47), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (r = -0.22), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (r = -0.24), and HbA(1c) (r = -0.37), supporting construct validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Responsiveness analyses showed SCI-R scores improved with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> psychoeducation with a medium effect size of 0.62 and a Guyatt's statistic of 0.85 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SCI-R is a brief, psychometrically sound measure of perceptions of adherence to recommended <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors of adults with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
