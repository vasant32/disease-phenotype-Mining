<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nested case control design was used to investigate the study objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from the Canadian province of Saskatchewan was available from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2001; the average length of follow-up was 4.07 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 diagnostic codes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication prescriptions; prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was ascertained based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 diagnostic codes and antidepressant prescriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 2391 individuals with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treated with antidepressant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 53.6 (S.D.: 16.4) and 68% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, the concurrent use of selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) was associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (adjusted OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.35-2.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent use of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> and SSRI was associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to using <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals taking combination <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> and SSRI therapy should be closely monitored for development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
