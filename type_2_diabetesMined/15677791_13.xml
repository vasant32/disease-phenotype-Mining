<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic effect of I/D polymorphism on renal and cardiovascular clinical outcomes in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 1,281 Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were followed for 41.3 +/- 21.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal end points were defined as renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and events (need for dialysis, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt;/=500 micromol/l, or doubling of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> of baseline value &gt;/=150 micromol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular end points were defined as cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and events, which included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, and revascularization requiring hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was examined by PCR followed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of ACE gene I/D polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed a renal end point (n = 98) had higher frequencies of DD genotype (19.4 vs. 10.8%, P = 0.018) and D allele (41.3 vs. 31.8%, P = 0.006) compared with subjects who did not (n = 1,183) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative rates of renal end points were 10.0, 19.2, and 24.4% in the II (n = 595), DI (n = 539), and DD genotype carriers (n = 147), respectively (log rank P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multiple Cox regression analysis, the occurrence of renal end points remained significantly influenced by I/D polymorphism with a dominant deleterious effect of the DD genotype (DD versus II, adjusted hazard ratio 2.80 [95% CI 1.49-5.29]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no prognostic effect of I/D polymorphism on cardiovascular end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DD genotype of the ACE I/D polymorphism was an independent risk factor for renal but not cardiovascular end points in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
