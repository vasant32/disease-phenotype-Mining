<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of a theory-driven self-management course in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with screen-detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, taking ongoing medical treatment into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 196 screen-detected patients, receiving either intensive pharmacological or usual-care treatment since diagnosis (3-33 months previously), were subsequently randomized to a control or intervention condition (self-management course) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 2 x 2 factorial design evaluated the behavioral intervention (self-management course versus control) nested within the medical treatment (intensive versus usual-care), using multilevel regression modeling to analyze changes in patients' BMI, A1C, blood pressure (BP), and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles over 12 months, from the start of the 3-month course to 9-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The self-management course significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>reduced BMI</z:mp> (-0.77 kg/m2) and systolic BP (-6.2 mmHg) up until the 9-month follow-up, regardless of medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, intensive medical treatment was also independently associated with lower BP, A1C, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> before the course and further improvements in systolic BP (-4.7 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving both intensive medical treatment and the self-management course therefore had the best outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This self-management course was effective in achieving sustained reductions in weight and BP, independent of medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A combination of behavioral and medical interventions is particularly effective in reducing cardiovascular risk in newly diagnosed patients </plain></SENT>
