<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sample 1 comprised 845 non-diabetic offspring of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients recruited in five European centres participating in the EUGENE2 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples 2 and 3 comprised, respectively, 864 and 524 Italian non-diabetic participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals underwent an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening for the rs10811661 polymorphism was performed using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rs10811661 polymorphism did not show a significant association with age, BMI and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants carrying the TT genotype showed a significant reduction in insulin release, measured by an OGTT-derived index, compared with carriers of the C allele, in the three samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When these results were pooled with those of three published studies, and meta-analysed with a random-effects model, the T allele was significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> (-35.09 [95% CI 14.68-55.52], p = 0.0008 for CC+CT vs TT; and -29.45 [95% CI 9.51-49.38], p = 0.0038, for the additive model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, in our three samples, participants carrying the TT genotype exhibited an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) compared with carriers of the C allele (OR 1.55 [95% CI 1.20-1.95] for the meta-analysis of the three samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data, together with the meta-analysis of previously published studies, show that the rs10811661 polymorphism is associated with impaired insulin release and IGT, suggesting that this variant may contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by affecting beta cell function </plain></SENT>
