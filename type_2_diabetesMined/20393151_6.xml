<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An increase in the rate of gluconeogenesis is largely responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with the antidiabetes action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> being thought to be achieved at least in part through suppression of gluconeogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated whether the transcription factor KLF15 has a role in the regulation of gluconeogenesis and whether KLF15 participates in the antidiabetes effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here we show that KLF15 regulates the expression of genes for gluconeogenic or amino acid-degrading enzymes in coordination with the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liver-specific ablation of KLF15 in diabetic mice resulted in downregulation of the expression of genes for gluconeogenic or amino acid catabolic enzymes and in amelioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cultured hepatocytes to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> reduced the abundance of KLF15 through acceleration of its degradation and downregulation of its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> suppressed the expression of genes for gluconeogenic or amino acid-degrading enzymes in cultured hepatocytes, and these effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were attenuated by restoration of KLF15 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> to mice inhibited both the expression of KLF15 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in the liver, the latter effect also being attenuated by restoration of hepatic KLF15 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KLF15 plays an important role in regulation of the expression of genes for gluconeogenic and amino acid-degrading enzymes and that the inhibitory effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on gluconeogenesis is mediated at least in part by downregulation of KLF15 and consequent attenuation of the expression of such genes </plain></SENT>
