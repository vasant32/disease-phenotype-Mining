<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo>, however, might precede the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, especially in subjects with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess plasma levels of TNF-alpha and soluble forms of its receptors (soluble TNF-alpha receptors 1 [sTNFR1] and 2 [sTNFR2]) and to evaluate the relationship of the TNF-alpha system with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in lean, nondiabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared 20 lean offspring (BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2), 8 men and 12 women) of type 2 diabetic patients with 20 lean subjects with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, matched for age, sex, and BMI (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anthropometry and blood biochemical parameters were measured, and insulin sensitivity was evaluated with the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both men and women in the offspring group were markedly more insulin-resistant and had higher plasma levels of sTNFR2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha, sTNFR1, and other examined parameters did not differ between the studied groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both TNF-alpha receptors were related to waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fat-free mass (FFM), plasma total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>sTNFR2, but not sTNFR1, was also associated with insulin sensitivity (r = -0.49, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This relationship remained significant after adjustment for WHR, FFM, plasma insulin, and NEFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha system might be involved in modulating insulin action before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in subjects at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
