<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the advanced stages of the disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> worsens and insulin therapy may be necessary to achieve satisfactory metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies in autopsies found decreased beta-cell mass in pancreas of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>, a constitutive program of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> modulated by the Bcl family genes, has been implicated in loss of beta-cells in animal models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the effect of 5 days' culture in high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (16.7 mmol/l) versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (5.5 mmol/l) or hyperosmolar control (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> 11 mmol/l plus <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 5 mmol/l) on the survival of human pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>, analyzed by flow cytometry and electron and immunofluorescence microscopy, was increased in islets cultured in high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (HG5) as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (NG5) or hyperosmolar control (NG5+MAN5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting the expression of the Bcl family genes in human islets cultured in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 was unaffected by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> change, whereas Bcl-xl was reduced upon treatment with HG5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, proapoptotic genes Bad, Bid, and Bik were overexpressed in the islets maintained in HG5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To define the pancreatic localization of Bcl proteins, we performed confocal immunofluorescence analysis on human pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bad and Bid were specifically expressed in beta-cells, and Bid was also expressed, although at low levels, in the exocrine pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bik and Bcl-xl were expressed in other <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> islet cells as well as in the exocrine pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that in human islets, high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> may modulate the balance of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl proteins toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, thus favoring beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
