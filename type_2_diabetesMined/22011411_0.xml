<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>Hyperuricemia</z:hpo> is associated with several risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (UA) is able to affect 1-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in hypertensive NGT subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From a cohort of ∼1,200 uncomplicated hypertensive outpatients who underwent OGTT, we selected 955 subjects (548 men and 407 women) aged 45.6 ± 10.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory evaluations were performed, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was assessed by using the new equation proposed by investigators in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kidney Disease</z:e> Epidemiology Collaboration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Considering different stepwise multivariate linear regression models, UA was the major predictor of 1-h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the entire population, with NGT ≥155 subjects, impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant, and type 2 diabetic patients accounting for 26.0% (P &lt; 0.0001), 25.3% (P &lt; 0.0001), 13.5% (P &lt; 0.0001), and 13.5% (P = 0.003) of its variation in the respective models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We documented that in hypertensive NGT ≥155 subjects, UA is strongly associated with 1-h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, similarly to what is observed in impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant and diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
