<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish the benefits of lowering cholesterol in diabetic patients with well-controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and average/below-average cholesterol concentrations, but without established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT-LLA), 10,305 hypertensive patients with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) but at least three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects on total cardiovascular outcomes in 2,532 patients who had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at randomization were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, concentrations of total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> among diabetic participants included in ASCOT-LLA were approximately 1 mmol/l lower in those allocated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 116 (9.2%) major cardiovascular events or procedures in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group and 151 (11.9%) events in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98; P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the individual components of this composite end point, the number of events occurring in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subgroup was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although fewer coronary events (0.84, 0.55-1.29; P = 0.14) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0.67, 0.41-1.09; P = 0.66) were observed among the patients allocated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, these reductions were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and procedures among diabetic patients with well-controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and without a history of CHD or markedly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated cholesterol</z:e> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportional reduction in risk was similar to that among participants who did not have diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Allocation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> prevented approximately 9 diabetic participants from suffering a first major cardiovascular event or procedure for every 1,000 treated for 1 year </plain></SENT>
