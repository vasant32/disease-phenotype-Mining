<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is greater in racial/ethnic minorities than in non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) for those with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because previous research on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was limited to NHWs, racial/ethnic variation in an estimated measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The sample included 79 individuals with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed at age &lt;18 years (32.9% NHWs, 46.8% non-Hispanic black [NHB], 7.6% other/mixed, and 12.7% Hispanic) and their families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Estimated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (eGDR) (milligrams per kilogram per minute; a lower eGDR indicates greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) was calculated using A1C, waist circumference, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Mean current age was 13.5 years (range 3.2-32.5) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration was 5.7 years (0.1-19.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>eGDR was inversely associated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with that in NHWs, age-adjusted eGDR was significantly lower among nonwhites (NHB, other/mixed, and Hispanic: Delta = -1.83, P = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted eGDR was negatively associated with body fat, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, urinary albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>, parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and positively related to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, lower eGDR was significantly associated with older age, nonwhite race/ethnicity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001874'>acanthosis</z:mp>, and lower <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Minorities with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are significantly more insulin resistant, as measured by eGDR, than NHWs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exploring potential mechanisms, including disparities in care and/or physiological variation, may contribute to preventing racial/ethnic differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>-associated outcomes </plain></SENT>
