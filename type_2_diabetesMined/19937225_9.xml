<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low circulating levels of adiponectin and increased leptin and C-reactive protein (CRP) have recently emerged as novel diabetic risk factors, although their relevance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been characterised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we sought to determine whether adiponectin, leptin and CRP levels during pregnancy relate to the postpartum metabolic defects linking <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Metabolic characterisation, including oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing, was undertaken in 487 women during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the antepartum OGTT, there were 137 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, 91 with gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and 259 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adiponectin levels were lowest (p &lt; 0.0001) and CRP levels highest (p = 0.0008) in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leptin did not differ between the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance groups (p = 0.4483) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin (r = 0.41, p &lt; 0.0001), leptin (r = -0.36, p &lt; 0.0001) and CRP (r = -0.30, p &lt; 0.0001) during pregnancy were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with postpartum insulin sensitivity (determined using the insulin sensitivity index of Matsuda and DeFronzo [IS(OGTT)]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, adiponectin levels were also related to postpartum beta cell function (insulinogenic index/HOMA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>; r = 0.16, p = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indeed, on multiple linear regression analyses, adiponectin levels during pregnancy independently predicted both postpartum insulin sensitivity (t = 3.97, p &lt; 0.0001) and beta cell function (t = 2.37, p = 0.0181), even after adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, adiponectin emerged as a significant negative independent determinant of postpartum fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (t = -3.01, p = 0.0027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Hypoadiponectinaemia during pregnancy predicts postpartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and fasting glycaemia, and hence may be relevant to the pathophysiology relating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
