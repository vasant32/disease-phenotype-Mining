<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of deleting or blocking the A(2B)R on insulin sensitivity using <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTTs</z:e>) and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in mouse models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on A(2B)R transcription and signaling were measured in human and mouse macrophages and mouse endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ~42 kb encompassing the A(2B)R gene, ADORA2B, were evaluated for associations with markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of mice with the nonselective <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadensoine (NECA) increased fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and slowed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTTs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These responses were inhibited by A(2B)R deletion or blockade and minimally affected by deletion of A(1)Rs or A(2A)Rs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp of diabetic KKA(Y) mice, A(2B)R antagonism increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate, reduced hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake into skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> caused a four- to sixfold increase in A(2B)R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in endothelial cells and macrophages and resulted in enhanced interleukin (IL)-6 production in response to NECA due to activation of protein kinases A and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five consecutive tag SNPs in ADORA2B were highly correlated with IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> had a highly significant independent effect on variation in inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The strength of associations between several ADORA2B SNPs and inflammatory markers was increased when accounting for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> affects the production of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and the expression of A(2B)Rs that stimulate IL-6 and CRP production, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and the association between ADORA2B SNPs and inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that increased A(2B)R signaling in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increases <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in part by elevating proinflammatory mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Selective A(2B)R blockers may be useful to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
