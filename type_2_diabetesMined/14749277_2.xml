<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ALS is an inbred strain with low <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defenses produced by inbreeding CD-1 mice, with selection for susceptibility to alloxan, a generator of highly reactive oxygen free radicals and a potent beta-cell toxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine if the low ability to diffuse free radical stress would contribute to spontaneous type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development in alloxan-untreated males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> developed spontaneously between 6 and 8 weeks of age in alloxan-untreated males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further aging was accompanied by increases in body mass, progressively more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, and development of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transition from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> correlated with a decreased ratio of reduced to oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence that the increased oxidative burden elicited the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> syndrome was obtained by the systemic elevation of the antioxidative capacity through daily administration of R-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">lipoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">lipoic acid</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg) prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, reduced insulin levels, and increased free radical scavenging potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mouse model with reduced ability to diffuse free radical stress is of obvious interest because free radical-mediated damage is implicated in the pathogenesis and complications of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
