<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The molecular mechanisms underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to obtain a global picture of changes in protein abundance in skeletal muscle in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and those associated with whole-body measures of insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from ten healthy lean (LE), 11 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic (OB), and ten <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic participants before and after hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative proteome analysis was performed by two-dimensional differential-gel electrophoresis and tandem-mass-spectrometry-based protein identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four protein spots displayed significant (p &lt; 0.05) changes in abundance by at least a factor of 1.5 between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several proteins were identified in multiple spots, suggesting post-translational modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple spots containing glycolytic and fast-muscle proteins showed increased abundance, whereas spots with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> and slow-muscle proteins were downregulated in the OB and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic groups compared with the LE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in basal levels of myosin heavy chains were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abundance of multiple spots representing glycolytic and fast-muscle proteins correlated negatively with insulin action on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation, while several spots with proteins involved in oxidative metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function correlated positively with these whole-body measures of insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that increased glycolytic and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein abundance together with a shift in muscle properties towards a fast-twitch pattern in the absence of marked changes in fibre-type distribution contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The roles of several differentially expressed or post-translationally modified proteins remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
