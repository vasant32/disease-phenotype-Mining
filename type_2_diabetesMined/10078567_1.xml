<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested a maternal excess in the transmission of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of these reports rely on patients recalling parental disease status and hence are open to criticism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An alternative approach is to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hypervariable region 1 of the rapidly evolving noncoding section of mtDNA is suitable for investigating maternal ancestry and has been used extensively to study the origins of human racial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced this 347-bp section of mtDNA from leukocytes of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 63) and age- and race-matched nondiabetic control subjects (n = 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consensus sequences for the two study groups were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pairwise sequence analysis showed unimodal distribution of pairwise differences for both groups, suggesting that both populations had undergone expansion in ancient times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distributions were significantly different (chi2 = 180, df = 11, P &lt; 0.001); mean pairwise differences were 4.7 and 3.8 for the diabetic and control subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the diabetic subjects belong to an ancient maternal lineage that expanded before the major expansion observed in the nondiabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic trees constructed using maximum parsimony, neighbor-joining, Fitch-Margolish, or maximum likelihood methods failed to show the clustering of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (or a subset) of the diabetic subjects into one or more distinct lineages </plain></SENT>
