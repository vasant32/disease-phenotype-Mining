<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association scans (GWASs) have identified novel <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated how these variants impact <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, quantitative glycemic traits, and response to preventive interventions in 3,548 subjects at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP), which examined the effects of lifestyle intervention, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated loci, including EXT2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, HHEX, LOC387761, and SLC30A8 in DPP participants and performed Cox regression analyses using genotype, intervention, and their interactions as predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated their effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and secretion at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the selected SNPs were associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for ethnicity, baseline insulin secretion was lower in subjects with the risk genotype at HHEX rs1111875 (P = 0.01); there were no significant differences in baseline insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both at baseline and at 1 year, subjects with the risk genotype at LOC387761 had paradoxically <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp>; adjustment for self-reported ethnicity abolished these differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ethnicity-adjusted analyses, we noted a nominal differential improvement in beta-cell function for carriers of the protective genotype at CDKN2A/B after 1 year of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (P = 0.01) and possibly lifestyle modification (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to replicate the GWAS findings regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the DPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did observe genotype associations with differences in baseline insulin secretion at the HHEX locus and a possible pharmacogenetic interaction at CDKNA2/B </plain></SENT>
