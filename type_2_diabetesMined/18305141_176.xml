<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously determined, first, that metabolic endotoxemia controls the inflammatory tone, body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and second, that high-fat feeding modulates gut microbiota and the plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS), i.e., metabolic endotoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it remained to demonstrate whether changes in gut microbiota control the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We changed gut microbiota by means of antibiotic treatment to demonstrate, first, that changes in gut microbiota could be responsible for the control of metabolic endotoxemia, the low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and, second, to provide some mechanisms responsible for such effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that changes of gut microbiota induced by an antibiotic treatment reduced metabolic endotoxemia and the cecal content of LPS in both high-fat-fed and ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was correlated with reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, fat mass development, lower <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and macrophage infiltration marker <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in visceral adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, high-fat feeding strongly increased intestinal permeability and reduced the expression of genes coding for proteins of the tight junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the absence of CD14 in ob/ob CD14(-)(/)(-) mutant mice mimicked the metabolic and inflammatory effects of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This new finding demonstrates that changes in gut microbiota controls metabolic endotoxemia, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and associated disorders by a mechanism that could increase intestinal permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It would thus be useful to develop strategies for changing gut microbiota to control, intestinal permeability, metabolic endotoxemia, and associated disorders </plain></SENT>
