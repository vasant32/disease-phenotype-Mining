<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Following the recent Ongoing Telmistartan Alone and in Combination With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">Ramipril</z:chebi> Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) finding of adverse renal outcomes, dual renin-angiotensin blockade has fallen out of favour, despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> and antiproteinuric efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in high-risk severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, not studied in ONTARGET, whether combination treatment should be withheld or withdrawn is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examine the renal effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> (ACE-I) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy versus combination therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects attending a hospital <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> centre were selected as case (combination therapy, n = 120) and control (monotherapy, n = 480) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were matched for age, gender, ethnicity, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure (BP) and study duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified by BP, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> stage 1 (BP &lt; 160/100, n = 506) and stage 2 (≥160/100, n = 94), and by treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed for the primary renal outcome of eGFR decline ≥20 ml/min, over a median of 3.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In keeping with the ONTARGET study, for stage 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, combination treatment is significantly worse than monotherapy for the primary outcome of eGFR decline ≥20 ml/min (20 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for stage 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, this endpoint was reached less often for combination versus monotherapy (12.0 vs. 23.2%, p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment was also not detrimental in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> or eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min and was associated with fewer macrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> control is paramount and in the spirit of primum non nocere, these data are reassuring should clinicians choose to use ACE-I and ARB combination therapy in the very hypertensive diabetic patient </plain></SENT>
