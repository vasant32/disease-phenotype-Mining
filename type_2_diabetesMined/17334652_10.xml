<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether glucagon secretion is also influenced by an incretin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A glucagon suppression deficiency has been reported in some patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but it is unclear whether this abnormality is present prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>We therefore addressed the questions: (1) Is glucagon secretion different after oral and during intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>(2) If so, is this related to the secretion of incretin hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>(3) Is glucagon secretion abnormal in first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 16 first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ten matched control subjects with an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load (75 g) and with an 'isoglycaemic' intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glucagon levels were significantly suppressed by both oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.0001), but glucagon suppression was more pronounced during intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration (76 +/- 2%) than after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration (48 +/- 4%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences in the glucagon responses to oral and i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were correlated with the increments in gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) (r = 0.60, p = 0.001) and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 (r = 0.46, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in glucagon levels between first-degree relatives and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite the glucagonostatic actions of GLP-1, the suppression of glucagon secretion by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is diminished after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion, possibly due to the glucagonotropic actions of GIP and GLP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in this group of first-degree relatives, abnormalities in glucagon secretion did not precede the development of other defects, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
