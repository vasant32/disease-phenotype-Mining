<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of 3,128 men and 4,821 women, of whom approximately half had a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FHD) was categorised according to an OGTT: NGT, IFG, IGT, combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The homeostasis model assessment was used to determine insulin sensitivity and beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of early abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was two to three times higher in subjects with FHD and two to three times higher in men compared to women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both maternal and paternal heredity of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with an increased risk of having early abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> heredity on the father's side seems to have less impact on an increased risk of having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both waist circumference and systolic blood pressure were increased in subjects with abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, whereas insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with IFG had more pronounced impairment of beta cell function and insulin sensitivity than subjects with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: An FHD and male sex increased the prevalence of abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects with IFG had more pronounced defects of insulin secretion and action than subjects with IGT </plain></SENT>
