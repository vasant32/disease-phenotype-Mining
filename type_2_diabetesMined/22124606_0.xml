<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SPT can also metabolise other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoAs</z:chebi> (C(12) to C(18)) and other amino acids such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16977">L-alanine</z:chebi> and glycine, giving rise to a spectrum of atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to identify changes in plasma levels of these atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi> to explore their potential as biomarkers in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the plasma profiles of ten <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35785">sphingoid bases</z:chebi> in healthy individuals with those of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and diabetic patients (n = 25 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were verified in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Deoxysphingolipids (dSLs) were significantly elevated (p = 5 × 10⁻⁶) in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (0.11 ± 0.04 μmol/l) compared with controls (0.06 ± 0.02 μmol/l) but did not differ between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of C(16)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi>-based <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi> were significantly lowered in diabetic patients but not in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> but without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly elevated dSL levels were also found in the plasma and liver of STZ rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A principal component analysis revealed a similar or even closer association of dSLs with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in comparison with the established biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We showed that dSLs are significantly elevated in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and non-diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They may, therefore, be useful novel biomarkers to improve risk prediction and therapy monitoring in these patients </plain></SENT>
