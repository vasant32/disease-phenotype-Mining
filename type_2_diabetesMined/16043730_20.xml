<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In an unselected population study comprising 60,869 individuals, potential sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors were investigated in participants with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in types 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were self-rated by using the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Several factors were correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in types 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these factors were not different from those of the nondiabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comorbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> somatic diseases were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in type 2 but not type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, those without comorbidity had the same odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> as the nondiabetic population with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> somatic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> somatic diseases did not increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were shared with the nondiabetic population </plain></SENT>
