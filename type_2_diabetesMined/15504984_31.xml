<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The PTPN1 gene codes for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (EC 3.1.3.48), which negatively regulates insulin signaling by dephosphorylating the phosphotyrosine residues of the insulin receptor kinase activation segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTPN1 is located in 20q13, a genomic region linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in multiple genetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surveys of the gene have previously identified only a few uncommon coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have carried out a detailed association analysis of 23 noncoding SNPs spanning the 161-kb genomic region, which includes the PTPN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These SNPs have been assessed for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in two independently ascertained collections of Caucasian subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and two control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association is observed between multiple SNPs and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most consistent evidence for association occurred with SNPs spanning the 3' end of intron 1 of PTPN1 through intron 8 (P values ranging from 0.043 to 0.004 in one case-control set and 0.038-0.002 in a second case-control set) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the combined case-control data increased the evidence of SNP association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.005-0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the associated SNPs lie in a single 100-kb haplotype block that encompasses the PTPN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of haplotypes indicates a significant difference between haplotype frequencies in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case and control subjects (P = 0.0035-0.0056), with one common haplotype (36%) contributing strongly to the evidence for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios calculated from single SNP or haplotype data are in the proximity of 1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Haplotype-based calculation of population-attributable risk (PAR) results in an estimated PAR of 17-20% based on different models and assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PTPN1 is a significant contributor to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in the Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This risk is likely due to noncoding polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
