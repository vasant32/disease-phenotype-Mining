<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively investigated 148 cases of ISHL, whose age was more than 40 years, comparing clinical and audiologic valuables between diabetic and non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (16.2%) had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (16 male, 8 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> were significantly greater in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hearing in the affected ear was more impaired in diabetic than non-diabetic patients, although hearing in the unaffected ear and degree of recovery did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean BMI, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c values, and ultrasonographically determined carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and plaque scores in diabetic patients with ISHL were 24.0+/-3.7 kg/m(2), 9.8+/-7.8 years, 7.8+/-1.5%, 0.83+/-0.16 mm, and 3.8+/-2.8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 17 diabetic patients whose ISHL was treated with steroids, 12 required insulin for glycemic control during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with diabetic patients without ISHL, HbA1c value was significantly higher in diabetic patients with ISHL (7.2+/-1.2% versus 7.8+/-1.5%, P=0.0202) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, nearly 16% of our patients with ISHL had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and this subgroup was associated with more severe hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine which subgroups of diabetic patients are most likely to develop ISHL, which patients are predisposed to more severe hearing loss, and how various factors and treatments influence outcome </plain></SENT>
