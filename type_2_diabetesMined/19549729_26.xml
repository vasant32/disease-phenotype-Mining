<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the association between serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (SUA) level and subsequent development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched Medline (31 March from 1966 to 2009) and Embase (31 March from 1980 to 2009) for observational cohort studies examining the association between SUA and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by manual literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) for each 1 mg/dl increase in SUA were pooled by using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies included were stratified into subgroups representing different study characteristics, and meta-regression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of these characteristics on the association between SUA level and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search yielded 11 cohort studies (42,834 participants) that reported 3,305 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during follow-up periods ranging from 2.0 to 13.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pooled RR of a 1 mg/dl increase in SUA was 1.17 (95% CI 1.09-1.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Study results were consistently significant (i.e., &gt;1) across characteristics of participants and study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Publication bias was both visually and statistically suggested (P = 0.03 for Egger's test, 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for publication bias attenuated the pooled RR per mg/dl increase in SUA (RR 1.11 [95% CI 1.03-1.20]), but the association remained statistically significant (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis suggests that SUA level is positively associated with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> regardless of various study characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research should attempt to determine whether it is effective to utilize SUA level as a predictor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for its primary prevention </plain></SENT>
