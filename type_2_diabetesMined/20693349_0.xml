<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study characterizes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL), an activator of the complement system and thereby important for inflammatory activation, in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum (S)-MBL was determined at hospital admission in 387 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (median age 70 years; 68% male) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and genotyping was performed in 287 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events (cardiovascular mortality and nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) were recorded during 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median S-MBL was 1,212 μg/l (interquartile range [IQR] 346-2,681 μg/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects, 54% in the geno- and phenotype subgroup had a high-coding MBL genotype (median S-MBL=2,658 μg/l [IQR 1,715-3,829]) and 46% a low-coding MBL genotype (373 μg/l [100-765]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S-MBL did not correlate with age, BMI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events occurred in 136 (35%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>S-MBL did not predict events in univariable analyses (hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.85-1.01]; P=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In unadjusted analyses, the risk of events was lower in patients with a high genotype and S-MBL above the median for their genotype (0.49 [0.26-0.92]; P=0.026) than for patients with a low genotype and S-MBL below the median for their genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prediction capacity of the geno- and phenotype model was of borderline significance in adjusted Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> have MBL genotypes that are similar to those known in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The combination of a low-coding MBL genotype with a low S-MBL appears to be prognostically unfavorable, but the association is blunted by traditional risk markers </plain></SENT>
