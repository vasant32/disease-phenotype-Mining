<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the male ob/ob mice, IAPP and insulin contents began to increase at 16 weeks and continued to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the male db/db mice, IAPP content began to increase at 8 weeks of age and insulin content at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both contents continued to increase until 16 weeks, but drastically decreased at 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies using anti-IAPP8-17 antibody showed the increase of islet cell mass and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> immunoreactivity for IAPP in islet cells in the ob/ob mice at 24 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the db/db mice at the same age, the immunoreactivity was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and weak in many islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that genetic factors that are important in the manifestation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> influence the capacity of beta-cells to synthesize and secrete IAPP, and that IAPP synthesis and secretion change in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
