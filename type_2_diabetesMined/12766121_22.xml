<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The mid-1990s witnessed the introduction of new classes of medications to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that these newer classes have found a place in the therapeutic armamentarium, but details of their use patterns are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether antihyperglycemic prescribing patterns changed concurrently with new drug introductions, and whether such changes were related to changes in the underlying patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A sample of U.S. privately insured patients with suspected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified from the MarketScan Research Database over the period of 1997-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified among those continuously enrolled in the database for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug therapy episodes were defined by sequential fulfillment of prescriptions implying a continuous supply of a particular drug (or combination) of at least 30 days duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses were used to explore trends over time in drug prescriptions and patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regressions were used to isolate the impact of year from other variables on the likelihood of receiving prescriptions for a specific therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 232,020 unique diabetic patients had an average of 1.91 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drug therapy episodes between 1997 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> decreased, but monotherapy with thiazolidinedione, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and other oral antihyperglycemics increased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combinations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and thiazolidinedione; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and thiazolidinedione; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and thiazolidinedione each increased over the time interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin monotherapy decreased, as did insulin combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combination of insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> increased, whereas insulin and thiazolidinedione was stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The influence of year on prescribing patterns remained highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) after adjusting for patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antihyperglycemic prescription patterns in the U.S. have changed in recent years in parallel with, and probably as a direct result of, the introduction of different classes of medications to the marketplace </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall, the prescribing trend has been away from monotherapy with insulins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and toward combination therapies, presumably in attempts to reduce hypoglycemic symptoms and to achieve better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
