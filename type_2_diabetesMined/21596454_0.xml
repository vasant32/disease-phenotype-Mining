<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have performed a candidate gene association study in order to examine VEGF gene polymorphism association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (DFU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with (N=247) and without (N=241) DFU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Healthy control subjects (N=98) were also recruited from the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ARMS-PCR technique was applied for genotyping of VEGF gene SNPs at positions -7*C/T and -2578*C/A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of genotype AA was significantly decreased in patients with DFU compared with diabetic subjects without DFU (AA vs CA+CC, p=0.003, OR=0.44, CI=0.24-0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also there was a significant decrease in frequency of A allele in patients with DFU compared to the controls (p=0.02, OR=0.68, CI=0.48-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It seems that lower frequency of A allele in patients with DFU is conferring a protective effect which might be as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>increased angiogenesis</z:mp> in patients carrying this allele </plain></SENT>
