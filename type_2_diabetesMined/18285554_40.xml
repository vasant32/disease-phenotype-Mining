<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has become a global epidemic, and Asian Indians have a higher susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether Indians had any metabolic differences compared with Northern European Americans that may render them more susceptible to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 13 diabetic Indians, 13 nondiabetic Indians, and 13 nondiabetic Northern European Americans who were matched for age, BMI, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary comparisons were insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> capacity for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by measuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA copy number (mtDNA), OXPHOS gene transcripts, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase activity, and maximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production rate (MAPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other factors that may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates required to maintain identical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels during the similar insulin infusion rates were substantially lower in diabetic Indians than in the nondiabetic participants (P &lt; 0.001), and they were lower in nondiabetic Indians than in nondiabetic Northern European Americans (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>mtDNA (P &lt; 0.02), OXPHOS gene transcripts (P &lt; 0.01), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase, and MAPR (P &lt; 0.03) were higher in Indians irrespective of their diabetic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha concentrations were higher, whereas adiponectin concentrations were lower in diabetic Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite being more insulin resistant, diabetic Indians had similar muscle OXPHOS capacity as nondiabetic Indians, demonstrating that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per se does not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indians irrespective of their diabetic status had higher OXPHOS capacity than Northern European Americans, although Indians were substantially more insulin resistant, indicating a dissociation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
