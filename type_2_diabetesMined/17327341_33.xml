<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physical exercise is a tool to improve insulin sensitivity, but little is known about its effect on intrahepatic fat (IHF) content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the association of habitual physical activity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and adiponectin with IHF content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 191 (77 female and 114 male) apparently healthy, nonalcoholic individuals (aged 19-62 years; BMI 17.0-35.5 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IHF content was assessed in a quantitative fashion and noninvasively as a continuous variable by means of 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and habitual physical activity was assessed by means of a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>Fatty liver</z:hpo> was defined as IHF content of &gt;5% wet weight, and insulin sensitivity was estimated using the computer homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-2 indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A reduced prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> in the quartile of the most physically active individuals (25, 11, 25, and 2% in quartile 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively; chi2 = 15.63; P = 0.001) was found along with an inverse correlation between the physical activity index and the IHF content when plotted as continuous variables (Pearson's r = -0.27; P &lt; 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was not attenuated when adjusted for age, sex, BMI, HOMA-2, and adiponectin (partial correlation r = -0.25; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a higher level of habitual physical activity is associated with a lower IHF content and suggested that this relationship may be due to the effect of exercise per se </plain></SENT>
