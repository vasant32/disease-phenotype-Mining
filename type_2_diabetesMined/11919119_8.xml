<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, crossover, controlled trial was conducted with 28 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (seven women; mean age 58.1 years): 15 patients were normoalbuminuric (UAER &lt;20 microg/min), and 13 patients were microalbuminuric (UAER 20-200 microg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A chicken-based diet (red meat replaced with chicken) and a low-protein diet were compared with the patients' usual diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients followed each diet for 4 weeks with a 4-week washout period between </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GFR ((51)Cr-EDTA single-injection technique), 24-h UAER (immunoturbidimetry), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were measured after each diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In normoalbuminuric patients, GFR after the chicken (101.3 +/- 22.9 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)) and low-protein diets (93.8 +/- 20.5 ml x min(-1) x m(-2)) was lower than after the usual diet (113.4 +/- 31.4 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2); P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In microalbuminuric patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B levels were lower after the chicken (113.5 +/- 36.0 mg/dl) and low-protein diets (103.5 +/- 40.1 mg/dl) than after the usual diet (134.3 +/- 30.7 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the chicken diet reduced UAER (median 34.3 microg/min) compared with the low-protein (median 52.3 microg/min) and usual (median 63.8 microg/min) diets (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control and blood pressure did not change after the diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A normoproteic diet with chicken as the only source of meat may represent an alternative strategy for treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
