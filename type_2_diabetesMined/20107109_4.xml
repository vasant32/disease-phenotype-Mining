<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 38 healthy young Caucasian men were studied before and after bed rest using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique combined with indirect calorimetry preceded by an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TCF7L2 rs7903146 was genotyped using allelic discrimination performed with an ABI 7900 system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic analyses were done assuming a dominant model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first-phase insulin response (FPIR) was significantly lower in carriers of the T-allele compared with carriers of the CC genotype before bed rest, with and without correction for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incremental rise of FPIR in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> induced by bed rest was lower in carriers of the T-allele (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma glucagon levels were significantly lower in carriers of the T-allele before and after bed rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While carriers of the CC genotype developed increased hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 did not influence peripheral insulin action or the rate of lipolysis before or after bed rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Healthy carriers of the T-allele of TCF7L2 rs7903146 exhibit a diminished increase of insulin secretion in response to intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to compensate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as induced by bed rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced paracrine glucagon stimulation may contribute to the impairment of beta-cell function in the carriers TCF7L2 rs7903146 T-allele associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
