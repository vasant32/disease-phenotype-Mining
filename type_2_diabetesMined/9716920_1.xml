<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is a paucity of data regarding outcomes of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 447 Type 2 diabetic subjects (208 male, 239 female; age range 30-82 years, median 62 years; and of predominantly European origin) was characterised in a clinic survey in 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual status (dead or alive) at 1 June 1995 was ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 6 years, 289 subjects were confirmed as alive and 133 as dead--only 25 were untraceable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of those subjects identified as alive, follow-up clinical and biochemical data were obtained for 253 (87.5%) individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those subjects, glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> deteriorated from 63.1 +/- 18.7 mmol/mol haem in 1989 to 71.7 +/- 24.4 in 1995, P &lt; 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was evident at 6-year follow-up, 59.7% cases in 1995 compared with 39.5% in 1989, P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly there was an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) (33.6 vs 18.2% of cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (26.5 vs 19% of cases; P &lt; 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (71.5 vs 54.9% of cases; P &lt; 0.001) in 1995 vs 1989, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (odds ratio (OR) for 18 mmol/mol haem change, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.85), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.40-8.41) and known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR for 7 year change, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.24-3.80) were predictors for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is therefore a deterioration in glycaemic control in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 6 years and an increased prevalence of complications that present strategies in a multidisciplinary specialist <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic are unable to prevent on a sustainable basis </plain></SENT>
