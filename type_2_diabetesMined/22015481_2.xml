<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess whether glomerular hyperfiltration (GHF) could result in renal tubular damage in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reference value of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined in 248 healthy individuals based on serum CysC levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GHF was defined as an eGFR exceeding the sex-specific 97.5th percentile in non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 30 with GHF, 58 with norm-GFR T2DM, and 24 healthy controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tubular markers, such as urinary N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-Î²-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), as well as serum and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), were measured and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation of these markers with eGFR was analyzed in the GHF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GHF group had higher urinary NGAL and KIM-1 levels but lower serum NGAL level than the norm-GFR and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Slightly decreased serum NGAL and increased urinary NGAL levels were also noted in the norm-GFR group compared with those of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in the urinary NAG values among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis showed that eGFR was positively related to fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), HbA1c, urinary NGAL, and KIM-1, but negatively with serum NGAL in the GHF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher urinary tubular damage markers were found in T2DM patients with GHF than the norm-GFR and control groups, probably a direct proof that GHF is a deleterious factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
