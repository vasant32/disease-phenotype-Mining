<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) in a tribal population of Bangladesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cluster sampling of 1,287 tribal subjects of age &gt; or =20 years was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They live in a hilly area of Khagrachari in the far northeast of Bangladesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure, height, weight, waist girth, and hip girth were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> fractions were also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The crude prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6.6% and IFG was 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized (20-70 years) prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (95% CI) was 6.4% (4.96-7.87) and of IFG was 8.4% (6.48-10.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both tribesmen and women had equal risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the lower-income group, the participants with higher income had a significantly higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (18.8 vs. 3.1%, P &lt; 0.001) and IFG (17.2 vs. 4.3%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression, we found that increased age, high-income group, and increased central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were the important risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the tribal population was higher than that of the nontribal population of Bangladesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Older age, higher central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and higher income were proven significant risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among these tribes indicates that the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications will continue to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Evidently, health professionals and planners should initiate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in these tribal communities </plain></SENT>
