<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty overweight Latino children with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 8-13 years, Tanner stages 1-2, underwent an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting and 2-h plasma insulin values and OGTT-derived SI indices were compared with SI derived from a frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGTT) with minimal model analysis, before and after adjustment for total body fat and lean tissue mass, or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FSIGTT-derived SI for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects was 1.62 +/- 0.78 x 10(-4) min (-1) x (microU/ml), with no sex differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SI correlated (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &lt; 0.001) with fasting (r = -0.57) and 2-h (r = -0.58) plasma insulin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SI indices (r = -0.57 to 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for total body fat and lean tissue mass, or BMI, the associations between SI and either fasting insulin or fasting SI indices were no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the 2-h insulin and post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge SI indices maintained significant independent associations with SI, even after adjustment for body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In overweight, peripubertal Latino children at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the 2-h plasma insulin value and postchallenge SI indices are better independent correlates of SI than fasting values, after accounting for body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2-h insulin may therefore be superior to fasting insulin as a single blood sample value for clinical or epidemiological estimates of SI, especially when combined with assessment of body composition </plain></SENT>
