<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 7,148 known type 2 diabetic patients (3,366 men and 3,782 women) was identified on 31 December 1986 and followed up for 5 years (1987-1991) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Underlying causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates and were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cause-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates of diabetic subjects were compared with those of the inhabitants of Verona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 31 December 1991, 1,550 diabetic subjects (744 men and 806 women) had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 1.42 (95% CI 1.35-1.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest SMRs were for the following specific causes: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (SMR 4.47 [3.91-5.10]), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e> (1.83 [1.50-2.21])--particularly liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (2.52 [1.96-3.20])--and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (1.34 [1.23-1.44]), particularly cerebrovascular (1.48 [1.25-1.73]) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart diseases</z:e> (1.41 [1.24-1.62]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher than expected risk of mortality for cardiovascular causes was already present in the first 5 years after diagnosis and decreased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin had a higher risk of dying than those treated orally or by diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The highest SMRs in the diabetic cohort were for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mortality risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, although significantly higher than expected, was much lower in Italian type 2 diabetic patients than that reported for American patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The evidence of an early effect on mortality suggests that prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment should be improved </plain></SENT>
