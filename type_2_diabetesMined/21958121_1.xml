<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We assessed the efficacy of eight classes of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications used in current clinical practice [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, sulphonylureas, α-glucosidase inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, glinides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) analogues and insulin analogues] to reach the HbA1c target &lt;7% in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception through April 2011 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RCTs had to report the effect of any <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication on the HbA1c levels, to include at least 30 subjects in every arm of the study, and to report the effect of therapy after a minimum of 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were summarized across studies using random-effects meta-regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 218 RCTs (339 arms and 77 950 patients) met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients who achieved the HbA1c goal ranged from 25.9% (95% CI 18.5-34.9) with α-glucosidase inhibitors to 63.2% (54.1-71.5) with the long-acting GLP-1 analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive decrease of the proportion of patients at target for each 0.5% increase in baseline HbA1c, ranging from 57.8% for HbA1c ≤7.5% to 20.8% for HbA1c ≥10% (p for trend &lt;0.0001), with some difference between insulin and non-insulin drugs: for insulin, the proportion of patients at goal reached a plateau for basal HbA1c value &gt;9.0% with no further decrease, whereas for non-insulin drugs the relationship was continuous without any evidence of plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONs: There is a considerable variability with regard to attainment of HbA1c goal of &lt;7% among the different classes of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications; baseline HbA1c is an important determinant of observed efficacy </plain></SENT>
