<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally assumed that alteration of this property largely contributes to the impairment of insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, data in humans are scarce and it is impossible to correlate beta-cell mass and function with the various stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the importance of animal models is obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In rodents, increased beta-cell mass associated with an increase in the function of individual beta-cells contributes to the adaptation of the insulin response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reduction in beta-cell mass always corresponds to an alteration in insulin secretory capacity of islet tissue (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty and Goto-Kakisaki rats, db/db mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During regenerative processes following experimental reduction of beta-cell mass [partial pancreatectomy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9288">streptozocin</z:chebi> (STZ) injection], beta-cell mass increase is not associated with a corresponding improvement of beta-cell function, thus indicating that regenerative beta-cells did not achieve functional maturity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main lesson from experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is therefore that beta-cell mass cannot always predict functional capacity of the beta-cell tissue and that the functional beta-cell mass rather than the anatomical beta-cell mass must be taken into account at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times </plain></SENT>
