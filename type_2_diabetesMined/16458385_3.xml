<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the plasma levels of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and their relation with clinical and metabolic parameters in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of TAFI and PAI-1 were evaluated in 47 non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients and 31 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intra-abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat areas were measured by computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was evaluated by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique using artificial pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of TAFI (169.0+/-108.8% versus 103.7+/-52.3%; p&lt;0.001, mean+/-S.D.) and PAI-1 (82.7+/-54.5ng/ml versus 52.9+/-51.7ng/ml; p&lt;0.05) were significantly higher in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that the plasma TAFI levels are significantly and inversely correlated with the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR) (r=-0.42, p&lt;0.005) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the plasma levels of TAFI were significantly correlated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (r=0.47, p&lt;0.001) and HbA(1c) (r=0.38, p&lt;0.005) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of PAI-1 were significantly and proportionally correlated with the visceral fat area (r=0.42, p&lt;0.005) and body mass index (r=0.33, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between plasma levels of TAFI and PAI-1 (r=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that the plasma levels of TAFI and PAI-1 differently correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and visceral fat accumulation, suggesting that different factors are implicated in the plasma elevation of TAFI and PAI-1 in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
