<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the risk for autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults differs between socioeconomic groups and to compare such risk with that for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The inhabitants of the Norwegian county of Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>øndelag were investigated by questionnaires and clinical examinations on three occasions during 1984-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used information from a subset consisting of 56,296 subjects (participating in at least two surveys), including 122 incident cases of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (aged ≥35 and anti-GAD positive) and 1,555 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged ≥35 and anti-GAD negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with self-reported education and occupation were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High levels of education (university versus primary school) were associated with an increased risk of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 1.98 [95% CI 1.21-3.26]), after adjustment for BMI, lifestyle factors, and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case subjects with high levels of education had lower levels of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, tended to have higher levels of anti-GAD, and were more often treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, these subjects had a reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.57-0.82]), a risk that was partly explained by lower BMI and more physical activity (adjusted HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.74-1.06]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High levels of education are associated with an increased risk of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults, a finding that may be mediated by effects on autoimmune activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because the association is not explained by traditional risk factors, other, currently unidentified, environmental factors are likely to be involved </plain></SENT>
