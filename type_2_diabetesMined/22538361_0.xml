<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that genetic variants associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in Europeans would explain a similar proportion of phenotypic variance in a Pakistani population and could be used in Mendelian randomisation analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from 2,131 individuals from the Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation Trial (COBRA) in Karachi, Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals were aged 40 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combining information from multiple genetic variants showed that fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, BMI, triacylglycerol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure variants explained 2.9%, 0.7%, 5.5%, 1.2% and 1.8% of the variance in those traits respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk scores of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, triacylglycerol, BMI, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure variants were associated with these traits, with per allele SD effects of 0.057 (95% CI 0.041, 0.074), p=3.44 × 10(-12), 0.130 (95% CI 0.105, 0.155), p=2.9 × 10(-21), 0.04 (95% CI 0.014, 0.072), p=0.004, 0.031 (95% CI 0.016, 0.047), p=7.9 × 10(-5), 0.028 (95% CI 0.015, 0.042), p = 5.5 × 10(-5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects are consistent with those observed in Europeans, except that the effect of triacylglycerol variants in South Asians was slightly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mendelian randomisation provided evidence that genetically influenced, raised triacylglycerol levels do not causally affect type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk to the extent predicted from observational data (p=0.0003 for difference between observed and instrumental variables correlations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Genetic variants identified in Europeans are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in Pakistanis, with comparable effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are needed to perform adequately powered Mendelian randomisation and help dissect the relationships between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in diverse South Asian subgroups </plain></SENT>
