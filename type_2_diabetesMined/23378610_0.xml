<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously identified novel metabolites correlated with insulin sensitivity measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The top-ranking metabolites were in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and glycine biosynthesis pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify common genetic variants associated with metabolites in these pathways and test their role in insulin sensitivity and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using 1,004 non-diabetic individuals from the RISC study we performed a genome wide association study of 14 insulin sensitivity-related metabolites and one metabolite ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We replicated our results in the Botnia study (n=342) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association of these variants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in genome wide association study meta-analyses (GENESIS (including RISC, EUGENE2 and Stanford), MAGIC, DIAGRAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified four associations with three metabolites; glycine (rs715 at CPS1), serine (rs478093 at PHGDH), betaine (rs499368 at SLC6A12; rs17823642 at BHMT); and one association signal with glycine/serine ratio (rs1107366 at ALDH1L1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no robust evidence for association between these variants and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants associated with genes in the glycine biosynthesis pathways do not provide consistent evidence for a role of glycine in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits </plain></SENT>
