<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors at baseline in a cohort of 6,358 sixth-grade students is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-two schools at seven U.S. sites were randomly assigned to intervention or control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Students participated in baseline data collection during fall of 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 49.3% of children had BMI &gt;or=85th percentile, 16.0% had fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=100 mg/dl (&lt;1% had fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=126 mg/dl), and 6.8% had fasting insulin &gt;or=30 microU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hispanic youth were more likely to have BMI, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin levels above these thresholds than blacks and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sixth-grade students in schools with large minority populations have high levels of risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HEALTHY intervention was designed to modify these risk factors to reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
