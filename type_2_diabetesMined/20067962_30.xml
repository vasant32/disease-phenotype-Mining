<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a myriad of metabolic aberrations including increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, increasing their cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their ligands play a key role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is a paucity of data examining the expression and activity of TLRs in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the present study, we examined TLR2 and TLR4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, their ligands, and signaling in monocytes of recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: TLR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, protein expression, TLR ligands, and TLR signaling were measured in freshly isolated monocytes from healthy human control subjects (n = 23) and type 2 diabetic subjects (n = 23) using real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, and flow cytometric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic subjects had significantly increased TLR2, TLR4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and protein in monocytes compared with control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased TLR2 and TLR4 expression correlated with BMI, homeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, A1C, N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl) lysine (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), and free fatty acid (FFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ligands of TLR2 and TLR4, namely, HSP60, HSP70, HMGB1, endotoxin, and hyaluronan levels, were elevated in type 2 diabetic subjects and positively correlated with TLR2 and TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic subjects showed increased MyD88, phosphorylated IRAK-1, Trif, TICAM-1, IRF-3, and NF-kappaB p65 expression in monocytes compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TLR-MyD88-NF-kappaB signaling resulted in elevated levels of cytokines (P &lt; 0.05), but increased interleukin (IL)-1beta, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and endotoxin were not significant when adjusted for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive study, we make the novel observation that TLR2 and TLR4 expression and their ligands, signaling, and functional activation are increased in recently diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and contribute to the proinflammatory state </plain></SENT>
