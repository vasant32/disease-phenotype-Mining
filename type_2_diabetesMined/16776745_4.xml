<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and most individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a pressing need to carefully evaluate the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on the efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> has been shown to adversely affect the efficacy of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs; however, less is known about the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on the properties of insulin and its analogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As patients near target HbA1c, the more postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> contributes to overall glycaemic control; thus, mealtime insulin, often supplied by a rapid-acting insulin analogue (RAI), becomes of increasing importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As glycaemic targets set by professional bodies become lower and poor glycaemic control becomes increasingly less acceptable, earlier addition of RAIs to patients' treatment regimens may be required to meet these targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in clinical practice, multiple barriers have challenged the acceptance and effective use of insulin therapy, including concern that it may cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RAIs should ideally maintain their rapid-acting pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) profiles, irrespective of subcutaneous body fat, skin thickness and body mass index, in order to effectively meet intensive treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, initial PK/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> data with insulin glulisine in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals suggest that this RAI may maintain its rapid-acting profile better than insulin lispro in the first 2 hours post-injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, data are preliminary and a thorough analysis of the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RAIs in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the potential impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on RAIs and presents an overview of investigations in this area </plain></SENT>
