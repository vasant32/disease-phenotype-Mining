<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PC activity is preserved in the islets of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> animals, but it is reduced in the islets of animal models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that PC is important in beta cell adaptation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and that PC reduction may lead to beta cell failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To confirm the significance of PC, we first lowered activity using Pc (now known as Pcx) small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) in INS-1 cells and in dispersed rat islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, we overexpressed PC in INS-1 cells, and third, we inhibited PDH by overexpressing the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) in INS-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of INS-1 cells or dispersed rat islet cells with Pc siRNA resulted in a significant reduction in insulin secretion in both cell types and reduced proliferation in INS-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This treatment also reduced the content of oxaloacetate, malate and ATP, as well as the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18009">NADP(+)</z:chebi> ratio and activity of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>-malate shuttle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of PC in INS-1 cells led to an elevation of insulin secretion and cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of PDH activity by overexpressing Pdk4 in INS-1 cells did not reduce insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that the PC pathway in beta cells might play a key role in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> metabolism, insulin secretion and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
