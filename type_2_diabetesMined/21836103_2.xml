<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk, and program adherence in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> compared with overweight (BMI 25 to &lt;30 kg/m(2)), class I (BMI 30 to &lt;35 kg/m(2)), and class II (BMI 35 to &lt;40 kg/m(2)) <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants in the Action for Health in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (Look AHEAD) trial were randomly assigned to ILI or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> support and education (DSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DSE participants received a less intense educational intervention, whereas ILI participants received an intensive behavioral treatment to increase physical activity (PA) and reduce caloric intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article focuses on the 2,503 ILI participants (age 58.6 ± 6.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 1 year, severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants in the ILI group lost -9.04 ± 7.6% of initial body weight, which was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than ILI participants who were overweight (-7.43 ± 5.6%) and comparable to class I (-8.72 ± 6.4%) and class II <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (-8.64 ± 7.4%) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BMI groups had comparable improvements in fitness, PA, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, blood pressure, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HbA(1c) at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ILI treatment session attendance was excellent and did not differ among weight categories (severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 80% vs. others 83%; P = 0.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants in the ILI group had similar adherence, percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk compared with less <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Behavioral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> programs should be considered an effective option for this population </plain></SENT>
