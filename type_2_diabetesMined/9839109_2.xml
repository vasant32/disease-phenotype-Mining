<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the possible association between serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [Lp(a)] concentration and proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) in Korean patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 412 Korean outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was determined by an ophthalmologist using fundoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum Lp(a) levels were measured by two-site sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> had higher serum Lp(a) levels than those with no diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or with nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NPDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that high serum Lp(a) levels and the presence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were independent variables having a statistically significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Korean type 2 diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> had higher serum Lp(a) levels versus those with no diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or with NPDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although these results suggest that Lp(a) might play a role in the occlusion of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> capillaries leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>, further prospective studies are required to prove the causal relationship </plain></SENT>
