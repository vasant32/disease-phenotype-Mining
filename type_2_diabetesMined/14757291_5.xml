<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were supplied from medical records, and postal questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among subjects aged 35-65 years differed between the PHCCs, with standardised rates between 1.7 and 3.6%, with the highest figure at the PHCC in an underprivileged area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was higher among men (2.8% versus 1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of the patients, i.e. 389 subjects aged 35-64 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was studied with regard to complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher education level was protective for microvascular complications (OR 0.50; CI 0.25-1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, microvascular complications were predicted by male sex, duration, HbA(1c), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and macrovascular complications by male sex, age, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and microvascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, are associated with lower socio-economic status and male sex </plain></SENT>
