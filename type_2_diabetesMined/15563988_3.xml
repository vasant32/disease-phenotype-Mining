<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Outpatients with either type 1 (n = 23) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 124), and non-diabetic subjects (n = 118) received an interview regarding the diabetic status of each of their family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 22% (5 out of 23) had a parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these 5 parents was assessed as type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the type 1 diabetic probands (22%) was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than that in non-diabetic probands (7%, 8 out of 118) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In probands with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the prevalence of parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 39% (48 out of 124), which was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0005) than that in the non-diabetic probands (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the type 2 diabetic probands, no significant difference was noted in the prevalence between paternal (19%, 23 out of 124) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> (23%, 28 out of 124), suggesting no preferential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present interview-based assessment of family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suggested a common genetic basis between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
