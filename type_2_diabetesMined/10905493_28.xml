<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine the metabolic pathways by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> improves insulin responsiveness in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the rate of muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis was measured by <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi>-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate-controlling steps of insulin-stimulated muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were assessed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>-NMR spectroscopic measurement of intramuscular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate (G-6-P) combined with a novel <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi>-NMR method to assess intracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven healthy nonsmoking subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied before and after completion of 3 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (400 mg/day) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, rates of insulin-stimulated whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake increased by 58+/-11%, from 629+/-82 to 987+/-156 micromol x m(-2) x min(-1) (P = 0.008), which was associated with an approximately 3-fold increase in rates of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation (from 119+/-41 to 424+/-70 micromol x m(-2) x min(-1); P = 0.018) and muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis (26+/-17 vs. 83+/-35 micromol x l(-1) muscle x min(-1); P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treatment, muscle G-6-P concentrations increased by 0.083+/-0.019 mmol/l (P = 0.008 vs. pretreatment) during the hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, compared with no significant changes in intramuscular G-6-P concentrations in the pretreatment study, reflecting an improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport and/or hexokinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of intracellular free <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not differ between the pre- and posttreatment studies and remained &gt;50-fold lower in concentration (&lt;0.1 mmol/l) than what would be expected if hexokinase activity was rate-controlling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> improves insulin responsiveness in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by facilitating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity, which thereby leads to increased rates of muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
