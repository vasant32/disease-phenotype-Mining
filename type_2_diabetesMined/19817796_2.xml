<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>K-ATP channel openers, of which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> is the most studied, are potentially useful because experimental studies show that they can counteract <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> over-stimulation of beta-cells and protect against toxic conditions, including relative <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms may underlie the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi>; these may include both indirect (counteracting over-stimulation) and direct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Side effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> have limited its use in human trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have tested lower doses than previously of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> and thereby largely eliminated side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this setting, we demonstrate positive effects on beta-cell function in type 2 diabetic patients who were simultaneously treated with bedtime insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, such effects were absent in insulin-na√Øve patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients, a 6-month intervention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> failed to result in better preservation of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>K-ATP channel openers have a potential to improve beta-cell function in subgroups of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analogues of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> with more potency in relation to side effects would heighten the possibilities for K-ATP channel openers to be of therapeutic use in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
