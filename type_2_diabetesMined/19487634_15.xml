<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Older patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at a particularly high risk for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo>, and experimental studies in healthy subjects hint at a reduced awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in aged humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, subjective responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> have rarely been assessed in older type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We tested hormonal, subjective, and cognitive responses (reaction time) to 30-min steady-state <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> at a level of 2.8 mmol/l in 13 older (&gt; or =65 years) and 13 middle-aged (39-64 years) type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Hormonal counterregulatory responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> did not differ between older and middle-aged patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, middle-aged patients showed a pronounced increase in autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptom scores at the end of the hypoglycemic plateau that was not observed in older patients (both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, seven middle-aged patients, but only one older participant, correctly estimated their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration to be &lt;3.3 mmol/l during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A profound prolongation of reaction times induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in both groups persisted even after 30 min of subsequent euglycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate marked subjective unawareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in older type 2 diabetic patients that does not depend on altered neuroendocrine counterregulation and may contribute to the increased probability of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> frequently reported in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The joint occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> unawareness and deteriorated cognitive function is a critical factor to be carefully considered in the treatment of older patients </plain></SENT>
