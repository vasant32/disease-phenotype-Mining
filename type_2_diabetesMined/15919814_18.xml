<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that a mutation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA-encoded tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the consequences of this mutation is a reduced aminoacylation of tRNA(Leu(UUR)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have examined whether variants in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32630">leucyl</z:chebi> tRNA synthetase gene (LARS2), involved in aminoacylation of tRNA(Leu(UUR)), associate with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of LARS2 cDNA from 25 type 2 diabetic subjects revealed eight single nucleotide polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the variants were examined in 7,836 subjects from four independent populations in the Netherlands and Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A -109 g/a variant was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies for the other variant, H324Q, were 3.5% in type 2 diabetic and 2.7% in control subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The common odds ratio across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four studies was 1.40 (95% CI 1.12-1.76), P = 0.004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in clinical variables between carriers and noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide evidence that the LARS2 gene may represent a novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which the H324Q variant enhances type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk needs to be further established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of association between an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2651">aminoacyl tRNA</z:chebi> synthetase gene and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results further highlight the important role of mitochondria in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
