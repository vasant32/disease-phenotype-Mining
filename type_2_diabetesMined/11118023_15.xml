<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory has demonstrated that insulin rapidly stimulates myosin-bound phosphatase (MBP) activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is accompanied by alterations in MBP activation and elucidated the components of the signaling pathway that mediate the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VSMCs isolated from Goto-Kakizaki (GK) diabetic rats (a model for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) exhibited marked impairment in MBP activation by insulin that was accompanied by failure of insulin to decrease the phosphorylation of a regulatory myosin-bound subunit (MBS) of MBP and inhibit Rho kinase activity resulting in increased myosin light-chain (MLC)20 phosphorylation and VSMC contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In VSMCs isolated from control rats, insulin inactivates Rho kinase and decreases MBS phosphorylation, leading to MBP activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to this pathway, insulin also appears to activate MBP by stimulating the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO)/cGMP signaling pathway because treatment with the synthetic inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, NO synthase (NOS), and cGMP <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blocked insulin's effect on MBP activation, whereas cGMP <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) mimicked insulin's effect on MBP activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VSMCs from diabetic GK rats exhibit reductions in insulin-mediated induction of inducible NOS protein expression and cGMP generation but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MBP activation in response to SNP and cGMP <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation led us to examine the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the activation status of the upstream insulin-signaling components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although GK <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not affect insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or its content, insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was severely impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by marked reductions in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that insulin stimulates MBP via its regulatory subunit, MBS, by inactivating Rho kinase and stimulating NO/cGMP signaling via PI 3-kinase as part of a complex signaling network that controls MLC20 phosphorylation and VSMC contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Defective signaling via Rho kinase and the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/NOS/cGMP pathway may mediate the inhibitory effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on MBP activation in this experimental model </plain></SENT>
