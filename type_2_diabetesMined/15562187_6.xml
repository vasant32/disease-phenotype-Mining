<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the mortality of people who were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 65 years of age with that of nondiabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a population-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> information system for an observational cohort study in Tayside, Scotland, people who were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the age of 65 years between 1993 and 2002 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nondiabetic comparators, matched for age and sex, were identified from the nondiabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two cohorts were followed up for mortality and cardiovascular mortality according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certification records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 3,594 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (48% male) and 7,188 matched comparators identified in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up period of 4.6 +/- 2.9 years for 3,594 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 7,188 comparators, 909 (25.3%) patients in the diabetic cohort and 1,651 (23.0%) in the nondiabetic cohort died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted relative risk for mortality in the diabetic cohort compared with the nondiabetic cohort was 1.06 (95% CI 0.94-1.19) for men and 1.29 (1.15-1.45) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> accounted for 49.4% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in people with and 45.2% in those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (adjusted relative risk 1.01 [0.93-1.10]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Men diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the age of 65 years have no excess mortality compared with their nondiabetic counterparts, a finding that was not replicated for women </plain></SENT>
