<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is thought to result mainly from environmental factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is compelling evidence that the decline of both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion have also a genetic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association studies identified several novel risk genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of these genes affect beta cell function by molecular mechanisms that remain unknown in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we and others could show that a group of genes affect <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, a group incretin-stimulated insulin secretion (incretin sensitivity or secretion) and a group proinsulin-to-insulin conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important so far type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk gene, TCF7L2, interferes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to advancing knowledge in the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the discovery of novel genetic determinants of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility may help understanding of gene-environment, gene-therapy and gene-gene interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was also hoped that it could make determination of the individual risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the allelic relative risks of most genetic variants discovered so far are relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, at present, clinical criteria assess the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with greater sensitivity and specificity than the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known genetic variants </plain></SENT>
