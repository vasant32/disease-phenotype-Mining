<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies were conducted in elderly patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 19, M/F 10/9, age 72 +/- 1 years, BMI 27 +/- 1 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 6.4 +/- 0.1%, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration &lt; 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and ten with diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent 2 studies in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one study, 0.1 u/kg of novolin R (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark) was administered at 7:30 am </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes later, at time 0, subjects were given 235 ml of ensure with fibre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other study was identical to the first except that insulin aspart (Novorapid, Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark) 0.1 u/kg was given at time zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> valuves were measured as at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles were nearly identical with insulin aspart and regular human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AUC for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (aspart: 6.9 +/- 0.1 mM; regular: 7.1 +/- 0.1 mM, p = ns) and insulin (aspart: 335 +/- 30 pM; regular: 330 +/- 25 pM, p = ns) did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin aspart appears to act similarly to regular human insulin in elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
