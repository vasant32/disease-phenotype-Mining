<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relative contribution of defective beta cell function vs diminished beta cell mass under glucolipotoxic conditions in vivo remains a subject of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to determine whether glucolipotoxicity in rats is due to impaired beta cell function and/or reduced beta cell mass, and whether older animals are more susceptible to glucolipotoxic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats (2 and 6 months old) received a 72 h infusion of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> + intravenous fat emulsion or saline control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo insulin secretion and sensitivity were assessed by hyperglycaemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo insulin secretion, insulin biosynthesis and gene expression were measured in isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beta cell mass and proliferation were examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 72 h infusion of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> + intravenous fat emulsion in 2-month-old Wistar rats did not affect insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion or beta cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6-month-old rats by contrast it led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> in vivo, despite an increase in beta cell mass and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was associated with: (1) diminished <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated second-phase insulin secretion and proinsulin biosynthesis; (2) lower insulin content; and (3) reduced expression of beta cell genes in isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this in vivo model, glucolipotoxicity is characterised by an age-dependent impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated beta cell function despite a marked increase in beta cell mass </plain></SENT>
