<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 39 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CAD were divided into two groups and received <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (2 g/day) or no <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forearm blood flow was determined using venous occlusion gauge-strain plethysmography at baseline and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forearm vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia (RH%) or nitrate (NTG%) was defined as the percent change of flow from baseline to the maximum flow during reactive hyperemia or after administration of nitrate, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical markers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or other standard methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RH% was significantly increased after treatment with <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (from 62.4 +/- 7.2 to 83.1 +/- 9.3%, P = 0.024) but remained unaffected in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">Vitamin C</z:chebi> decreased plasma levels of fV (from 143 +/- 5.4 to 123 +/- 6.03%, P = 0.038), vWF (from 133.5 +/- 14.5 to 109.5 +/- 11.4%, P = 0.016), and tPA (from 12.3 +/- 0.99 to 8.40 +/- 0.60 ng/ml, P = 0.001), whereas these levels remained unaffected in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes in RH%, vWF, and tPA were significantly greater (P = 0.028, 0.036, and 0.007, respectively) in the <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>-treated group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of ATIII, proteins S and C, fVII, and PAI-1 remained unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term treatment with high doses of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> improved RH% and decreased plasma levels of tPA and vWF in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CAD </plain></SENT>
