<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release of isolated human islets has been shown to deteriorate progressively with advancing donor age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This decline in beta cell function with aging may contribute to the increasing development of IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and also to the progressive nature of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was to see whether there is any change in expression of beta cell function-related genes in islets with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Islets were isolated from young (2-month old) and old (22-24-month old) LETO rats and C57BL/6N mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vitro GSIR index was significantly lower in islets from old mice compared with young mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In real-time RT-PCR, PDX-1, insulin, GLUT2 and prohormone convertase 1/3 gene expression in islets was markedly lower in old rats (33%, 13%, 20% and 34%, respectively) and old mice (56%, 42%, 28% and 22%, respectively) compared with young animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, genes not specifically related to beta cell-specific function, such as caspase 3, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase 2 and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> kinase were not significantly different in expression in islets according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, with increasing age, insulin secretory function of islets deteriorates accompanied with a decrease in expression of beta cell-specific genes including PDX-1 </plain></SENT>
