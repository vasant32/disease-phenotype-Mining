<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Exploiting the incretin effect to develop new <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatments has become the focus of intense research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One successful approach has been the development of oral inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These drugs reversibly block DPP-IV-mediated inactivation of incretin hormones, for example, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) and also other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that have alanine or proline as the penultimate N-terminal amino acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV inhibitors, therefore, increase circulating levels and prolong the biological activity of endogenous GLP-1, but whether this is sufficient to fully explain the substantial reduction in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and associated metabolic profile remains open to further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV inhibitors such as vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> have been shown to be highly effective antihyperglycaemic agents that augment insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion via <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the major clinical trials with DPP-IV inhibitors as monotherapy and as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of HbA(1c) reduction with DPP-IV inhibitors depends upon the pretreatment HbA(1c) values, but there seems to be no change in body weight, and very low rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and gastrointestinal disturbance with these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV inhibitors represent a major new class of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug and their metabolic profile offers a number of unique clinical advantages for the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
