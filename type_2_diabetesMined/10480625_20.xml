<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of human G-6-Pase-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion genes was transiently transfected into human HepG2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells, and the effect of insulin on basal CAT expression was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the IRU identified in the mouse promoter is conserved in the human promoter, but that an upstream multimerized insulin response sequence (IRS) motif that is only found in the human promoter appears to be functionally inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The G-6-Pase IRU comprises two distinct promoter regions, designated A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Region B contains an IRS, whereas region A acts as an accessory element to enhance the effect of insulin, mediated through region B, on basal G-6-Pase gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the accessory factor binding region A is hepatocyte nuclear factor-1, and we show here that the forkhead protein FKHR is a candidate for the insulin-responsive transcription factor binding region B </plain></SENT>
