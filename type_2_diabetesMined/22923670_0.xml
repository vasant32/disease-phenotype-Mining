<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> use is associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while avoiding previous biases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General Practice Research Database, we assembled a cohort of patients newly treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs) between 1988 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control analysis was conducted, where case subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> occurring during follow-up were matched with up to 10 control subjects for age, sex, calendar time, and duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> associated with ever use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, along with measures of duration and cumulative dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Models were adjusted for potential confounders, which included smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort included 115,923 new users of OHAs, with 1,061 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> during follow-up (rate 2.0/1,000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> use was not associated with a decreased rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (rate ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.76-1.17]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No dose-response was observed by number of prescriptions received, cumulative duration of use, and dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> use is not associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decreased risk reported in other observational studies is likely due to bias from methodological shortcomings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, greater consideration should be given to clarify inconsistencies between experimental models and population studies </plain></SENT>
