<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by a random sample of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registered with a hospital <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two-thirds of patients (65%) had spoken to at least one sibling or child about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were more likely to believe their family was at risk, to worry about their family developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and to be aware of the seriousness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results revealed greater awareness of family risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those from previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had already taken the initiative, without formal prompting, to talk to family members about their risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discussion of risk and interventions to reduce risk should be encouraged within families </plain></SENT>
