<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The following message was printed on the lab reports of individuals with a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) concentration between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/l: "A FPG between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/l is considered abnormal by the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An OGTT is recommended if the patient does not have a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and suffers from conditions associated with an increased risk for having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (i.e., overweight, <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, abnormal plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> or family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>)." The number of educational messages printed was 81,099 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intervention resulted in a significant increase in the number of OGTTs requested, from 78 +/- 19 to 268 +/- 48 tests per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also resulted in a greater proportion of case subjects that had an abnormal OGTT result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Educational messages in laboratory reports aid in the diagnostic workup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
