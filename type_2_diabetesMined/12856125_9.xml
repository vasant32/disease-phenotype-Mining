<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated pathophysiological changes of the heart and vessels in the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat Type 2 DM model during a long time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Echocardiography was carried out at 22 and 62 weeks of age of OLETF ( n=10, each) and age-matched Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats ( n=10, each) as a reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic measurements and histological examinations of the heart and the coronary and aortic vascular walls were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The left ventricular (LV) maximal -dP/dt was reduced in OLETF rats at 62 weeks (-1085+/-35 mmHg/s) less than that at 22 weeks (-1892+/-396 mmHg/sec, p&lt;0.05) and in LETO rats at 62 weeks (-1306+/-200 mmHg/sec, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries, capillary tortuosity and thickening of basement membrane were evident in OLETF rats at 62 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intimal and medial wall thickening of the aorta were prominent in OLETF rats at 62 weeks (15+/-2.2 and 90+/-6.6 micro m, in LETO rats at 62 weeks, 2+/-0.4 and 65+/-5.2 micro m, p &lt;0.05, and in OLETF rats at 22 weeks, 7+/-4.6 and 71+/-6.0 micro m, p&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In the Type 2 DM model, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e>, especially in coronary arteries including small vessels, as well as a LV relaxation abnormality, are induced in a late stage of DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These are considered to be important complications in Type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
