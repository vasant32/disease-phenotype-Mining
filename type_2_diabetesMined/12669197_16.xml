<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The T130I mutation is a rare missense mutation, which affects a conserved amino acid in a DNA binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mutation can be found in the general population, so this variant alone does not cause MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, its significance in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 423 unrelated Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 354 unrelated non-diabetic control subjects for the T130I mutation in the HNF-4alpha gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transactivation ability of T130I-HNF-4alpha was assessed using reporter gene assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the T130I mutation was higher in Type 2 diabetic patients ( p=0.015, odds ratio 4.3, 95%CI 1.24-14.98) than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration was lower in Type 2 diabetic patients with the T130I mutation compared with those without this mutation ( p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reporter gene analysis showed that T130I-HNF-4alpha transcriptional activity was not impaired compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HNF-4alpha in Hela and MIN6 cells, but it was reduced in HepG2 and primary cultured mouse hepatocytes (27-78% of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that T130I-HNF-4alpha is a loss-of-function mutation in hepatocytes and that this mutation is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The T130I mutation in the HNF-4alpha gene might be involved in the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
