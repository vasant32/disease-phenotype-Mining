<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into mechanisms underlying these observations, we applied comprehensive lipidomic profiling to specimens collected from healthy adults enrolled in a randomized, crossover trial comparing a high-PA diet to a low-PA/high-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (HOA) diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects on insulin sensitivity (SI) and disposition index (DI) were assessed by intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In women, but not men, SI and DI were higher during HOA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of HOA on SI correlated positively with physical fitness upon enrollment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women, this factor correlated inversely with SI in the fasted and fed states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medium-chain acylcarnitines emerged as strong negative correlates of SI, and the HOA diet was accompanied by lower serum and muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> concentrations and reductions in molecular biomarkers of inflammatory and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
