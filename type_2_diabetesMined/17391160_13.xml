<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data for the present study were obtained from the Phase 3 (n = 2350, response rate: 90.4%) of the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study, a population-based study done in Chennai, the largest city in southern India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IDRS was developed based on multiple logistic regression analysis using four simple parameters namely age, abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was obtained, and details on physical activity were assessed using a validated questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with an IDRS of &lt;30 was categorized as low risk, 30-50 as medium risk and those with &gt; or =60 as high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and anthropometric measurements were done using standardized procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minnesota coding was used to grade 12-lead electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean IDRS increased significantly with worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> [<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) subjects: 48 +/- 17, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT): 57 +/- 16, newly diagnosed diabetics (NDD): 61 +/- 15 and known diabetics (KD): 68 +/- 12; p for trend &lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among NGT group, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> increased progressively in low-, medium- to high-risk score groups; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>: 9.4, 22.1 and 38.2% (p for trend: &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>: 8.8, 19.9 and 25.3% (p for trend: &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>: 7.2, 20.3 and 34.9% (p for trend: &lt; 0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>: 1.8, 14.6 and 30.3% (p for trend: &lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CAD was also significantly higher in individuals with high risk compared with those with low risk (p = 0.030) and the medium risk (p = 0.050) in the NGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in Asian Indians, (i) the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk score increases with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, and (ii) it can serve as an effective indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and cardiovascular risk even among subjects with NGT </plain></SENT>
