<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assuming that the effects of the polymorphism were modulated by gender and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> which were related to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, we investigated this polymorphism and its effect on fat metabolism according to such factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were Japanese-Americans (123 men and 126 women) who were diagnosed as non-diabetic by a 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test at the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During approximately 7.8 years, 49 (24 men and 25 women) were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a Cox proportional hazards model, this polymorphism was not a significant variable in the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in either gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amongst non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men with the Thr54 allele, there was a significant elevation of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TGs) (p=0.033) compared with alanine (Ala) homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women with the Thr54 allele had significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>elevated total cholesterol</z:hpo> (p=0.033) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) (p=0.023) compared with Ala54 homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results therefore suggested that the effects of the FABP2 polymorphism on TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and body mass index were associated with gender difference and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> amongst non-diabetic Japanese-American subjects </plain></SENT>
