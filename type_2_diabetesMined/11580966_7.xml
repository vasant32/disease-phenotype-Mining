<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review the community-based epidemiologic studies of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Taiwan published during the last decade, and look at the effectiveness of a two-stage screening protocol for identifying subjects at risk for progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of these studies indicate that the age-adjusted prevalence rate of undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Taiwan is stable, at around 4.0%, while the annual incidence rate is about 1.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of several studies strongly suggest that a two-step screening strategy, in which only subjects with a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of 5.6-7.8 mmol/l receive the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, may be an effective means of identifying diabetics and persons at high risk for progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and, ultimately, slowing the increase in the prevalence of this disease </plain></SENT>
