<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of analogues for use as basal insulin, however, has been much slower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods of pro-tracting the time-action curve of injected insulin include complexing with proteins, insulin crystal formation, shifting the iso-electric point of the amino acid sequence or attaching a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35366">fatty-acid</z:chebi> side chain to the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter two methods have been more successful in producing physiologic insulin profiles when compared with the former methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The principle of acylation has also been applied to prolong the action of other hormones, such as glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1), as the native <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> has a very short half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results with this compound and other GLP-1 analogues show promise in treating patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, the development of new insulin and other hormone preparations by the manipulation of native <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> structure has recently improved our <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> armamentarium, and further research will continue this fruitful approach </plain></SENT>
