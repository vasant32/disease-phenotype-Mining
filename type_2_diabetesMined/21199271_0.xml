<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up time was 3.71 years; 96 subjects converted to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 55 allocated to placebo and 41 to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (absolute difference 9.8%; p = 0.072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the study failed to support the notion that low-dose SU added to lifestyle changes in IFG subjects would help to delay the conversion to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
