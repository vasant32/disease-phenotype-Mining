<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using administrative claims data (2000-2001) from a managed care organization in the Midwestern U.S., this study analyzed 900 enrollees, aged 18 years and over, with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were taking oral antihyperglycemic agents both years but who did not use insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonadherence was defined as a medication possession ratio (MPR) &lt;80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed where hospitalization in 2001 was regressed on nonadherence to the oral antihyperglycemic drug regimen in 2000, while controlling for nonadherence to drugs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and for hospitalization in 2000, age, sex, intensity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drug regimen, and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of enrollees who were nonadherent to the antihyperglycemic drug regimen in 2001 was 28.9%, whereas 18.8 and 26.9% were nonadherent to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-modifying drugs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in the hospitalization rate for 2001 was most apparent where the antihyperglycemic MPR for 2000 dropped to &lt;80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enrollees who were nonadherent to oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications in 2000 were at higher risk of hospitalization in 2001 (odds ratio 2.53; 95% CI 1.38-4.64), whereas nonadherence to drugs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> were not significantly associated with hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who do not obtain at least 80% of their oral antihyperglycemic medications across 1 year are at a higher risk of hospitalization in the following year </plain></SENT>
