<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven hundred Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function was evaluated by fasting CPR (FCPR), 6 min after intravenous injection of 1mg glucagon (CPR-6 min), and the increment of CPR (DeltaCPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simple regression analysis between FCPR, CPR-6 min, and DeltaCPR and measures of variables and stepwise multiple regression analysis were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Years from diagnosis and BMI were the major independent variables predicting beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Years from diagnosis was negatively correlated with CPR-6 min (P&lt;0.0001, r=-0.271), and decrease in CPR-6 min was 0.050 ng/(ml year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI was positively correlated with CPR-6 min (P&lt;0.0001, r=0.369) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When subjects were divided according to BMI, the decrease in CPR-6 min per year in the high-BMI group (0.068 ng/(ml year)) was greater than that in the low-BMI group (0.035 ng/(ml year)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A linear decline in endogenous insulin secretion over more than several decades of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was confirmed by this cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exposure and BMI are thus major factors in beta-cell function in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
