<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate diverse risk factors affecting the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) by observing the changes of 24 h urinary albumin excretion (24 h UAE) in 90 abdominally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight, type 2 diabetic patients with normo- or micro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups according to the 24h UAE; normo-, micro-, and macro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 4 years of follow-up, patients were divided into either progression or non-progression group according to the changes of 24 h UAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>About 37% of the normo-<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> group and 18% of the micro-albumiuria group were classified into the progression group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels and the initial and follow-up post-prandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the progression group than in the non-progression group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most remarkably, the initial and follow-up serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) levels (190 +/- 132 versus 132 +/- 49 mg/dl and 191 +/- 124 versus 133 +/- 41 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.01 in both) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the non-progression group, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> might be included in the progression factors of DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increases in 24-hour UAE were positively associated with the initial and follow-up post-prandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.05 in both), the initial and follow-up serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.05 in both), and the initial serum TG levels (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas, insulin users or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at follow-up (P &lt; 0.05 in both) showed more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05 in both) use turned out to protect against it </plain></SENT>
