<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed at two test sites (Cardiff, UK: Aachen, Germany) including 137 and 166 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 16 study centres any patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> capable of communicating by phone and able to perform blood pressure, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-measurements were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximum programme duration was 6 months at Cardiff and 4 months at Aachen, during which patients were assessed for glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk profile and the presence of complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were entered via the internet to a central server </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At entry into the programme the patient group in Cardiff had significantly lower mean age (60.3+/-9.4 years versus 64.9+/-8.7 years, p&lt;0.001) and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (6.1+/-5.7 years versus 7.4+/-7.0 years, p&lt;0.05) than in Aachen, however body mass index (31.6+/-5.2 kg/m(2) versus 29.5+/-4.9 kg/m(2), p&lt;0.01), HbA1c (7.7+/-1.2% versus 7.1+/-1.2%, p&lt;0.001) and systolic blood pressure (138.4+/-15.1 mmHg versus 133.5+/-11.5 mmHg, p&lt;0.001) were significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, total cholesterol (4.7+/-1.0 mmol/l versus 5.5+/-1.1 mmol/l, p&lt;0.001) was significantly lower in Cardiff compared to Aachen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following entry into the programme highly significant improvements in HbA1c (Cardiff from 7.7% to 7.1%, p&lt;0.001; Aachen from 7.2% to 6.8%, p&lt;0.05) and total cholesterol concentrations (Cardiff: 4.66-4.46 mmol/l; Aachen: 5.33-5.15 mmol/l; both p&lt;0.05) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in blood pressure at either site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care was delivered to DIADEM patients and relevant and significant improvements in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care were achieved demonstrating that an IT-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> disease management service can improve care for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
