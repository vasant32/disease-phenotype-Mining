<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine whether sleep duration and/or snoring are associated with biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 935 women aged 43-69 years enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study cohort with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had no history of documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on sleep duration and snoring frequency was collected in 1986 from mailed questionnaires, and biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were measured from blood samples taken in 1989-1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Longer sleep duration was associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein after adjusting for age, BMI, lifestyle factors, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, glycemic control, and medication use (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was decreased with short and long sleep duration among normotensive (P = 0.02) but not hypertensive women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More frequent snoring was directly associated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P = 0.02) and inversely associated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.03) and adiponectin (P = 0.03) in multivariate-adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The associations of sleep duration and snoring with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, hormone measures, and/or inflammatory markers may partially explain the previously reported relationship between sleep habits and cardiovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
