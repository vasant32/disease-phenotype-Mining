<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However there is widespread interest in high-fat ("Atkins Diet") and high-protein ("Zone Diet") alternatives to the conventional high-carbohydrate, high-fibre approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a randomised trial that compared these two alternative approaches with a conventional diet in overweight insulin-resistant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-six normoglycaemic, insulin-resistant women (BMI &gt;27 kg/m(2)) were randomised to one of three dietary interventions: a high-carbohydrate, high-fibre (HC) diet, the high-fat (HF) Atkins Diet, or the high-protein (HP) Zone Diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The experimental approach was designed to mimic what might be achieved in clinical practice: the recommendations involved advice concerning food choices and were not prescriptive in terms of total energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were supervised <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and weight maintenance phases (8 weeks each), but there was no contact between the research team and the participants during the final 8 weeks of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed in terms of body composition and indicators of cardiovascular and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Body weight, waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and insulin levels decreased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three diets but, apart from insulin, the reductions were significantly greater in the HF and HP groups than in the HC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the popular diets reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to a greater extent than the standard dietary advice did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When compared with the HC diet, the HF and HP diets were shown to produce significantly (p&lt;0.01) greater reductions in several parameters, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (HF -2.8 kg, HP -2.7 kg), waist circumference (HF -3.5 cm, HP -2.7 cm) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (HF -0.30 mmol/l, HP [corrected] -0.22 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> decreased in individuals on the HC and HP diets, but tended to fluctuate in those on the HF diet to the extent that overall levels were significantly lower in the HP group than in the HF group (-0.28 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.04-0.52, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those on the HF diet, 25% showed a &gt;10% increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, whereas this occurred in only 13% of subjects on the HC diet and 3% of those on the HP diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In routine practice a reduced-carbohydrate, higher protein diet may be the most appropriate overall approach to reducing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To achieve similar benefits on a HC diet, it may be necessary to increase fibre-rich wholegrains, legumes, vegetables and fruits, and to reduce <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> to a greater extent than appears to be achieved by implementing current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The HF approach appears successful for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in the short term, but <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels should be monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The potential deleterious effects of the diet in the long term remain a concern </plain></SENT>
