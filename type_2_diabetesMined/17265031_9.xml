<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SMMC-7721 hepatoma cells and C2C12 myotube cells were used to explore the role of SPHK1 in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KK/Ay type 2 diabetic mice, which were transfected with adenovirus harbouring the human SPHK1 gene by i.v. injection, were used to investigate the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects of SPHK1 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and the insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in both 7721 cells and C2C12 cells were markedly enhanced when SPHK1 was overexpressed by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, whereas they were substantially reduced when the expression of SPHK1 was inhibited or the activity of SPHK1 was blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin could activate SPHK1 of both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPHK1 gene delivery significantly reduced the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of KK/Ay diabetic mice, but had no effect on that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also attenuated elevated levels of plasma insulin, NEFA, triacylglycerol, cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, significantly ameliorated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>-induced injury of liver, heart and kidney, and enhanced phosphorylation of insulin-signalling kinases such as Akt and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3beta in livers of the diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: SPHK1 is involved in insulin signalling and plays an important role in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fat metabolism; adenovirus-mediated SPHK1 gene transfer might provide a novel strategy in the treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
