<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non protein <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">thiol groups</z:chebi> (NP-SH), AChE, Catalase (CAT) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> Dismutase (SOD) activities were measure in RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">Thiobarbituric Acid</z:chebi>-Reactive Substances (TBARS) levels and protein <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">thiol groups</z:chebi> (P-SH) were estimated in ghosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, P-SH and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">Vitamin C</z:chebi> (VIT C) were measure in plasma sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and AChE activities, besides TBARS levels were higher in erythrocytes of Type 2 DM, while SOD activity and NP-SH levels were decreased when compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ASc, in vitro, reduced <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and AChE activities and some parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed correlations between VIT C and P-SH levels, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity and P-SH levels, as well as NP-SH and TBARS levels in diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that ASc in vitro is able to promote the reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters, and act against biochemical changes occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
