<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) in connection with plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and plasminogen activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 565 T2DM patients were received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> (n=333) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi> (n=232) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed the level of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG), glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1C), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) state, plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) before and after a 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 weeks with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment, significant reductions were observed in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) and 2-h postprandial BG(PBG), HbA1C (from 8.60+/-3.10 to 7.10+/-1.60%) and HOMA-IR (from 4.11+/-0.85 to 2.42+/-0.91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) were significantly decreased, whereas that of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) was increased markedly with statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was an obvious improvement in t-PA activity (from 0.225+/-0.11 to 0.457+/-0.177IU/ml); whereas the PAI-1 activity was decreased significantly (from 0.898+/-0.168 to 0.533+/-0.215AU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed in plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profiles and plasminogen activity in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi> receiving group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> can rapidly and stably improve glycemic control and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism, significantly alleviate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and enhance fibrinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
