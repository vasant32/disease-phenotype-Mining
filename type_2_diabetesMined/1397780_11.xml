<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple independent data sources were used and the capture-recapture method was applied to estimate the completeness of ascertainment of the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary data source was the list of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients attending the diabetic clinic or those referred by family physicians and paediatricians of the area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary data sources were the list of hospital discharges, the prescriptions data source and the list of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> people using reagent strips and insulin syringes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On 1 October 1988 (the cut-off date) 2,069 cases of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated completeness of ascertainment of the survey was 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, Type 1 (insulin-dependent), Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) and insulin-treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were, respectively, 2.21% (95% CI 2.13-2.29), 0.80/1,000 (0.62-0.98) and 2.10% (2.01-2.19), 2.92/1,000 (2.57-3.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A higher prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed in women (2.30%, 2.18-2.42) than in men (1.88%, 1.76-2.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age-specific prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Computerized data sources routinely available in the Piedmont Region (hospital discharges and prescriptions data sources) showed a low completeness of ascertainment when considered together (65%, 1,338 of 2,069), indicating the need to involve the diabetic clinic and family physicians in the ascertainment of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the prevalence of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Italy was lower than in Northern Europe and the United States </plain></SENT>
