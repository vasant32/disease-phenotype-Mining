<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using 3T3-L1 adipocytes and oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified 142 known genes reproducibly upregulated by at least threefold after 4 h and/or 24 h of TNF-alpha treatment, and 78 known genes downregulated by at least twofold after 24 h of TNF-alpha incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha-induced genes include transcription factors implicated in preadipocyte gene expression or NF-kappaB activation, cytokines and cytokine-induced proteins, growth factors, enzymes, and signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, a number of adipocyte-abundant genes, including GLUT4, hormone sensitive lipase, long-chain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37554">fatty acyl-CoA</z:chebi> synthase, adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa, and transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha, receptor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> X receptor-alpha, and peroxisome profilerator-activated receptor gamma were significantly downregulated by TNF-alpha treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, 24-h exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to TNF-alpha resulted in reduced protein levels of GLUT4 and several insulin signaling proteins, including the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and protein kinase B (AKT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was activated within 15 min of TNF-alpha addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing IkappaBalpha-DN, a nondegradable NF-kappaB inhibitor, exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, global gene expression, and insulin responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, absence of NF-kappaB activation abolished suppression of &gt;98% of the genes normally suppressed by TNF-alpha and induction of 60-70% of the genes normally induced by TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, extensive cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in IkappaBalpha-DN-expressing adipocytes after 2 h of TNF-alpha treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus the changes in adipocyte gene expression induced by TNF-alpha could lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, NF-kappaB is an obligatory mediator of most of these TNF-alpha responses </plain></SENT>
