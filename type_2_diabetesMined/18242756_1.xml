<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effects of keishibukuryogan on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> metabolism in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five-week-old male OLETF rats were divided into three groups: diabetic control rats given a standard chow; diabetic rats given keishibukuryogan (3%, w/w in chow); diabetic rats given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (0.01%, w/w in chow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of keishibukuryogan produced significant improvement against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels, and the homeostasis index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> did not change by keishibukuryogan treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Against <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters, keishibukuryogan significantly lowered serum total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and the hepatic total cholesterol level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Keishibukuryogan treatment also significantly reduced the serum leptin level, but it had no effect on the serum adiponectin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, keishibukuryogan showed significant effects on epididymal adipose tissue by decreasing the size of fat cells and on skeletal muscle by reducing TNF-alpha protein content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these results, it was suggested that keishibukuryogan exerts beneficial effects on the features associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
