<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>What is more challenging is what to do when treatment goals are no longer being met despite adequate titration of basal insulin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addressing postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels can be accomplished by several approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Traditionally this has meant moving to basal bolus insulin, which is considered the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Premixed insulin may also be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data is also emerging for basal "plus" strategies, that is, incremental addition of prandial insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Newer approaches also reviewed in this article included premixed formulations containing ultra-long acting basal insulin with rapid-acting insulin analogs, inhaled insulin and insulin jet injectors, as well as the use of incretin-based therapies </plain></SENT>
