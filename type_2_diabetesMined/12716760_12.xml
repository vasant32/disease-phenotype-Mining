<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD36 is a receptor/transporter that binds fatty acids of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD36 deficiency has been linked with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is strong evidence of in vivo interaction between platelets and atherogenic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> suggesting that atherogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>, that are increased in diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> are important in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> binds to the platelet receptor CD36, enhances platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> production, and causes increased collagen-mediated platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> enhanced collagen-induced platelet aggregation by 1) shortening the time taken for aggregation to begin (lag time) to 70% of control (P = 0.001); 2) increasing maximum aggregation to 170% of control (P = 0.008); and 3) increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> production to 3,318% of control (P = 0.004), where control represents platelets stimulated with collagen (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody against CD36 attenuated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-enhanced collagen-induced platelet aggregation by 1) inhibiting binding of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> to platelets by 75% (P = 0.041); 2) lengthening lag time to 190% (P &lt; 0.001); and 3) decreasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> production to 8% of control (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In support of this finding, platelets from Cd36-deficient rats showed no increase in aggregation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> production, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> binding in contrast to platelets from rats expressing CD36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that platelet Cd36 has a key role in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-induced collagen-mediated platelet aggregation, possibly contributing to atherothrombosis associated with increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
