<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The glycation gap (the difference between measured A1C and the value predicted by regression on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>) is stable and is associated with microvascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but has not hitherto been estimated within a clinically useful time frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether two determinations 30 days apart suffice for a reasonably reliable estimate if both A1C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> exhibit stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 311 patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for whom simultaneous measurements of A1C and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> had been made on at least two occasions separated by 1 month (t(0) and t(1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycemia was deemed stable if A1C(t(1)) - A1C(t(0)) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>(t(1)) - <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>(t(0)) were both less than their reference change values (RCVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instantaneous glycation gaps [gg(t(0)) and gg(t(1))] and their mean (GG), were calculated using the data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stable patients for the required regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stable glycemia was shown by 144 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 90% of unstable case subjects, a change in medication was identified as the cause of instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 129 stable patients with an average of eight gg determinations prior to t(0), GG correlated closely with the mean of these prior determinations (r(2) = 0.902, slope 1.025, intercept -0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The glycation gap can be calculated reliably from pairs of A1C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> measurements taken 1 month apart if these measurements satisfy the RCV criteria for glycemic control </plain></SENT>
