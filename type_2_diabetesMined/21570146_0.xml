<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adults with non-insulin treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited and randomized into three groups: Group A, self-monitoring with a quantitative urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> meter (n = 38); Group B, self monitoring with a blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> meter (n=35); Group C, the control group without self monitoring (n=35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up for six months, during which identical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care was provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in HbA1c within each group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the study conclusion, mean changes in HbA1c from baseline were -1.9% for Group A, -1.5% for Group B and -1.0% for Group C, and the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c â‰¤ 6.5% were 38.9%, 35.3% and 20.0% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences between the groups were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average monitoring frequency was significantly higher in Group A than in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and quality of life scores were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that self-monitoring of urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> has comparable efficacy on glycaemic control, and facilitates better compliance than blood self monitoring, without influencing the quality of life or risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
