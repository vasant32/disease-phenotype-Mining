<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First-degree relatives of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the evolution of insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance over 7 years in 33 nondiabetic, first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic individuals using frequently sampled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>-modified intravenous and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects gained weight, and their waist circumference increased (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when we accounted for the modulating effect of insulin sensitivity on insulin release, beta-cell function determined as the disposition index decreased by 22% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This decrease was associated with declines in intravenous and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at the first assessment, we compared those who progressed to IGT with those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disposition index was 50% lower in the progressors than in the nonprogressors at follow-up (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The decline in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance over time in first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic individuals is strongly related to the loss of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, early interventions to slow the decline in beta-cell function should be considered in high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
