<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A variable expansion of a GAA repeat is present in the first intron of the frataxin gene, also termed FRDA1 or X25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long repeat lengths (&gt;66 repeats) are present in patients with Friedreich's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, while an intermediate expansion (10-66 repeats) has recently been reported to be highly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay, we found that 32.4% (95%CI 29.9-34.9) of 636 Danish Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients were carriers of an intermediate expansion, whereas the frequency was 30.4% (26.4-34.4) among 224 matched <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant control subjects (P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control subjects, the values of serum insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test were similar between the 69 carriers and 155 noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated a possible relationship between expansions of the FRDA1 gene and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced beta-cell function in 338 young Caucasians (33.7% [30.1-37.3] carriers) and in 215 glucose-tolerant subjects (31.0% [26.6-35.4] carriers) with a type 2 diabetic parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In neither population did the carriers differ from noncarriers according to values of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> serum insulin, or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses after intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intermediate expansion of the frataxin trinucleotide repeat is not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion in Danish Caucasians </plain></SENT>
