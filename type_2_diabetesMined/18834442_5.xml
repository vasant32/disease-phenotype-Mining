<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many signals and pathways have been implicated in beta-cell function, proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The co-ordinated regulation of functional beta-cell mass by insulin signalling and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism under HF diet-induced insulin-resistant conditions is discussed in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 is one of the two major substrates for the insulin signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, IRS-2 is involved in the regulation of beta-cell proliferation, as has been demonstrated using knockout mice models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in an animal model for human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> because of insufficiency of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, decreased beta-cell proliferation was observed in mice with beta-cell-specific glucokinase haploinsufficiency (Gck(+/) (-)) fed a HF diet without upregulation of IRS-2 in beta-cells, which was reversed by overexpression of IRS-2 in beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As to the mechanism underlying the upregulation of IRS-2 in beta-cells, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism plays an important role independently of insulin, and phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein triggered by calcium-dependent signalling is the critical pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Downstream from insulin signalling via IRS-2 in beta-cells, a reduction in FoxO1 nuclear exclusion contributes to the insufficient proliferative response of beta-cells to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that IRS-2 is critical for beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in response to HF diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
