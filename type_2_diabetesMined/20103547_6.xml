<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a 4-year, two-armed, multicenter controlled trial in 13 hospital-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics in Italy (current controlled trials no. ISRCTN19509463) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 815 non-insulin-treated patients aged &lt;80 years with &gt; or =1 year known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration were randomized to either group or individual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 4 years, patients in group care had lower A1C, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) than control subjects receiving individual care, despite similar pharmacological prescriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Health behaviors, quality of life, and knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had become better in group care patients than in control subjects (P &lt; 0.001, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The favorable clinical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes of group care can be reproduced in different clinical settings </plain></SENT>
