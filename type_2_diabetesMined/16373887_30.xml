<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Glycemic Optimization with Algorithms and Labs at Point of Care (GOAL A1C) study was a 24-week, randomized, parallel-group, four-arm, open-label study of 7,893 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> uncontrolled by oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents and requiring insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned by investigators from 2,164 sites in the U.S. to insulin glargine with either 1) usual (no unsolicited contact between visits) insulin titration using a simple algorithm with laboratory A1C testing, 2) usual titration with POC A1C testing, 3) active (weekly monitored) titration with laboratory A1C testing, or 4) active titration with POC A1C testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included a change in A1C and fasting self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) levels, percentage of patients achieving A1C &lt;7.0%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant A1C and SMBG reductions were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arms (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with usual insulin titration, active titration achieved greater A1C reduction (1.5 vs. 1.3%; P &lt; 0.0001), SMBG reduction (88 vs. 79 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.0001), and proportion of patients achieving A1C &lt;7.0% (38 vs. 30%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients receiving active titration, POC A1C testing was associated with an increase in the proportion achieving an A1C &lt;7.0% (41% for POC vs. 36% for laboratory; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates were low (usual vs. active groups: 3.7 vs. 6.0 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confirmed episodes/patient-year [P &lt; 0.001]; 0.09 vs. 0.14 severe episodes/patient-year [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a predominantly primary care setting, addition of insulin glargine using a simple algorithm achieved significant improvements in glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four study arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Active titration resulted in significant incremental improvements in glycemic control, and, among patients receiving active titration, POC A1C testing resulted in a greater portion achieving A1C &lt;7.0% </plain></SENT>
