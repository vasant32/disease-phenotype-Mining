<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were measured in islets by quantitative PCR and in pancreatic beta cells obtained by laser capture microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, plasma hormone levels and islet hormone secretion were analysed in C57BL/6 Pask homozygote knockout mice (Pask-/-) and control littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alpha-TC1-9 cells, human islets or cultured E13.5 rat pancreatic epithelia were transduced with anti-Pask or control small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, or with adenoviruses encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein or PASK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PASK expression was significantly lower in islets from human type 2 diabetic than control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PASK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was present in alpha and beta cells from mouse islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Pask-/- mice, fasted blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma glucagon levels were 25 ± 5% and 50 ± 8% (mean ± SE) higher, respectively, than in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At inhibitory <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (10 mmol/l), islets from Pask-/- mice secreted 2.04 ± 0.2-fold (p &lt; 0.01) more glucagon and 2.63 ± 0.3-fold (p &lt; 0.01) less insulin than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> failed to inhibit glucagon secretion from PASK-depleted alpha-TC1-9 cells, whereas PASK overexpression inhibited glucagon secretion from these cells and human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extracellular insulin (20 nmol/l) inhibited glucagon secretion from control and PASK-deficient alpha-TC1-9 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PASK-depleted alpha-TC1-9 cells and pancreatic embryonic explants displayed increased expression of the preproglucagon (Gcg) and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-alpha2 (Prkaa2) genes, implying a possible role for AMPK-alpha2 downstream of PASK in the control of glucagon gene expression and release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: PASK is involved in the regulation of glucagon secretion by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and may be a useful target for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
