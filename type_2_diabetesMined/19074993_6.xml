<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Abnormal small nerve fiber function may be an early feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> and may also underlie painful symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods for assessing small-fiber damage include quantitative sensory testing (QST) and determining intraepidermal nerve fiber density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently described a reproducible physiological technique, the LDIflare, which assesses small-fiber function and thus may reflect early dysfunction before structural damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The value of this technique in painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was assessed by comparing it with QST and dermal nerve fiber density (NFD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen healthy control subjects, 10 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (PFN), and 12 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and painless <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (PLN) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LDIflare and QST were performed on the dorsum of the foot, and dermal NFD was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results of both large- and small-fiber quantitative sensory tests were abnormal in patients with PLN but not those with PFN compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dermal NFD was also significantly reduced in the PLN group compared with control subjects (205.8 +/- 165.3 vs. 424.9 +/- 176.3 [mean +/- SD]; P = 0.003) but not in the PFN group (307.6 +/- 164.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the LDIflare (square centimeters) was reduced in both PFN (1.59 +/- 0.41) and PLN (1.51 +/- 0.56) groups compared with control subjects (4.38 +/- 1.4) (P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NFD correlated significantly with the LDIflare (r = 0.57, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The LDIflare demonstrated impaired small-fiber function in patients with PFN when other assessments revealed no abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We believe that this method has potential diagnostic value, particularly because it is noninvasive, has excellent reproducibility, and correlates with NFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it may have an important role in assessing preventative therapies in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
