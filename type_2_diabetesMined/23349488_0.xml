<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identity and function of the causal genes in these susceptibility loci remain, however, elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HHEX/IDE T2D locus is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> in response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have assessed β-cell function in Ide knock-out (KO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is decreased in Ide KO mice due to impaired replenishment of the releasable pool of granules and that the Ide gene is haploinsufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that autophagic flux and microtubule content is reduced in β-cells of Ide KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One important cellular role for IDE involves the neutralization of amyloidogenic proteins and we find that α-synuclein and IDE levels are inversely correlated in β-cells of Ide KO mice and T2D patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we provide evidence that both gain- and loss-of-function of α-synuclein in β-cells in vivo not only impair GSIS but also autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these data identify the Ide gene as a regulator of GSIS, suggest a molecular mechanism for β-cell degeneration as a consequence of Ide deficiency, and additionally corroborates and extends a previously established important role for α-synuclein in β-cell function </plain></SENT>
