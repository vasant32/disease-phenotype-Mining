<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Overweight, middle-aged men (n=172) and women (n=350) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> were randomised to receive either 'standard care' (control) or intensive dietary and exercise counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline and annual examinations included assessment of dietary intake with 3-day food records and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status by repeated 75-g OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For these analyses the treatment groups were combined and only subjects with follow-up data (n=500) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individuals with low fat (&lt;median) and high fibre (&gt;median) intakes lost more weight compared with those consuming a high-fat (&gt;median), low-fibre (&lt;median) diet (3.1 vs 0.7 kg after 3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In separate models, hazard ratios for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence during a mean follow-up of 4.1 years were (highest compared with lowest quartile) 0.38 (95% CI 0.19-0.77) for fibre intake, 2.14 (95% CI 1.16-3.92) for fat intake, and 1.73 (95% CI 0.89-3.38) for saturated-fat intake, after adjustment for sex, intervention assignment, weight and weight change, physical activity, baseline 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and intake of the nutrient being investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the low-fat/high-fibre category, hazard ratios were 1.98 (95% CI 0.98-4.02), 2.68 (95% CI 1.40-5.10), and 1.89 (95% CI 1.09-3.30) for low-fat/low-fibre, high-fat/high-fibre, and high-fat/low-fibre, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Dietary fat and fibre intake are significant predictors of sustained weight reduction and progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk subjects, even after adjustment for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
