<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, however, little direct evidence in vivo for a causative role of IL-6 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, a 5-day constant subcutaneous infusion of hIL-6 before portal vein insulin challenge resulted in impairment of early insulin receptor signaling in the liver of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the sixfold elevation of IL-6 attained with constant infusion was similar to levels reached in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with an hepatic response to IL-6, STAT3 phosphorylation was increased in livers of IL-6-treated mice at 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> infusion of IL-6 also reduced hepatic insulin receptor autophosphorylation by 60% and tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates-1 and -2 by 60 and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-6 had no effect on the mass of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-6 also decreased refeeding-dependent glucokinase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> induction by approximately 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin tolerance tests revealed reduced insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to hepatic insulin receptor signal transduction, 5-day IL-6 exposure failed to suppress skeletal muscle insulin receptor signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IL-6 treatment selectively impairs hepatic insulin signaling in vivo, further supporting a role for IL-6 in hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
