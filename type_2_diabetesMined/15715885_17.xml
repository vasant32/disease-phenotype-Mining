<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Throughout the last decade, molecular genetic studies of non-autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> have contributed significantly to our present understanding of this disease's complex aetiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monogenic forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo>, MODY) have been identified and classified into MODY1-6 according to the mutated genes that by being expressed in the pancreatic beta-cells confirm at the molecular level the clinical presentation of MODY as a predominantly insulin secretory deficient form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomewide linkage studies of presumed polygenic type 2 diabetic populations indicate that loci on chromosomes 1q, 5q, 8p, 10q, 12q and 20q contain susceptibility genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Yet, so far, the only susceptibility gene, calpain-10 (CAPN10), which has been identified using genomewide linkage studies, is located on chromosome 2q37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation analyses of selected 'candidate' susceptibility genes in various populations have also identified the widespread Pro12Ala variant of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and the common Glu23Lys variant of the ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel, Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These variants may contribute significantly to the risk type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> conferring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of liver, muscle and fat (Pro12Ala) and a relative insulin secretory deficiency (Glu23Lys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is likely that, in the near future, the recent more detailed knowledge of the human genome and insights into its haploblocks together with the developments of high-throughput and cheap genotyping will facilitate the discovery of many more type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> gene variants in study materials, which are statistically powered and phenotypically well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of these efforts are likely to be the platform for major progress in the development of personalized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs with higher efficacy and few side effects </plain></SENT>
