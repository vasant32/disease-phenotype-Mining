<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, which inhibit the K(ATP) channel, are used to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rare activating mutations cause neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas the common variants, E23K in KCNJ11 and S1369A in ABCC8, are in strong linkage disequilibrium, constituting a haplotype that predisposes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date it has not been possible to establish which of these represents the etiological variant, and functional studies are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there have been no studies of the S1369A variant or the combined effect of the two on K(ATP) channel function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patch-clamp technique was used to study the nucleotide sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> inhibition of recombinant human K(ATP) channels containing either the K23/A1369 or E23/S1369 variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ATP sensitivity of the K(ATP) channel was decreased in the K23/A1369 variant (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 8.0 vs. 2.5 mumol/l for the E23/S1369 variant), although there was no difference in <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The K23/A1369 variant also displayed increased inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>, an A-site <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> drug (IC(50) = 52.7 vs. 188.7 nmol/l for the E23/S1369 variant), but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (AB site) or repaglinide (B site) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the common K23/A1369 variant K(ATP) channel displays decreased ATP inhibition that may contribute to the observed increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the increased sensitivity of the K23/A1369 variant to the A-site <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> may provide a pharmacogenomic therapeutic approach for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are homozygous for both risk alleles </plain></SENT>
