<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated total skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> fatty acid content in participants exhibiting a wide range of insulin sensitivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The middle-aged male participants (n=33) were matched for lean body mass and divided into four groups: type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D, n=8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT, n=9), healthy controls (CON, n=8) and endurance-trained (TR, n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A two step (28 and 80 mU m(-2) min(-1)) sequential euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp was performed for 120 and 90 min for step 1 and step 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies were obtained from vastus lateralis at baseline, and after steps 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates increased in response to insulin infusion, and significant differences were present between groups (T2D&lt;IGT&lt;CON&lt;TR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content was 108+/-7, 95+/-6, 126+/-12 and 156+/-25 nmol total <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> fatty acids/g wet weight of tissue in the T2D, IGT, CON and TR groups, respectively, and muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content was higher (p&lt;0.01) in the TR than the IGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content was not influenced by insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a positive correlation (r=0.42, p&lt;0.05) was present between muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content at baseline and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Total muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content was similar between individuals showing marked differences in insulin sensitivity, and therefore does not seem to be a major factor in muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aerobic capacity does not appear to influence muscle <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
