<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively followed 42,504 male participants of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were aged 40-75 years and free of diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diet was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire and updated in 1990 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During 12 years of follow-up, we ascertained 1,321 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intakes of total fat (multivariate RR for extreme quintiles 1.27, CI 1.04-1.55, P for trend=0.02) and saturated fat (1.34, 1.09-1.66, P for trend=0.01) were associated with a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these associations disappeared after additional adjustment for BMI (total fat RR 0.97, CI 0.79-1.18; saturated fat 0.97, 0.79-1.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intakes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi>, trans-fat, long-chain n-3 fat, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> were not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk after multivariate adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">Linoleic acid</z:chebi> was associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men &lt;65 years of age (RR 0.74, CI 0.60-0.92, P for trend=0.01) and in men with a BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2) (0.53, 0.33-0.85, P for trend=0.006) but not in older and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequent consumption of processed meat was associated with a higher risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR 1.46, CI 1.14-1.86 for &gt; or = 5/week vs. &lt;1/month, P for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total and saturated fat intake were associated with a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but these associations were not independent of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequent consumption of processed meats may increase risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
