<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination may be more effective because each treatment stimulates <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase activity in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of exercise training plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on insulin sensitivity in men and women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e>, compared with each treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For 12 weeks, men and women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> were assigned to the following groups: placebo (P), 2,000 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (M), exercise training with placebo (EP), or exercise training with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (EM) (n = 8 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before and after the intervention, insulin sensitivity was measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (80 mU/m(2)/min) clamp enriched with [6,6-(2)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes due to intervention were compared across groups by repeated-measures ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three interventions <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) relative to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean rise was 25-30% higher after EP than after either EM or M, but this difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin sensitivity was considerably higher after 12 weeks of exercise training and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in men and women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subtle differences among condition means suggest that adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> blunted the full effect of exercise training </plain></SENT>
