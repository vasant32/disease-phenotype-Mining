<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Some evidence suggests an inverse association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in men and a positive association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this community-based study was to evaluate sex differences in the association between endogenous total and bioavailable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included in this study 775 men and 633 postmenopausal non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-using women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> &gt; or =55 years of age (mean ages 72 and 75 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) was administered to fasting subjects from 1984 to 1987, when sera were frozen for measurement of total and bioavailable hormone levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and bioavailable hormone levels were determined using a modified <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> precipitation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between steroid hormones and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In sex-specific age- and BMI-adjusted analyses, men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) had significantly lower total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women with IGT or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly higher bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and total and bioavailable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were inversely associated in men (P = 0.0001), whereas bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> were positively associated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in women (P = 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies are needed to further develop the hormone-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> connection </plain></SENT>
