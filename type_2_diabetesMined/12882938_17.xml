<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported the susceptibility loci contributing to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related phenotypes in KK/Ta mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused on expression in the kidneys and liver of KK/Ta and BALB/c mice using differential display (DD) PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Zn-alpha(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 (Azgp1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were increased in the kidneys and liver in KK/Ta mice, and sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the relationship between this polymorphism and various phenotypes in 208 KK/Ta x (BALB/c x KK/Ta) F1 backcross mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis revealed that Azgp1 and D17Mit218 exhibit a suggestive linkage to body weight (8 weeks) (logarithm of odds 2.3 and 2.9, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderate gene-gene interactions were observed at these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in 3T3-L1 cells transfected with the expression pcDNA 3.1 vector containing Azgp1 coding sequence of KK/Ta mice were significantly higher than those of BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Azgp1 is a possible candidate gene for regulation of body weight, elucidation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010982'>polygenic inheritance</z:hpo>, and age-dependent changes in the genetic control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
