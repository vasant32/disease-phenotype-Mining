<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Results from in vitro studies suggest that selected fatty acids, and especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> (LA), can elicit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> (ED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because LA is increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> subfractions in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, this alteration may contribute to ED associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lectin-like oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor-1 (LOX-1) is the major endothelial receptor for oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (oxLDL), and uptake of oxLDL through LOX-1 induces ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether LA may contribute to the upregulation of endothelial LOX-1 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we studied the effect of LA on LOX-1 expression in cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HAECs with LA increased, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, endothelial LOX-1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of HAECs with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> and inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase, protein kinase C (PKC), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibited the stimulatory effect of LA on LOX-1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in LA-treated HAECs, increased expression of classic PKC isoforms was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LA also led to a significant increase in LOX-1 gene expression and enhanced the binding of nuclear proteins extracted from HAECs to the NF-kappaB regulatory element of the LOX-1 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, LA enhanced, through LOX-1, oxLDL uptake by endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results demonstrate that LA enhances endothelial LOX-1 expression through <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-sensitive and PKC-dependent pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect seems to be exerted at the transcriptional level and to involve the activation of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of LOX-1 by LA may contribute to ED associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
