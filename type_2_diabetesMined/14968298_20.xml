<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the influence of non-esterified fatty acids, with or without concomitant increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, on human islet function and on the expression of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human islets isolated from non-diabetic and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> donors were cultured with 5.5, 16 or 30 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and when appropriate with 1 or 2 mmol/l non-esterified fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 48 h, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin content, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content and expression of different genes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-esterified fatty acids decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin content and increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content of human isolated islets, independently from the deleterious effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations also decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content, but had no influence on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion of islets appeared to be significantly correlated with their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and non-esterified fatty acids modified the gene expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyltransferase-I, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> oxidase and uncoupling protein 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: In our model of isolated human islets, increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and non-esterified fatty acids separately reproduced the two major beta-cell alterations observed in vivo, i.e. loss of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion and reduction in islet insulin content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggest that this deleterious effect was, at least in part, mediated by modifications in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism gene expression </plain></SENT>
