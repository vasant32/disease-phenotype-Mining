<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects were divided by the degree of their average weekly alcohol consumption into three groups: nondrinkers, light drinkers (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption &lt;210 g/week), and heavy drinkers (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption &gt; or = 210 g/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of atherosclerotic progression was evaluated using aortic pulse wave velocity (a-PWV), and possible atherosclerotic risks were evaluated using known atherosclerotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: a-PWV was significantly lower in light drinkers than in nondrinkers and heavy drinkers, but there was no significant difference in a-PWV between nondrinkers and heavy drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in heavy drinkers than in nondrinkers and light drinkers, whereas there was no significant difference in these levels between nondrinkers and light drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean levels of BMI and blood HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and fibrinogen were not different between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant positive correlations of a-PWV with age and systolic blood pressure and weak but significant negative correlations of a-PWV with alcohol consumption and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Light drinking, but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy drinking</z:e>, has preventive effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The known beneficial effects of drinking alcohol on blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and fibrinogen may not be involved in the preventive effect of light drinking on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
