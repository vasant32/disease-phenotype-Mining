<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 1,142 subjects were from the population-based Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men cohort study (see http://www.pubcare.uu.se/ULSAM/, last accessed in May 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp; fasting intact and 32-33 split proinsulin, immunoreactive insulin and specific insulin were measured in plasma samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372 were genotyped using a fluorescent homogeneous single base extension assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SNP genotypes were analysed against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence at age 70 using logistic regression and against quantitative biochemical measures using linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We replicated the association with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> for both SNPs in this cohort of elderly males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest significant odds ratio (2.15, 95% CI 1.20-3.85) was found for SNP rs7903146 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for SNP rs12255372 was 1.69 (95% CI 1.20-2.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both TCF7L2 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with plasma proinsulin when adjusting for insulin sensitivity, both in the whole cohort and when the diabetic subjects were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis for fasting plasma insulin or insulin sensitivity did not give significant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The association between the risk alleles of the two SNPs studied and levels of proinsulin in plasma, identified when adjusting for insulin sensitivity using euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp measurements in this study, is an important novel finding </plain></SENT>
