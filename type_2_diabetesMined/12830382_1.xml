<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 50% reduction in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations was achieved by intravenous administration of a rapidly acting insulin (15 IU/kg body weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flows were measured by a non-radioactive microsphere technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A pronounced decrease in islet blood flow was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, but preferentially in the Type 2 diabetic GK rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When a similar dose of insulin was given to whole-pancreas transplanted rats only islet blood flow in the native pancreas was decreased, whereas that of the transplanted, i.e. denervated, pancreas was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">2-deoxy-D-glucose</z:chebi>, which induces intracellular glucopenia especially in neurons, also decreased islet blood flow despite a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> leads to a preferential decrease in pancreatic-islet blood perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect is probably mediated by the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">2-deoxy D-glucose</z:chebi>-induced neuronal glucopenia caused a similar decrease in blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of islet blood flow are not likely to be mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> stimulation of the adrenal glands, with an associated release of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, because the transplanted pancreas was not affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decreased islet blood perfusion could possibly diminish the output of insulin from the islets, thereby preventing a further decrease in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
