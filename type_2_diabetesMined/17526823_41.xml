<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of their uses is to allow the projection of short-term data from clinical trials to evaluate clinical outcomes and costs over a long-term period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This technology is becoming increasingly important to assist decision making in modern medicine in situations where there is a paucity of long-term clinical trial data, as recently acknowledged in the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association Consensus Panel Guidelines for Computer Modeling of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and its Complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Mount Hood Challenge Meetings provide a forum for computer modelers of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to discuss and compare models and identify key areas of future development to advance the field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Fourth Mount Hood Challenge in 2004 was the first meeting of its kind to ask modelers to perform simulations of outcomes for patients in published clinical trials, allowing comparison against "real life" data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight modeling groups participated in the challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each group was given three of the following challenges: to simulate a trial of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (CARDS [Collaborative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study]); to simulate a trial of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DCCT [<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Complications Trial]); and to calculate outcomes for a hypothetical, precisely specified patient (cross-model validation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the models varied from each other and for methodological reasons, in some cases, from the published trial data in important ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach of performing systematic comparisons and validation exercises has enabled the identification of key differences among the models, as well as their possible causes and directions for improvement in the future </plain></SENT>
