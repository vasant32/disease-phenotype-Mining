<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 233 first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) with no history of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormalities and their 190 spouses, who did not have a family history of T2D, underwent a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based upon the OGTT, these two groups were further divided into three subgroups, including groups with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (IGR), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) was evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR), beta-cell function indices of basal and first-phase were measured by DI1 (HOMA-beta/HOMA-IR) and DI2 (DeltaI30/DeltaG30/HOMA-IR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the first-degree relatives and their spouses, the HOMA-IR was highest in the T2D group and lowest in the NGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the HOMA-beta, DI1 and DI2 declined significantly with progressive reductions in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (P&lt;0.01 or 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DI1 and DI2 of the NGT group of first-degree relatives (FNGT) were significantly lower than those of the spouse NGT (SNGT) group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DI1 and DI2 of the IGR of first-degree relatives (FIGR) group were significantly lower than those of the spouse IGR (SIGR) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Defects in pancreatic beta-cell function exist in the first-degree relatives, who have different <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance statuses, of T2D patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These defects are more profound in FNGT and FIGR when compared to their spouses in corresponding <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there is no difference in IR between the corresponding <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance subgroups of the first-degree relatives and their spouses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It suggests that the genetic factor possibly aggravates beta-cell lesion </plain></SENT>
