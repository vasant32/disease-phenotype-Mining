<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linagliptin in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After screening and a 14-day washout, subjects received linagliptin 2.5, 5 or 10 mg or placebo once-daily for 28 days in this randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled within-dose groups study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients entered the study (linagliptin: 61; placebo: 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients withdrew prematurely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was little evidence of linagliptin accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure, maximum and trough plasma concentrations of linagliptin increased less than dose-proportionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rapid and sustained inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 reached 91-93% across linagliptin doses at steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the 24-h dosing interval, inhibition was still high (82-90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were marked increases in plasma glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 after 28 days of dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to placebo, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> linagliptin doses resulted in statistically significant decreases of the area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve following a meal tolerance test on day 29, that is, 24 h after the last study drug intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 28 days of treatment with linagliptin the placebo-corrected mean change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) (median baseline 7.0%) was -0.31% (2.5-mg dose), -0.37% (5-mg dose) and -0.28% (10-mg dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of adverse events was similar for linagliptin (31%) and placebo (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no notable safety concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Linagliptin administration led to attenuation of postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions and, despite a low HbA1c at baseline, statistically significant reductions in HbA1c after only 4 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin had a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
