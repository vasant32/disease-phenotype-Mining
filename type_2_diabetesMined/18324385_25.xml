<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate whether the polymorphism is related to altered insulin release in response to intravenous and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loads in non-diabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped SLC30A8 rs13266634 in 846 non-diabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic patients from five different white populations: Danish (n = 271), Finnish (n = 217), German (n = 149), Italian (n = 109) and Swedish (n = 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were subjected to both IVGTTs and OGTTs, and measurements of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Homozygous carriers of the major type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> C risk-allele showed a 19% decrease in first-phase insulin release (0-10 min) measured during the IVGTT (CC 3,624 +/- 3,197; CT 3,763 +/- 2,674; TT 4,478 +/- 3,032 pmol l(-1) min(-1), mean +/- SD; p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no significant genotype effect on insulin release measured during the OGTT or on estimates of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Of European non-diabetic offspring of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, 46% are homozygous carriers of the Arg325Trp polymorphism in ZnT-8, which is known to associate with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-prone offspring are characterised by a 19% decrease in first-phase insulin release following an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, suggesting a role for this variant in the pathogenesis of pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
