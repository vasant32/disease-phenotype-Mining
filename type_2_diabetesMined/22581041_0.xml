<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying this association is not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to gain greater insight into the possible mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used microarray technology to identify and examine changes in gene expression in the hippocampus of a murine model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the db/db mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics approaches were then used to investigate the biological significance of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To validate the biological significance we evaluated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 8 and 24 weeks, 256 and 822 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed in the db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most significantly enriched biological functions were related to mitochondria, heat shock proteins, or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the majority of which were downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ER-enriched cluster was one of the clusters that contained the highest number of differentially expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several of the downregulated genes that were differentially expressed at 24 but not at 8 weeks are directly involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and include two heat shock proteins (encoded by Hspa5 and Hsp90b1), a transcriptional factor (x-box binding protein 1, encoded by Xbp1), and an apoptotic mediator (DNA-damage inducible transcript 3, encoded by Ddit3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The changes that we observed in the UPR pathway due to ER stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this study are a foundation for the development of pharmacological targets to reduce ER stress in diabetic hippocampi </plain></SENT>
