<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> is highly prevalent in Mexico, we screened the ABCA1 coding sequence in Mexican individuals with low and <z:mp ids='MP_0001556'>high HDL cholesterol levels</z:mp> to seek functional variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A highly frequent nonsynonymous variant (R230C) was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low-HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> but not in high-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> individuals (P = 0.00006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We thus assessed its frequency in the Mexican-Mestizo general population, seeking possible associations with several metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>R230C was screened in 429 Mexican Mestizos using Taqman assays, and it was found in 20.1% of these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variant was significantly associated not only with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>decreased HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I levels but also with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (odds ratio 2.527, P = 0.005), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (1.893, P = 0.0007), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4.527, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first study reporting the association of an ABCA1 variant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related comorbidities as being epidemiologically relevant in the Mexican population </plain></SENT>
