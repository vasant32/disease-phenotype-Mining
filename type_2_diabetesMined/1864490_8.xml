<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic data suggest that having a parent with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> increases the risk for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in siblings of a Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase in risk is consistent with a shared genetic susceptibility between Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We contrast genetic risk factors in three sets of families, consisting of (1) a single Type 1 diabetic child (proband) and non-diabetic parents, (2) multiple Type 1 diabetic siblings and non-diabetic parents, and (3) at least one Type 1 diabetic child and at least one Type 2 diabetic parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that HLA region genes, which elevate the risk in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, have no significant effect with respect to the risk for developing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An earlier report cited a contribution by the haptoglobin locus to genetic susceptibility for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that a high risk HLA antigen (HLA-DR3) is decreased to a greater extent in Type 1 patients with a Type 2 parent than in Type 1 patients in which the parents are not diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of HLA-DR4 is maintained in these families, with an unexpectedly significant increased rate of transmission of the HLA-DR4 allele from Type 2 parent to Type 1 offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of haptoglobin in these families does not appear to be important, either with respect to association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or with respect to linkage with a secondary susceptibility locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that families with a Type 2 parent and Type 1 child, heavily determined by HLA-DR4 linked factors, may represent a homogeneous subset of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
