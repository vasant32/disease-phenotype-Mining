<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isocaloric refeeding on a high-fat diet resulted in even lower energy expenditure and thermogenesis and increased fat deposition and led to even higher plasma insulin and elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
