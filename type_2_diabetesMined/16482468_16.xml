<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cultured myotubes were obtained from muscle biopsies of 11 lean, healthy control subjects and ten patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of LXR isoforms and lipogenic genes were estimated by RT-quantitative PCR, and the effects of LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> on insulin action were evaluated by assays of protein kinase B serine 473 phosphorylation and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both LXRalpha and LXRbeta were expressed in human skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and there was no difference in their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance in tissues from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cultured muscle cells, LXR activation by T0901317 strongly increased expression of the genes encoding lipogenic enzymes, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty acid synthase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">stearoyl-CoA</z:chebi> desaturase 1, and also promoted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation in the presence of a high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism did not affect protein kinase B activation by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> did not modify insulin action in muscle cells from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may lead to increased utilisation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in muscle cells without affecting the mechanism of action of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term consequences of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation in muscle should be evaluated before the development of effective LXR-based therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
