<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An epidemiological population-based study of 1137 Danish patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> newly diagnosed by general practitioners (GPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GPs and patients together filled in a questionnaire about typical symptoms, signs and complications preceding the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormal thirst, <z:mp ids='MP_0011535'>frequent urination</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itching</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, visual disturbances, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> and (in men) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">balanitis</z:e> were associated with glycaemic level irrespective of age, sex, BMI, BP, complications and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent of the patients presented with one or more of these hyperglycaemic symptoms and signs, and the pre-diagnostic duration was typically less than 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only a few symptoms, signs and complications were associated with weight and BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients newly diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in family practice, typical diabetic symptoms, signs and complications are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Typical diabetic symptoms and signs are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pre-diagnostic duration of hyperglycaemic symptoms and signs were typically short, thus questioning the feasibility of early detection relying on increased anticipatory care by GPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, elevated levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and longer pre-diagnostic duration of cardiovascular complications suggest these might have a central role in an early diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
