<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that early vascular changes are already present at the time of diagnosis of MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship of different measures of early vascular impairment with body fat distribution and the natural progression of MetS was examined in newly diagnosed subjects non-pharmacologically treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 246 consecutively enrolled subjects were categorized according to the presence of MetS and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra-renal Doppler flow was used to ascertain resistive (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indices as markers of vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), cutis-rectis (CR) and rectis-aorta (RA) thicknesses were measured by ultrasonography; RA/CR ratio was used as measure of body fat distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pro-inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein, oxidative markers insulin and adiponectin blood concentrations were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics demonstrated increasing trends in biochemical, inflammatory, and oxidative parameters from MetS-, MetS+, to MetS+/T2D (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, the same increasing trends across the groups were observed in both sexes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (p&lt;0.001), RI (p&lt;0.001) and PI (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> correlated with RI (r=0.25; p&lt;0.001), PI (r=0.26; p&lt;0.001), and RA/CR ratio (r=0.43; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and intra-renal resistances are elevated at an early stage in MetS and are associated with a dysregulated production of fat-derived hormones and cytokines </plain></SENT>
