<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dosing protocols of NN414 of 3 weeks' duration were compared with appropriate vehicle-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first group, rats received NN414 (continued group; 1.5 mg/kg p.o. twice daily), during which an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) (on day 19 of dosing) was performed and insulin secretion from an in situ perfused pancreas preparation (on day 21) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second group received NN414 (discontinued group; same dose), but active treatment was replaced by vehicle treatment 2 days before the OGTT and for a further 2 days before the perfused pancreas study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly reduced by NN414, with the fall averaging 0.64 mmol/l after 3 weeks of treatment (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretory responsiveness to a step increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from 4.4 to 16.6 mmol/l, calculated relative to basal, was significantly improved in the continued group versus vehicle (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, administration of NN414 for 3 weeks in VDF rats reduces basal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, and reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> during an OGTT and improves insulin secretory responsiveness ex vivo </plain></SENT>
