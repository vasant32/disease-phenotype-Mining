<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different studies have shown that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) is associated with antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects in addition to a cholesterol-lowering effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the effect of pravastatin (40 mg/day) on coagulation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an open, randomized, crossover study designed with an 8-week intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study group was comprised of 50 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (median HbA(1c) 7.1%) and serum total cholesterol of 5-10 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated plasma levels of fibrinogen, F1 + 2, D-dimer, soluble tissue factor (sTF), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> Factor antigen (vWFag), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood samples drawn after fasting on day 1 and after 8 and 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reductions of total cholesterol (-22%; P &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (-32%; P &lt; 0.001), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (-10%; P &lt; 0.05) were achieved after 8 weeks of treatment with pravastatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, significant reductions of plasma levels of F1 + 2 (-4.4%; P &lt; 0.05), vWFag (-5.3%; P &lt; 0.05), and sTF (-3.4%; P &lt; 0.05) were observed after treatment with pravastatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, plasma levels of CRP were also significantly reduced (-13%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer did not decrease after treatment with pravastatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that pravastatin reduces levels of coagulation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> could play a role in reducing cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
