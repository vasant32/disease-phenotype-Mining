<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to develop a mouse model of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to elucidate the glomerular events in the early stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four-week-old mice were fed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or high-fat (42% of total calories from fat) diet, and body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, leptin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and GFR were monitored from 9 to 21 weeks or longer after the feeding programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mesangial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> was accessed by alpha-smooth muscle actin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glomerular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was determined using image analysis with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matrix deposition was determined by type IV collagen staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 9 weeks, mice fed a high-fat diet weighed more than mice fed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet (30.5+/-1.2 vs 22.3+/-0.5 g, p&lt;0.05), and mice fed a high-fat diet were hyperinsulinaemic (283.9+/-69.7 vs 102.9+/-36.4 pmol/l, p&lt;0.05), hyperglycaemic (8.0+/-0.6 vs 6.5+/-0.2 mmol/l, p&lt;0.05) and their leptin levels were increased six-fold (1.48+/-0.45 vs 0.25+/-0.03 ng/ml, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 13 weeks, mice fed a high-fat diet showed hyperfiltration (GFR; 440+/-60 vs 210+/-10 microl/min, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the early stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, mesangial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> was evident, shown by increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin in the glomeruli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 9 weeks, mice fed a high-fat diet already demonstrated increased type IV collagen deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 13 weeks, they developed enlarged glomerular tufts compared with those of their age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results of this study suggest that collagen IV deposition precedes the hyperfiltration and enlargement of glomeruli in early-stage diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Dedifferentiation</z:e> of mesangial cells may be associated with collagen IV deposition </plain></SENT>
