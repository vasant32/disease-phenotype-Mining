<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> were randomised to exenatide (n = 253; 5 microg twice daily for 4 weeks, 10 microg thereafter) or biphasic insulin aspart (n = 248; twice-daily doses titrated for optimal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control), while continuing with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycaemic control achieved with exenatide was non-inferior to that achieved with biphasic insulin aspart (mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, HbA(1c) change: exenatide -1.04 +/- 0.07%, biphasic insulin aspart -0.89 +/- 0.06%; difference -0.15 [95% CI -0.32 to 0.01]%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exenatide-treated patients lost weight, while patients treated with biphasic insulin aspart gained weight [between-group difference -5.4 (95% CI -5.9 to -5.0) kg] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both treatments reduced fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (exenatide -1.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.001; biphasic insulin aspart -1.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Greater reductions in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions following morning (p &lt; 0.001), midday (p = 0.002) and evening meals (p &lt; 0.001) were observed with exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The withdrawal rate was 21.3% (54/253) for exenatide and 10.1% (25/248) for biphasic insulin aspart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo> (33% incidence, 3.5% discontinuation) was the most common adverse event observed with exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Exenatide treatment resulted in HbA(1c) reduction similar to biphasic insulin aspart and provided better postprandial glycaemic control, making it a potential alternative for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with biphasic insulin aspart was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and lower risk of adverse gastrointestinal events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the availability of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents associated with weight reduction may be considered a therapeutic advance, the long-term implications of progressive weight reduction observed with exenatide have yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
