<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2 concentration was measured in plasma fractions of 363 middle-aged overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals (aged 61 +/- 12 years, BMI 30.1 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2), 15% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 12% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>) of a population survey carried out in 1990-1991 in Lombardy, Italy (Cremona Study), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) mortality was assessed in 2006 through Regional Health Registry files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2 was increased in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) and showed significant correlations with biochemical risk markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 15 years, among the 363 subjects, there were 82 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis age, sex, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin, fibrinogen, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, smoking habit, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2 were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of 113 subjects in whom data for C-reactive protein (CRP) were available, its level was not predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2 was independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
