<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To systematically review the literature regarding insulin use in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> METHODS: A Medline and Embase search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) published in English between 1 January 2000 and 1 April 2008, involving insulin therapy in adults with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The RCTs must comprise at least glycaemic control (glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and /or fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG)) and hypoglycaemic events as outcome measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Pubmed search resulted in 943 hits; the Embase search gave 692 hits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 116 RCTs were selected by title or abstract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eventually 78 trials met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The studies were very diverse and of different quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They comprised <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible insulin regimens with and without combination with oral medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or sulphonylurea after start of therapy with basal long-acting insulin results in better glycaemic control with less insulin requirements, less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and less hypoglycaemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-acting insulin analogues in combination with oral medication are associated with similar glycaemic control but fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the trials demonstrated better glycaemic control with premix insulin therapy than with a long-acting insulin once daily, but premix insulin causes more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analogue premix provides similar HbA1c, but lower postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels compared with human premix, without increase in hypoglycaemic events or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Drawing conclusions from the limited number of studies concerning basal-bolus regimen seems not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some studies showed that rapid-acting insulin analogues frequently result in a better HbA1c or postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> without increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than regular human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A once-daily basal insulin regimen added to oral medication is an ideal starting point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> next steps, from one to two or even more injections per day should be taken very carefully and in thorough deliberation with the patient, who has to comply with such a regimen for many years </plain></SENT>
