<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and clinical outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the Saskatchewan Health databases, 12,272 new users of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents were identified between the years 1991 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (n = 1,833) were identified through administrative records based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 428 and grouped according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (n = 208), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy (n = 773), or combination therapy (n = 852) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause hospitalization, and the combination (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause hospitalization or mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average age of subjects was 72 years, 57% were male, and average follow-up was 2.5 +/- 2.0 (SD) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy, fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in subjects receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>: 404 (52%) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy versus 69 (33%) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70 [95% CI 0.54-0.91]) and 263 (31%) for combination therapy (0.61 [0.52-0.72]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or hospitalizations was also observed: 658 (85%) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy versus 160 (77%) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (0.83 [0.70-0.99]) and 681 (80%) for combination therapy (0.86 [0.77-0.96]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in time to first hospitalization between study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>, alone or in combination, in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with lower morbidity and mortality compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
