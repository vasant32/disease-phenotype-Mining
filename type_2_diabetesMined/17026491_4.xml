<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to determine differences, if any, in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and increased insulin requirements in insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and an elevated body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 192 patients with newly insulinized type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups: those with BMI &lt;26 (n = 102), BMI 26-30 (n = 50) and those with BMI &gt;30 (n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of insulin therapy and 12 months later, we compared HbA1c, BMI and required insulin doses in each group and evaluated <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and the increase in insulin requirement during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we investigated the influence of additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy on <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and insulin requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Body weight increased in the group with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMI from 68.8 +/- 9.2 to 70.8 +/- 9.4 kg (+2.9%) and in the other groups from 79.0 +/- 9.3 to 81.2 +/- 8.4 (+2.8%) and from 96.2 +/- 11.2 to 99.1 +/- 16.5 kg (+3.0%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences between the groups were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The insulin requirement increased by 22% in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weighted group and by 23% in both groups with overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in mean HbA1c was similar in the three groups (22, 18 and 22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy, the increment of insulin requirement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n = 40) was significantly lower (11 vs. 26%, p &lt; 0.01), and there was no significant difference between the groups with different BMIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the same period, the gain in body weight and the decrease of HbA1c were not significantly different in the patients with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> independent on the BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and increase in insulin requirement is similar in insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and elevated BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy reduces insulin requirement in patients with and without overweight </plain></SENT>
