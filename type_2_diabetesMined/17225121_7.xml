<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether serum levels of IL-18, a proinflammatory cytokine, were a predictor of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 249 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> were enrolled in an observational follow-up study (median follow-up 7 years), and their stage of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was classified and their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, serum levels of IL-18 were higher in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (n = 76) than in those with normoalbuminuria (n = 173) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum levels of IL-18 were associated with the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> to a higher stage in normoalbuminuric subjects (118 [interquartile range 91-159] ng/l vs 155 [interquartile range 121-205] ng/l, p = 0.003), but not in microalbuminuric subjects (154 [interquartile range 113-200] ng/l vs 160 [interquartile range 101-190] ng/l, p = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjusted risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was 3.6 (95% CI 1.2-10.4) in normoalbuminuric subjects with serum IL-18 levels above the median (&gt;/=134.6 ng/l), and was significantly enhanced in those urinary AERs at the upper end of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (7.5 mug/min &lt;/= AER &lt; 20 microg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the annual rate of decline in eGFR, when examined in the study population as a whole, was significantly greater in subjects with serum IL-18 levels above the median than in other subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results of our observational follow-up study indicate that elevated serum levels of IL-18 may be a predictor of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
