<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between alcohol consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> we conducted a meta-analysis of published epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from 13 cohorts were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of these studies are consistent with regard to moderate alcohol consumption, indicating a protective effect in the order of 30% (relative risk [RR]meta = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.67-0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reduced risk is seen in men as well as in women, although few studies investigated women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No protective effect of high alcohol consumption was seen and one cannot rule out that large intakes of alcohol may increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results from published studies suggest a U-shaped relationship between alcohol and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but this is based on rather few studies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> design and definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It seems important to further investigate if, and to what extent, high alcohol consumption increases the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspects of moderate alcohol consumption also need further investigation; these include type of drink, frequency of drinking, sex and ethnic differences </plain></SENT>
