<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a risk score to predict people at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Thai cohort of 2,677 individuals, aged 35-55 years, without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, was resurveyed after 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to identify baseline risk factors that predicted the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; a simple model that included only those risk factors as significant (P &lt; 0.05) when adjusted for each other was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coefficients from this model were transformed into components of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This score was tested in a Thai validation cohort of a different 2,420 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 361 individuals developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the exploratory cohort during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significant predictive variables in the simple model were age, BMI, waist circumference, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in parents or siblings A cutoff score of 6 of 17 produced the optimal sum of sensitivity (77%) and specificity (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adding impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> status to the model slightly increased the AUC to 0.78; adding <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> and/or high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> barely improved the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The validation cohort demonstrated similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk score, based on a set of variables not requiring laboratory tests, can be used for early intervention to delay or prevent the disease in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adding impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> status to this model only modestly improves the predictive ability </plain></SENT>
