<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We have generated a heterozygous glucokinase knockout mouse (gk(del/wt)), upon which we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) with respect to metabolic control and both hepatic and beta-cell gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the in vitro efficacy of a glucokinase activator (GKA) on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in gk(del/wt)mouse islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male gk(del/wt)and gk(wt/wt)mice were grouped (n = 8-10) at 10 weeks of age and fed HFD or chow diet (CD) for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple parameters including blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further animal groups were used for in vitro GSIS and islet and liver gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: gk(del/wt)mice showed early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, raised glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, impaired GSIS and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance but no change in plasma cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After HFD feeding, insulin levels of gk(del/wt)mice were less than half that of gk(wt/wt)mice, although they were equivalent to gk(wt/wt)mice on CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While gk(wt/wt)mice maintained moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, gk(del/wt)mice became overtly diabetic, with worsened <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A GKA (GKA50) increased GSIS, at 10 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, in gk(del/wt)mice to an extent at least as great as that seen in gk(wt/wt)mice on both CD and HFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>gk(del/wt)mice showed only a small number of changes in gene expression compared with gk(wt/wt)mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose the high fat-fed gk(del/wt)mouse as a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and report retained efficacy of a GKA on in vitro GSIS </plain></SENT>
