<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Pro-Active Call Center Treatment Support (PACCTS), using trained nonmedical telephonists supported by specially designed software and a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nurse, can effectively improve glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized controlled implementation trial of 1-year duration was conducted in Salford, U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The trial comprised 591 randomly selected individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By random allocation, 197 individuals were assigned to the usual care (control) group and 394 to the PACCTS (intervention) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle advice and drug treatment in both groups followed local guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PACCTS patients were telephoned according to a protocol with the frequency of calls proportional to the last HbA(1c) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was absolute reduction in HbA(1c), and the secondary outcome was the proportion of patients reducing HbA(1c) by at least 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 332 patients (84%) in the PACCTS group and 176 patients (89%) in the control group completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Final HbA(1c) values were available in 374 patients (95%) in the PACCTS group and 180 patients (92%) in the usual care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with usual care, HbA(1c) improved by 0.31% (95% CI 0.11-0.52, P = 0.003) overall in the PACCTS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients with baseline HbA(1c) &gt;7%, the improvement increased to 0.49% (0.21-0.77, P &lt; 0.001), whereas in patients with baseline HbA(1c) &lt;7% there was no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference in the proportions of patients achieving a &gt;/=1% reduction in HbA(1c) significantly favored the PACCTS intervention: 10% (4-16, P &lt; 0.001) overall and 15% (7-24, P &lt; 0.001) for patients with baseline HbA(1c) &gt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an urban Caucasian trial population with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> HbA(1c) &gt;7%, PACCTS facilitated significant improvement in glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further research should extend the validity of findings to rural communities and other ethnic groups, as well as to smoking and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
