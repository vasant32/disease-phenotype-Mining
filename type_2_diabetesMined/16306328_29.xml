<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemokines have been hypothesized to be involved in macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and might therefore play an important role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related disorders like type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of 1,653 individuals aged 55-74 years participating in a population-based survey in southern Germany (the Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg [KORA] [Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg] Survey S4, 1999-2001), 236 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 242 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and 244 normoglycemic control subjects were studied for circulating concentrations of interleukin (IL)-8; RANTES (regulated on activation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-cell expressed, and secreted); interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), and eotaxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic concentrations of RANTES were higher in individuals with IGT or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in control subjects, whereas IL-8 levels were elevated in type 2 diabetic patients only (P &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IP-10 and eotaxin were not significantly associated with IGT or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for age, sex, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, and IL-6 did not alter these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that RANTES and IL-8 may be involved in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>-related risk factors and of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is no general upregulation of chemokine production in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but rather an association of the disease with specific members of the chemokine family </plain></SENT>
