<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted an observational study of 284 insulin-treated veterans with stable Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects completed the University of Michigan <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Research and Training Centre Knowledge Test, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care Profile, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Family Behaviour Checklist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop a model for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge score based upon clinical and psychosocial variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred eighty subjects were evaluated in a derivation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age +/- SD was 65.4+/-9.6 years, 94% were men, and 36% were members of a minority group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Performance on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge test was poor (64.9+/-15.3% correct) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Self-perceived understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> management objectives explained only 6% of the variance in the knowledge scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that age, years of schooling, duration of treatment, cognitive function, sex, and level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were independent determinants of the knowledge score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the model was applied to 104 subjects in a validation set, there was a strong correlation between observed and predicted scores (r=0.537; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Stable, insulin-treated veterans have major deficiencies in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge that could impair their ability to provide self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model comprised of demographic variables and psychosocial profiling can identify patients who have limited <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge and be used to assess individual barriers to ongoing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education </plain></SENT>
