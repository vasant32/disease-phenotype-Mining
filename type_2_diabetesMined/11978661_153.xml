<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to assess the ability of C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged men in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline plasma samples for CRP measurement were available for 5,245 men of whom 127 were classified as having a transition from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the study, based on American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline CRP was an important predictor of the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in univariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] for an increase of 1 SD = 1.55; 95% CI 1.32-1.82; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, CRP remained a predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development (HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.07-1.58; P = 0.0075) independent of other clinically employed predictors, including baseline BMI and fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a graded increase in risk across CRP quintiles throughout the study, evident at even 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest quintile (CRP &gt;4.18 mg/l) was associated with a greater than threefold risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 3.07; 95% CI 1.33-7.10) in a multivariate analysis at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, CRP predicts the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged men independently of established risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because CRP, the most commonly used <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase protein in clinical practice, is very stable in serum, our observations have clinical potential in helping to better predict individuals destined to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also add to the notion that low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is important in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
