<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis, and hepatic glucokinase activity are decreased in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether these defects are also present during more physiological enteral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration, we studied 11 diabetic and 14 nondiabetic volunteers using a combined organ catheterization-tracer infusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> was infused into the duodenum at a rate of 22 micromol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>min(-1) while supplemental <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was given intravenously to clamp <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at approximately 10 mmol/l in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endogenous hormone secretion was inhibited with somatostatin, and insulin was infused to maintain plasma concentrations at approximately 300 pmol/l (i.e., twofold higher than our previous experiments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance, splanchnic, and leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> extractions were markedly lower (P &lt; 0.01) in the diabetic subjects than in the nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> flux, a measure of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis, was approximately 35% lower (P &lt; 0.02) in the diabetic subjects than in the nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was entirely accounted for by a decrease (P &lt; 0.01) in the contribution of extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> because the contribution of the indirect pathway to hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis was similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither endogenous and splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> productions nor rates of appearance of the intraduodenally infused <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the portal vein differed between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, both muscle and splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake are impaired in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during enteral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The defect in splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake appears to be due to decreased uptake of extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, implying <z:mp ids='MP_0011606'>decreased glucokinase activity</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, abnormal hepatic and muscle (but not gut) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism are likely to contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
