<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Calibration and discrimination of the three prediction models were tested using prospective data for 1,482 Caucasian men and women, 50-75 years of age, who participated in the Hoorn Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> analyses were stratified by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 10 years of follow-up, a total of 197 CHD events, of which 43 were fatal, were observed in this population, with the highest percentage of first CHD events in the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Framingham and UKPDS prediction models overestimated the risk of first CHD event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the prediction models had a low to moderate discriminatory capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SCORE risk function was the best predictor of fatal CHD events in the group with NGT (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79 [95% CI 0.70-0.87]), whereas the UKPDS performed better in the intermediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> group (0.84 [0.74-0.94]) in the estimation of fatal CHD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of known diabetic patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prediction models had a higher discriminatory ability in the group with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Framingham function for prediction of the first CHD event is likely to overestimate an individual's absolute CHD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In CHD prevention, application of the SCORE and UKPDS functions might be useful in the absence of a more valid tool </plain></SENT>
