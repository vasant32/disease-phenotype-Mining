<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Ingested protein provides substrate for gluconeogenesis and strongly stimulates insulin and glucagon secretion, but it has little effect on the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ingested <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> also is a substrate for gluconeogenesis, modestly stimulates insulin and glucagon secretion, and has little effect on the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we were interested in determining if ingestion of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> along with protein would result in an additive, greater than additive, or less than additive effect on circulating insulin, glucagon, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven male subjects with untreated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were fasted overnight and then were given either 25 g <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, 25 g protein, 25 g <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> plus 25 g protein, or water only at 0800 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects also ingested 50 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on two separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon, alpha-amino nitrogen, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen, nonesterified fatty acids, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations were determined over the subsequent 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was only modestly increased and the area responses were similar when protein, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, or the combination was ingested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response to the combination was less than additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The insulin area response to protein was 2.5-fold greater than to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, and the response to the two nutrients was additive and quantitatively similar to the response to 50 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The glucagon area response was less than additive, i.e., there was an interaction between the protein and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> that resulted in a smaller than expected response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When protein and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> were ingested together, the insulin response was similar to that following ingestion of 50 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It also was as expected based on the response to the individual nutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glucagon responses were significantly less than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data may be useful in dietary planning for subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
