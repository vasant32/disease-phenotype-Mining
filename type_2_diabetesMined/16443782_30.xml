<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Altered cardiac metabolism and function (diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) has been observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that cardiac efficiency, the ratio of cardiac work (pressure-volume area [<z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi>]) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVo(2)), is reduced in diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments used ex vivo working hearts from control db/+, db/db (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), and db/+ mice given <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ; type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi> and ventricular function were assessed with a 1.4-F pressure-volume catheter at low (0.3 mmol/l) and high (1.4 mmol/l) fatty acid concentrations with simultaneous measurements of MVo(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Substrate oxidation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration were measured in separate experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic hearts showed decreased cardiac efficiency, revealed as an 86 and 57% increase in unloaded MVo(2) in db/db and STZ-administered hearts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slope of the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi>-MVo(2) regression line was increased for db/db hearts after elevation of fatty acids, suggesting that contractile inefficiency could also contribute to the overall reduction in cardiac efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The end-diastolic and end-systolic pressure-volume relationships in db/db hearts were shifted to the left with elevated end-diastolic pressure, suggesting left ventricular remodeling and/or myocardial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, by means of pressure-volume technology, we have for the first time documented decreased cardiac efficiency in diabetic hearts caused by oxygen waste for noncontractile purposes </plain></SENT>
