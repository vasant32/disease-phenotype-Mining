<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is more prevalent in the indigenous Polynesian population of New Zealand (Maori) than in Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Maori psychiatric patients was associated with antipsychotic treatment and to investigate the mechanism of an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty adult Maori psychiatric patients receiving antipsychotic medication for &gt;6 months and 30 healthy, age-, sex-, and BMI-matched control subjects were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early morning fasting blood samples were analyzed for plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, A1C, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, IGF-1, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>-binding globulin (CBG), and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient group had significantly higher median fasting insulin plasma levels than the control group (P = 0.002), which were independent of BMI, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the patient group had significantly higher total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> (P = 0.03) and lower CBG levels (P = 0.004) than the control group, resulting in significantly higher levels of free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient group was also significantly more hypoglycemic (P = 0.026) and hypertriglyceridemic (P = 0.028) than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in BMI, waist circumference, A1C, total cholesterol, IGF-1, or adiponectin levels between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is seen in Maori psychiatric patients treated with antipsychotic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Polynesian ethnicity should be considered in prescribing practice and general care of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may have an important role in the mechanism by which this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> develops </plain></SENT>
