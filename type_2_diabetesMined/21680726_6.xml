<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of intensive glycemic control therapy (IT) on insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients compared with subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-eight newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to IT for 2 weeks and followed up for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were conducted in NGT, IGT, and diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin were measured before and after IT and at the 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IT lowered the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) significantly, from 3.12 ± 1.4 (mean ± SD) to 1.72 ± 0.8, a level comparable to the IGT (1.96 ± 1.1) and NGT (1.37 ± 0.6) subjects in the remission group; however, no HOMA-IR improvement was observed in nonremission subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HOMA-β in the remission group was improved (mean, interquartile range) from 18.4 (8.3-28.5) to 44.6 (32.1-69.1) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response of insulin (AIRins) from 1.50 ± 0.22 to 1.83 ± 0.19 μIU/mL after IT, but was still significantly lower than those in NGT individuals (HOMA-β: 86.4 [56.7-185.2], P &lt; 0.01; AIRins: 2.54 ± 0.39 μIU/mL, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After IT and at 1 year, the hyperbolic relationship between HOMA-β and HOMA sensitivity of remission subjects shifted close to that of IGT subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IT in newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not only partially restored β-cell function but also greatly restored insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with IGT and NGT subjects, β-cell function was less restored than insulin sensitivity after IT in the remission subjects </plain></SENT>
