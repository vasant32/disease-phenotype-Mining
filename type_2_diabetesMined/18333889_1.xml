<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Therapeutic benefits of combining the long-acting human glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) analog, liraglutide (0.4 mg/kg/day), with insulin sensitizer, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg/day), were assessed in severely diabetic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty rats for 42 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Impact on glycaemic control was assessed by glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1C)) at day 28 and by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test at day 42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Liraglutide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> synergistically improved glycaemic control as reflected by a marked decrease in HbA(1C) (liraglutide + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>: 4.8 +/- 0.3%; liraglutide: 8.8 +/- 0.6%; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>: 7.9 +/- 0.4%; vehicle: 9.7 +/- 0.3%) and improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at day 42 (area under the curve; liraglutide + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>: 4244 +/- 445 mmol/l x min; liraglutide: 7164 +/- 187 mmol/l x min; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>: 7430 +/- 446 mmol/l x min; vehicle: 8093 +/- 139 mmol/l x min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 24-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile at day 38 was significantly decreased only in the liraglutide + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 24-h insulin profile was significantly elevated only in the liraglutide + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide significantly decreased food intake alone and in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> alone increased cumulated food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, rats on liraglutide alone gained significantly less weight than vehicle-treated rats, whereas rats on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> alone gained significantly more body weight than vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, combination therapy with liraglutide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> caused the largest <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, probably reflecting marked improvement of energy balance because of reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with insulinotropic GLP-1 agonist liraglutide and insulin sensitizer, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, improves glycaemic control above and beyond what would be expected from additive effects of the two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
