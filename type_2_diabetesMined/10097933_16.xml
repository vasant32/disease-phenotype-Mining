<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An increased plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level is an important risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have endeavored to determine the relationship between plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels and the presence of coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 145 Japanese patients (95 men and 50 women) who underwent routine coronary angiography to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or suspected CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level, and parameters of fibrinolytic activity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were identified as diabetic or nondiabetic by the new American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied were confirmed by coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> was quantified using CAD scoring on the basis of prior reports, and subjects were graded as nonstenotic, stenotic single-vessel, stenotic two-vessel, or stenotic three-vessel based on the number of stenotic coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into two groups: those with stenotic vessels and those without stenotic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level was significantly higher in patients with than in patients without stenotic vessels (13.8 +/- 3.9 vs. 11.7 +/- 3.9 mumol/l, respectively; P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of stenotic coronary arteries, which was used to grade each case as nonstenotic, stenotic single-vessel, stenotic two-vessel, or stenotic three-vessel, was related only to the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level in the diabetic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> [DM]) group, but it was associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) in the nondiabetic (non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> [non-DM]) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spearman's rank correlation test demonstrated that the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level was strongly correlated with CAD score, both in the entire study group and in the DM group (P = 0.003 for the entire group and P = 0.011 for the DM group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, which was defined as total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level &gt; 14.0 mumol/l, was seen in 57 (39.3%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The CAD score was highest in diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be a clear relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> and an increased risk of coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
