<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Studies on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in subjects with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001472'>familial predisposition</z:hpo> for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) traditionally produce inconsistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be due to small sample size, subject selection, matching procedures, and perhaps lack of a measure of physical fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study, we specifically tested the hypothesis that a family history of T2DM is associated with reduced VO(2max), measured by incremental bicycle ergometry, independent of insulin sensitivity estimated from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT; n = 424) and measured by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (n = 185) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects included in the study were young (34 +/- 10 years), healthy, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant with either a first-degree relative (FDR) with T2DM (n = 183), a second-degree relative with T2DM (n = 94), or no family history of T2DM (control subjects, n = 147) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI, percent body fat, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and habitual physical activity (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>; standard questionnaire) were comparable among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FDRs had significantly lower VO(2max) than control subjects: 40.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 45.2 +/- 0.9 ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>/kg lean body mass, P = 0.01 after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>, and insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI, percent body fat, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and habitual physical activity (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>; standard questionnaire) were comparable among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FDRs had significantly lower VO(2max) than control subjects: 40.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 45.2 +/- 0.9 ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>/kg lean body mass, P = 0.01 after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>, and insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity per se was not affected by family history of T2DM after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and percent body fat (P = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The appropriateness of beta-cell function for the individual insulin sensitivity (disposition index: product of a validated secretion parameter [OGTT] and sensitivity [clamp]) was significantly lower in FDRs (87 +/- 4 units) versus control subjects (104 +/- 6 units, P = 0.02 after adjusting for sex, age, and BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the larger OGTT group produced essentially the same results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these data are compatible with the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001472'>familial predisposition</z:hpo> for T2DM impairs maximal oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because habitual physical activity was not different, genetic factors may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, reduced VO(2max) precedes skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, providing a partial explanation for discrepancies in the literature </plain></SENT>
