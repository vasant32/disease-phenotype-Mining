<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is dissociation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> as risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to 1) quantify risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at follow-up with different combinations of these risk factors at baseline and 2) determine whether each is an independent risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 12,853 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from a South Korean occupational cohort, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) (homeostasis model assessment-IR ≥75th centile, ≥2.0), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> (defined by standard ultrasound criteria), and overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI ≥25 kg/m(2)) identified at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 5-year follow-up were estimated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 223 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from which 26 subjects had none of the three risk factors, 37 had one, 56 had two, and 104 had three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the fully adjusted model, the OR and CI for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 3.92 (2.86-5.37) for IR, 1.62 (1.17-2.24) for overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and 2.42 (1.74-3.36) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OR for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three factors in a fully adjusted model was 14.13 (8.99-22.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clustering of IR, overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> is common and markedly increases the odds of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but these factors also have effects independently of each other and of confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that treatment for each factor is needed to decrease risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
