<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor vildagliptin improves beta cell function both acutely and chronically (up to 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether this effect persists after cessation of treatment remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed the insulin secretory capacity in drug-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after a 52 week treatment period with vildagliptin or placebo, and again after a 12 week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted at a single university medical centre, and was a double-blind, randomised clinical trial in 59 drug-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> to either vildagliptin 100 mg (n = 29) or placebo (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was performed by a validated 1:1 system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither patient, nor caregiver, was informed about the assigned treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were drug-naive patients ≥30 years, with HbA(1c) ≤7.5% and BMI of 22-45 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mildly hyperglycaemic patient population was chosen to minimise <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity as a confounding variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell function was measured during an arginine-stimulated hyperglycaemic clamp at week 0, week 52 and after a 12 week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with at least one post-randomisation measure were analysed (intent-to-treat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two week vildagliptin 100 mg (n = 26) treatment increased the primary efficacy variable, combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and arginine-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion (AIR(arg)), by 5.0 ± 1.8 nmol/l × min, while it decreased by 0.8 ± 1.8 nmol/l × min with placebo (n = 25) (between-group difference p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant between-group difference in AIR(arg) was seen after the 12 week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The between-group difference adjusted mean 52 week changes from baseline was -0.19 ± 0.11, p = 0.098 and -0.22 ± 0.23%, p = 0.343 for HbA(1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no suspected drug treatment-related serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: One year treatment with vildagliptin significantly increased beta cell secretory capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This effect was not maintained after the washout, indicating that this increased capacity was not a disease modifying effect on beta cell mass and/or function </plain></SENT>
