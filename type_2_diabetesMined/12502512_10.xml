<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARgamma2 gene has been associated with reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an association between dizygotic twinning and PPARgamma gene polymorphisms has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the phenotypic appearance of the two polymorphisms (Pro12Ala and exon 6 C--&gt;T) in PPARgamma among elderly twins (207 monozygotic [MZ] and 342 dizygotic [DZ]) and evaluated whether they could explain previously reported differences in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin profiles among MZ and DZ twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a significant impact of the Pro12Ala polymorphism on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, diabetic status, homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and plasma insulin profiles in twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No impact of the silent exon 6 polymorphism on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis or plasma insulin profiles was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent of the polymorphisms, we observed a significant impact of zygosity status per se on the plasma insulin profile after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion, with the MZ twins being more hyperinsulinemic, indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, than the DZ twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonsignificantly higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were observed among MZ compared with DZ twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated an association between the Ala allele and reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the differences in metabolic profiles among MZ and DZ twins were not explained by differences in frequencies of the genetic variants and may be due to intrauterine environmental factors operating in twins independent of genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, our study simultaneously supports a role for both the intrauterine environment (thrifty phenotype) and for genetics (thrifty genotype) in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and perhaps <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in twins </plain></SENT>
