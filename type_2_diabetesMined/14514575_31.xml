<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence from a cohort of Caucasians recently suggests that an elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, Japanese subjects are skewed to lower CRP concentrations than westerners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the effect of CRP on the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Japanese is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 396 male and 551 female nondiabetic Japanese Americans who underwent a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>) and were then followed for an average of 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether elevated serum CRP level is a risk factor in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with a high CRP level showed a significantly higher incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with subjects with a low level among both men (P = 0.028) and women (P = 0.004) in a log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a Cox proportional hazards model dividing quartiles of CRP, the hazard ratios for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development in the highest versus lowest quartile of CRP levels were 2.84 (95% CI 1.09-7.39) among men and 3.11 (1.25-7.75) among women after adjustment for age, smoking, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, classification of a 75-g <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>, hormone replacement therapy (among women), BMI, and homeostasis model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among Japanese Americans, CRP may be a risk factor for development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independent of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may be closely related to the mechanism of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Japanese Americans </plain></SENT>
