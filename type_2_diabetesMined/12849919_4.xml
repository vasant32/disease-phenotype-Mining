<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This open, uncontrolled surveillance study examined the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, a new sulphonylurea, administered once daily in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,770 patients were enrolled in the study, and 284 patients were selected for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received 0.5 to &gt;4 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> once daily for 1.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was reduced from 8.4% at baseline to 7.1% after 4 months and 6.9% after 1 and 1.5 years (median intra-individual change from baseline: -1.4, -1.5, and -1.7%, respectively; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> also resulted in significant and stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> relative to baseline, with the exception of patients with a body mass index of &lt;25 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight was reduced from 79.8 kg at baseline to 77.9 kg after 4 months, 77.2 kg after 1 year, and 76.9 kg after 1.5 years (mean intra-individual change from baseline: -1.9 kg, P&lt;0.0001; -2.9 kg, P&lt;0.05; -3.0 kg, P&lt;0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, once daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> provides effective glycaemic control, and may have advantages over other sulphonylureas, because it exhibits weight neutralizing/reducing effects in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
