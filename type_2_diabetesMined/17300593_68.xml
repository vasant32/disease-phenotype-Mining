<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 24-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study assessed the effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin (100 mg q.d.), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30 mg q.d.) and vildagliptin combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (100/30 mg q.d. or 50/15 mg q.d.) in 607 drug-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in HbA(1c) in patients receiving initial combination therapy compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 24-week treatment, adjusted mean changes in HbA(1c) from baseline (approximately 8.7%) in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy, 50/15 mg combination, 100/30 mg combination and vildagliptin monotherapy were -1.4 +/- 0.1%, -1.7 +/- 0.1%, -1.9 +/- 0.1% and -1.1 +/- 0.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both low-dose and high-dose combinations were significantly more efficacious than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> alone (p = 0.039 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusted mean changes in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were -1.9 +/- 0.2, -2.4 +/- 0.2, -2.8 +/- 0.2 and -1.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/l respectively, and both combination groups were significantly more effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy (p = 0.022 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of adverse events ranged from 45.8% in the low-dose combination to 51.6% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was highest in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy (9.3%) and lowest in those receiving low-dose combination (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One mild hypoglycaemic event was reported by one patient receiving high-dose combination and one patient receiving vildagliptin monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: First-line treatment with vildagliptin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> combination in patients with T2DM provides better glycaemic control than either monotherapy component yet has minimal risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and a tolerability profile comparable with component monotherapy </plain></SENT>
