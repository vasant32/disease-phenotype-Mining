<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The most recent nationally recognised guidelines for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from eight European countries (Belgium, England/Wales, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument was used for quality assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Details of recommendations for key process and outcome indicators were also extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Appraisal and data extraction were conducted independently by two researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AGREE domain scores varied between guidelines, including a range of 31-95% for rigour of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest mean domain scores were for Scope and Purpose (81%) and Clarity and Presentation (85%); the lowest was for Stakeholder Involvement (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific recommendations, including targets relating to intermediate outcomes, were broadly similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, at detailed level, there were variations, particularly in terms of the level of information provided, for example, only two countries' guidelines provided cut-off points in relation to risk associated with waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that there are some areas of good practice relating to guideline development where more attention is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite a substantial degree of consensus for specified targets, observed differences at detailed level suggest a lack of consistency in relation to some aspects of the information provided to clinicians across Europe </plain></SENT>
