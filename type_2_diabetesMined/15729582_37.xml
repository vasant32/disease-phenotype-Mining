<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and the degree of glycaemia and triglyceridaemia, to antioxidative function of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particle subspecies in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Five <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subfractions (2b, 2a, 3a, 3b, 3c) were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation from well-controlled type 2 diabetic subjects (n=20) and normolipidaemic, non-diabetic controls (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific antioxidative activity (capacity to protect <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from oxidation on a unit particle mass or on a particle number basis), chemical composition and enzymatic activities were measured in each subfraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was assessed as plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostanes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Specific antioxidative activity of small dense HDL3b and 3c particles in diabetic patients was significantly diminished (up to -47%, on a particle mass or particle number basis) as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostanes</z:chebi> were markedly elevated (2.9-fold) in diabetic patients, were negatively correlated with both specific antioxidative activity of HDL3 subfractions and plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) levels, and were positively correlated with glycaemia and triglyceridaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paraoxonase 1 activity was consistently lower in diabetic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subfractions and was positively correlated with HDL3 antioxidative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The altered chemical composition of diabetic HDL3 subfractions (core cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> enrichment) was equally correlated with diminished antioxidative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Antioxidative activity of small dense <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> is deficient in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, is intimately linked to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, glycaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia and primarily reflects abnormal intrinsic physicochemical properties of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
