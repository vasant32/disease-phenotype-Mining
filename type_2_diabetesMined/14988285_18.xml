<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In later stages of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, proinsulin and proinsulin-like molecules are secreted in increasing amounts with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recently introduced chemiluminescence assay is able to detect the uncleaved "intact" proinsulin and differentiate it from proinsulin-like molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This investigation explored the predictive value of intact proinsulin as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In total, 48 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (20 women and 28 men, aged 60 +/- 9 years [means +/- SD], <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 5.1 +/- 3.8 years, BMI 31.2 +/- 4.8 kg/m2, and HbA1c 6.9 +/- 1.2%) were studied by means of an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and determination of fasting values of intact proinsulin, insulin, resistin, adiponectin, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was determined by means of minimal model analysis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi>) (as the gold standard) and homeostatis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between intact proinsulin values and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> P&lt;0.05 and HOMA P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevation of intact proinsulin values above the reference range (&gt;10 pmol/l) showed a very high specificity (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> 100% and HOMA 92.9%) and a moderate sensitivity (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> 48.6% and HOMA 47.1%) as marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin values were slightly lower in the insulin resistant group, but no correlation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> could be detected for resistin in the cross-sectional design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated intact proinsulin seems to indicate an advanced stage of beta-cell exhaustion and is a highly specific marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It might be used as arbitrary marker for the therapeutic decision between secretagogue, sensitizer, or insulin therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
