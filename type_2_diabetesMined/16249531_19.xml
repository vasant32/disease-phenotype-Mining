<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population was composed of 100 consecutive patients regularly attending a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Cear√° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects' quality of sleep was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002189'>excessive daytime sleepiness</z:hpo> (EDS) was measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RLS was diagnosed using the four minimum criteria defined by the International <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Restless Legs Syndrome</z:e> Study Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other relevant clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained by interview and chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RLS was found in 27% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor sleep quality was present in 45% of cases and was associated with age (P = 0.04), <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.001), and RLS (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EDS was found in 26% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed an association between RLS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (odds ratio 12.85 [95% CI 2.83-58.40], P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RLS is common in type 2 diabetic patients and can be a major cause of sleep disruption in these patients </plain></SENT>
