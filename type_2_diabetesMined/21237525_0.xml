<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 95 urine samples from type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria (DM, n=30), <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (DNl, n=25) and macroalbuminuria (DN2, n=20), and healthy controls (n=20) were analyzed by SELDI-TOF-MS (the surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) technology combined with bioinformatics tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 300 proteins or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from 1 to 80 kDa were obtained using ProteinChip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>About 40 of them with the m/z values from 2008.78 to 79176.55 Da were significantly differentiated between type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four proteins of mass 2797.03, 4545.77, 4984.03 and 9083.71 Da were selected as the potential biomarkers for T2DN with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 96.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ProteinChip technology can help to discover new biomarkers and provide a novel non-invasive tool to early diagnosis of T2DN </plain></SENT>
