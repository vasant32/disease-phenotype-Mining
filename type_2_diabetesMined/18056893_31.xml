<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Older adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are more likely to fall, but little is known about risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications or treatments are associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in older diabetic adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Health, Aging, and Body Composition cohort of well-functioning older adults, participants reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in the previous year at annual visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) for more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002359'>frequent falls</z:hpo> among 446 diabetic participants whose mean age was 73.6 years, with an average follow-up of 4.9 years, were estimated with continuation ratio models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first year, 23[corrected]% reported falling; 22, 26, 30[corrected], and 31[corrected]% fell in subsequent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In adjusted models, reduced peroneal nerve response amplitude (OR 1.50 -95% CI 1.07-2.12], worst quartile versus others); higher cystatin-C, a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>reduced renal function</z:hpo> (1.38 [1.11-1.71], for 1 SD increase); poorer contrast sensitivity (1.41 [0.97-2.04], worst quartile versus others); and low A1C in insulin users (4.36 [1.32-14.46], A1C &lt;or=6 vs. &gt;8%) were associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those using oral hypoglycemic medications but not insulin, low A1C was not associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> (1.29 [0.65-2.54], A1C &lt;or=6 vs. &gt;8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for physical performance explained some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, of these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In older diabetic adults, reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications may prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Achieving lower A1C levels with oral hypoglycemic medications was not associated with more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002359'>frequent falls</z:hpo>, but, among those using insulin, A1C &lt;or=6% increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
