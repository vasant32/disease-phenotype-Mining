<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that a 9p21.3 locus was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we carried out a large-scale case-control study in the GeneID Chinese Han population to 1) further replicate the association of 9p21.3 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2) assess the association of these SNPs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three SNPs (rs2383208, rs10811661, and rs10757283) were genotyped in two GeneID cohorts of 3,167 Chinese Han individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case-control association design was used to determine the association of the SNPs with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gensini scores were calculated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> subjects and were tested for association with the variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regressions were performed on association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The association between two of the three SNPs and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was replicated in the GeneID population (rs2383208, P = 0.936; rs10811661-T, P = 0.02, odds ratio [OR] = 1.23; rs10757283-C, P = 0.003, OR = 1.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same two SNPs also contributed to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) (rs10811661-T, P = 0.002, OR = 1.19; rs10757283-C, P = 0.003, OR = 1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, rs10757283 was associated with severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> estimated by the Gensini scoring system (risk allele C, quantitative-trait regression adjusted P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the first time to our knowledge, our results indicated that the same 9p21.3 locus, represented by SNPs rs10811661 and rs10757283, contributed to the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in our GeneID Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
