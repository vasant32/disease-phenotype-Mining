<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a combined resistance and aerobic training program would improve insulin sensitivity compared with aerobic training alone in postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A second objective was to relate the improved insulin sensitivity to changes in abdominal adipose tissue (AT) and thigh muscle density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 28 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to one of three 16-week treatments: control, aerobic only training (Ae only), or aerobic plus resistance training (Ae+RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and posttreatment outcome measures included <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and computed tomography scans of abdominal AT and mid-thigh skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in the Ae+RT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both exercise groups had reduced abdominal subcutaneous and visceral AT and increased muscle density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Ae+RT training group exhibited a significantly greater increase in muscle density than the Ae only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was independently associated with changes in subcutaneous AT, visceral AT, and muscle density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Muscle density retained a relationship with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal after controlling for abdominal AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adding resistance training to aerobic training enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improved insulin sensitivity is related to loss of abdominal subcutaneous and visceral AT and to increased muscle density </plain></SENT>
