<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The largest variations in growth rates occur during the first postnatal years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that early postnatal variations in height and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and IGF-I levels may be associated with risk markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277562" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adult disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured the fasting insulin sensitivity (Homeostasis model) and insulin secretion post-oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (insulinogenic index 0-30 min) in 851 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 8-year-old children from a prospective birth cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined associations between size at birth, postnatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and circulating IGF-I levels with insulin sensitivity and secretion at 8 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting insulin sensitivity at 8 years was closely related to current BMI (r= -0.33, p&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower insulin sensitivity and higher BMI and waist circumference were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> predicted by greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> between birth to 3 years of age (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.0005); lower birth weight was associated with reduced insulin sensitivity only in the highest current BMI tertile ( r=0.17, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lower insulin secretion was related to smaller size at birth ( p=0.01), independent of postnatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower insulin secretion was also independently related to shorter stature at 8 years of age relative to parental height ( p=0.047) and with lower plasma IGF-I levels at 5 years of age ( n=252, p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Associations between lower birth weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may be dependent on rapid <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> during the early postnatal years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, irrespective of postnatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, smaller size at birth, lower IGF-I levels and lower childhood height predicted reduced compensatory insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
