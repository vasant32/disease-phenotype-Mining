<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth Study, a population-based multicenter observational study of youth aged 0-19 years with physician-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were used to estimate the prevalence and incidence of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information obtained by questionnaire, physical examination, and blood and urine collection was analyzed to describe the characteristics of youth who completed a study visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among Hispanic American youth, type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was more prevalent than type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including in youth aged 10-19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant sex differences in type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for female subjects aged 10-14 years was twice that of male subjects (P &lt; 0.005), while among youth aged 15-19 years the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exceeded that of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for female subjects (P &lt; 0.05) but not for male subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor glycemic control, defined as A1C &gt;or=9.5%, as well as high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were common among youth aged &gt;or=15 years with either type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent of youth with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Factors such as poor glycemic control, elevated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and a high prevalence of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may put Hispanic youth with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at risk for future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications </plain></SENT>
