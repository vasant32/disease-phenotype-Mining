<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In type 2 diabetic patients, cases who developed CAD were compared retrospectively with controls that did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 20-year risk of CAD at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, using the UKPDS risk engine, was used to match cases with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 76 cases of CAD were compared with 152 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hazard of developing CAD (95% CI) associated with initial treatment increased by 2.4-fold (1.3-4.3, P=0.004) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>; 2-fold (0.9-4.6, P=0.099) with glipizide; 2.9-fold (1.6-5.1, P=0.000) with either, and was unchanged with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hazard decreased 0.3-fold (0.7-1.7, P=0.385) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, 0.4-fold (0.7-1.3, P=0.192) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>, and 0.4-fold (0.7-1.1, P=0.09) with either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initiating treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> or glipizide is associated with increased risk of CAD in comparison to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If confirmed, this may be important because most Indian patients receive the cheaper older sulphonylureas, and present guidelines do not distinguish between individual agents </plain></SENT>
