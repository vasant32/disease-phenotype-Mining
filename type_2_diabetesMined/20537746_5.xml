<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin, a potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, as add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in Japanese patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) who were inadequately controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared vildagliptin 50mg twice-daily (n=102) with placebo (n=100) when added to a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (&gt;or=1mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment groups were balanced at baseline (glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> [HbA(1c)], 7.9%; fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 163.8 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During treatment HbA(1c) decreased progressively with vildagliptin, but remained unchanged with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean change (AMDelta) at endpoint was -1.0+/-0.1 and -0.1+/-0.1% in vildagliptin- and placebo-treated patients (between-group Delta=-1.0+/-0.1%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of vildagliptin-treated patients had HbA(1c) &lt;or=6.5% compared to placebo-treated patients (45% vs. 3%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AMDelta FPG was -20.9+/-2.8 mg/dL with vildagliptin compared to 6.3+/-2.8 mg/dL with placebo (between-group Delta=-27.2+/-3.9 mg/dL, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in vildagliptin and placebo groups reported similar incidences of adverse events (AEs) (59.8% vs. 57.0%), serious AEs (0% vs. 2.0%), suspected drug-related AEs (21.6% vs. 23.0%), and discontinuation due to AEs (1.0% vs. 3.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypogylcaemia was reported in two (vildagliptin) and one (placebo) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vildagliptin is effective and well tolerated as an add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in Japanese patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
