<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e>) episodes occurred in diabetic adults and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed diabetic patients of admissions with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> in West China Hospital in Chengdu from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory data including Î²-cell function and autoantibody status were collected respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as having type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on clinical diagnosis and treatment history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And groups were compared for differences in vital statistics and biochemical profiles at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Detailed and accurate information was obtained in relation to 263 of patients accounted for the 287 admissions admitted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e>, of whom 41 patients had type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (15.59%) meanwhile 178 patients were diagnosis as T2DM (67.68%), and 37 patients could not be "typed" were classified as atypical DM (14.07%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) and five patients with other specific types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty admissions (22.81%) were newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, of which 28 admissions (46.67%) were atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common contributing factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (39.16%), followed by noncompliance with anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment including omission of insulin (25.5%), unknown causes (25.86%) and other medical conditions (11.73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of note, these middle-age <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> male patients with atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> often lapse into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> without identifiable precipitating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> could occur not only in T1DM but also in patients with T2DM under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or stress condition, furthermore without any identifiable precipitant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> and its clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> have significant implications for diagnosing and classification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More attention and prevention strategies are needed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo>-prone atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
