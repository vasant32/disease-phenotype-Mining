<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The USF1 gene is located at chromosome 1q22-q23, within the most consistently replicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility locus in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have examined the contribution of eight common USF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in the French Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the USF1 SNPs genotyped, including two SNPs previously associated with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0008356'>combined hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (rs2073658 and rs3737787), showed evidence of association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, USF1 SNPs were not associated with plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> A1 or B in normoglycemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of four common USF1 haplotypes were identified, accounting for &gt;99% of chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the USF1 haplotype distribution of the case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we report here that we were unable to find any evidence to support the hypothesis that genetic variation in the USF1 gene makes a significant contribution to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in the French Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
