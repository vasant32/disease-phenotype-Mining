<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-efficacy and self-management behavior in an urban, diverse, low-income population with a high prevalence of limited health literacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We administered an oral questionnaire in Spanish and English to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at two primary care clinics at a public hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured self-efficacy, health literacy, and self-management behaviors using established instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed multivariate regressions to explore the associations between self-efficacy and self-management, adjusting for clinical and demographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested for interactions between self-efficacy, race/ethnicity, and health literacy on self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study participants were ethnically diverse (18% Asian/Pacific Islander, 25% African American, 42% Latino/a, and 15% white), and 52% had limited health literacy (short version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults score &lt;23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> self-efficacy was associated with four of the five self-management domains (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, with each 10% increase in self-efficacy score, patients were more likely to report optimal diet (0.14 day more per week), exercise (0.09 day more per week), self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (odds ratio 1.16), and foot care (1.22), but not medication adherence (1.10, P = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The associations between self-efficacy and self-management were consistent across race/ethnicity and health literacy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy was associated with self-management behaviors in this vulnerable population, across both race/ethnicity and health literacy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of the associations suggests that, among diverse populations, further study of the determinants of and barriers to self-management is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Policy efforts should be focused on expanding the reach of self-management interventions to include ethnically diverse populations across the spectrum of health literacy </plain></SENT>
