<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic patients, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> are glycated and more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These alterations are likely to modify the capacity of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> to reverse the inhibition of vasodilation induced by oxidised <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using rabbit aorta rings, we compared the ability of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> from 16 type 2 diabetic patients and 13 control subjects to suppress the inhibition of vasodilation that is induced by oxidised <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Oxidised <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation (maximal relaxation [Emax] = 58.2+/-14.6 vs 99.3+/-5.2% for incubation without any <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> from control subjects significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of oxidised <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> on vasodilatation (Emax = 77.6+/-12.9 vs 59.5+/-7.7%, p &lt; 0.001), whereas <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> from type 2 diabetic patients had no effect (Emax = 52.4+/-20.4 vs 57.2+/-18.7%, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients than in control subjects (5.3+/-2.2 vs 3.1+/-1.4%, p &lt; 0.01) and was highly inversely correlated to Emax for oxidised <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic patients (r = -0.71, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
