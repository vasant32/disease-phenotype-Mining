<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the independent associations of intra-abdominal fat (IAF), subcutaneous abdominal fat (SAF) and STF with future risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively followed 489 non-diabetic Japanese Americans (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2) 32.7%, ≥30.0 kg/m(2) 5.4%) over 10 years for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> defined by use of hypoglycaemic medication or a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥7.0 mmol/l or 2 h ≥11.1 mmol/l during an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STF, SAF and IAF area were measured by computed tomography scan and mid-thigh circumference (TC) by tape measure at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 10 years, 103 people developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STF area was not independently associated with the odds of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a univariate or multiple logistic regression model (OR for a 1 SD increase 0.8 [95% CI 0.5, 1.2]) adjusted for age, sex, BMI, IAF and SAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only fat depot associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> odds in this model was IAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TC was borderline significantly associated with a lower odds of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.7 [95% CI 0.5, 1.0], p = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Similar to other research, TC was negatively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, whereas STF was not, arguing that the negative association between TC and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> observed in other research is not due to STF mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IAF area emerged as the only measured fat depot that was independently associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
