<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ACDC adiponectin encoding gene have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in several populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the role of SNPs -11,377C &gt; G, -11,391G &gt; A, +45T &gt; G, and +276G &gt; T in 2,579 French Caucasians (1,229 morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 1,350 control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found an association between severe forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and -11,377C (odds ratio 1.23, P = 0.001) and +276T (1.19, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, alternative alleles -11,377G and +276G have been previously reported as risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transmission disequilibrium tests showed a trend in overtransmission (56.7%) of a risk haplotype 1((C))-1((G))-1((T))-2((T)) including -11,377C and +276T in 634 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> trios (P = 0.097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family-based analysis in 400 trios from the general population indicated association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> haplotype and higher adiponectin levels, suggesting a role of hyperadiponectinemia in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, experiments studying the putative roles of SNPs -11,377C &gt; G and +276G &gt; T on ACDC functionality were not conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, promoter SNP -11,391G &gt; A was associated with higher adiponectin levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children (P = 0.005) and in children from the general population (0.00007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro transcriptional assays showed that -11,391A may increase ACDC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study suggests that variations at the ACDC/adiponectin gene are associated with risk of severe forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying these possible associations are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
