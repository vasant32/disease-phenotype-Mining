<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Equations based on cystatin C provide an alternative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared performance of the MDRD equation with a selection of cystatin C-based formulae for estimation of GFR in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Estimated GFR was calculated using the MDRD equation and the cystatin C formulae proposed by several investigator teams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isotopic GFR was measured using plasma clearance of (51)Cr-EDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 106 participants, of whom 83 (78%) were men with the following characteristics, mean (SD): age 61 (9) years, HbA(1c) 7.10 (1.27)%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> 89.0 (12.7) micromol/l, cystatin C 0.859 (0.234) mg/l and isotopic GFR 104.5 (20.1) ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MDRD estimated GFR was 77.4 (13.6) ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) (p &lt; 0.05 for difference from isotopic GFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cystatin C-based calculations of estimated GFR were: Perkins 124.5 (31.8), Rule 90.0 (30.0), Stevens (age) 96.0 (30.4) and Stevens (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) 85.6 (19.0) ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) (p &lt; 0.05 for difference with isotopic GFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For Arnal's, MacIsaac's and Tan's formulae cystatin-C estimated GFR were 101.7 (34.8), 102.1 (27.0) and 101.6 (27.8) ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), respectively (p = NS for difference with isotopic GFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cystatin C-based formulae were less biased and, with the exception of Perkins' formula, more accurate to within 10% of isotopic GFR than MDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Performance of cystatin C equations was superior to MDRD in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support further evaluation of cystatin C for estimation of GFR in persons at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
