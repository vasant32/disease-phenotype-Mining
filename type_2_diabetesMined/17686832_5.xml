<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a single-blind cross-over design, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 37 +/- 4 g/day of Salba or wheat bran for 12 weeks while maintaining their conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty well-controlled subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (11 men and 9 women, aged 64 +/- 8 years, BMI 28 +/- 4 kg/m2, and A1C 6.8 +/- 0.9%) completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was set in the outpatient clinic of the Risk Factor Modification Center, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control treatment, Salba <z:mp ids='MP_0006264'>reduced systolic blood pressure</z:mp> (SBP) by 6.3 +/- 4 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (mg/l) by 40 +/- 1.6% (P = 0.04), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vonWillebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) by 21 +/- 0.3% (P = 0.03), with significant decreases in A1C and fibrinogen in relation to the Salba baseline but not with the control treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in safety parameters including liver, kidney and hemostatic function, or body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both plasma ALA and eicosapentaenoic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> levels were increased twofold (P &lt; 0.05) while consuming Salba </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term supplementation with Salba attenuated a major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> (SBP) and emerging factors (hs-CRP and vWF) safely beyond conventional therapy, while maintaining good glycemic and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control in people with well-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
