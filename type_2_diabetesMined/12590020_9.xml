<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were collected during a continuing prospective study (1998-99) of a group of Taiwanese subjects at high-risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (5.6-7.0 mmol/l) and exhibited 2-h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations &lt;11.1 mmol/l from 1992-94 to 1995-96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 644 non-diabetic subjects at baseline, 79.8% (514/644) had at least one follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 107 new cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed by 1999 WHO criteria in 2918.7 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate was 3.67%/year (107/2918.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for other possible associative variables, including gender, age, BMI, waist circumference, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo>, Cox's hazard model showed that those individuals with isolated IFG (impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and those individuals with isolated IGT (2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> impairment) exhibited similar risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those individuals with isolated IFG and isolated IGT showed a comparable impairment of basal or hepatic insulin sensitivity, but those individuals with isolated IFG had a greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> by the HOMA method </plain></SENT>
