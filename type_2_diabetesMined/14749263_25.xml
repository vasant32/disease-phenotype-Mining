<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The APM1 gene is located on chromosome 3q27 and linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the adiponectin level in plasma is decreased in comparison to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify genetic defects of the APM1 gene that contribute to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we genotyped 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 106 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 325 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and 497 nondiabetic control subjects in Swedish Caucasians by using dynamic allele-specific hybridization (DASH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that SNPs -11426(A/G) and -11377(G/C) in the proximal promoter region had significant differences of allele frequencies between type 2 diabetic patients and nondiabetic control subjects (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNP-11426(A/G) was significantly associated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic patients (P = 0.02) and in IGT subjects (P = 0.04), while the patients carrying CC and CG genotypes for SNP-11377(G/C) had a higher BMI than the patients with the GG genotype (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis of 13 SNPs in the APM1 gene showed that estimates of haplotype frequencies in Swedish Caucasians are similar to those estimated in French Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant association of haplotypes with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT was detected in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study provides additional evidence that SNPs in the proximal promoter region of the APM1 gene contribute to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
