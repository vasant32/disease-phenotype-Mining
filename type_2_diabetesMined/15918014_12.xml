<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently cloned the genes encoding two adiponectin receptors (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine whether ADIPOR1 and/or ADIPOR2 play a major role in genetic susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By direct sequencing and a search of public databases, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2, and investigated whether these SNPs are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the chromosomal region of ADIPOR1 was almost completely preserved, whereas the LD in ADIPOR2 was less well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the SNPs in ADIPOR1 or ADIPOR2 were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in ADIPOR1 or ADIPOR2 haplotype frequencies were observed between type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Genetic variations in ADIPOR1 or ADIPOR2 are unlikely to lead to a common genetic predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
