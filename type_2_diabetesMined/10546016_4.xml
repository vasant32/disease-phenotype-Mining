<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mortality in diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of the pretreatment coronary status in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI, as well as the effect of mechanical revascularization using percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI (n = 54) were prospectively enrolled into a study of immediate coronary angiography to guide PTCA of the occluded <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hospital and long-term course were assessed and compared with an unselected control group of nondiabetic patients (n = 358) who were enrolled in the same study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiography showed that sites of occlusion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary flow were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivessel disease and shock were more common in type 2 diabetic versus nondiabetic patients: 69 vs. 51% and 21 vs. 10% (P &lt; 0.02), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct PTCA was successful in &gt; 90% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality after 30 days was 13% in type 2 diabetic patients versus 5% in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction before discharge was lower in diabetic patients (48 +/- 17 vs. 55 +/- 15%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality 1 year after discharge was 11 vs. 4% in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, but not for late, mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Direct PTCA is safe and effective in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality after 30 days in unselected diabetic patients is &lt; 15% with this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Advanced disease and shock contribute to an increased mortality in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI versus nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
