<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore whether this sex difference is related to female sex hormones, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from 2,164 (1,329 women and 835 men) first-degree relatives of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized based on a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sex and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) effects on the distribution of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance were assessed using multinomial logistic regression corrected for familial clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with men, women were more likely to have isolated IGT (relative risk 1.8 [95% CI 1.3-2.5]) and less likely to have isolated IFG (0.5 [0.3-0.7]) adjusted for ethnicity, age, waist, fasting insulin, and early insulin release (DeltaI(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To evaluate HRT effects, postmenopausal women using (n = 238) or not using (n = 378) HRT were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HRT users were more likely to have isolated IGT (2.2 [1.2-4.0]) after adjustment, but the prevalence of isolated IFG did not differ by HRT status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the influence of sex and HRT on the prevalence of isolated IFG and isolated IGT, we conclude that female sex hormones may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IFG and IGT </plain></SENT>
