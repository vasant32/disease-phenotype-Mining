<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively followed 3,708 Finnish patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 25-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical activity, smoking status, blood pressure, height, weight, and serum cholesterol level were determined at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate single and joint effects of physical activity and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> on the risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 18.7 years, 1,423 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded, 906 of which were due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate or high levels of physical activity were associated with decreased total and cardiovascular mortality, whereas higher levels of BMI and blood pressure and current smoking were associated with increased total and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005178'>High serum cholesterol levels</z:mp> also increased cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of physical activity was consistent in diabetic patients with any levels of BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A moderate or high level of physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of total and cardiovascular mortality among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The favorable association of physical activity with longevity was observed regardless of the levels of BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and smoking </plain></SENT>
