<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials provide information regarding the safety and efficacy of medications used to manage type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but do not elucidate drug effectiveness in a typical managed care environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize "real-world" drug utilization patterns from both a prescriber and a patient perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a large administrative pharmacy claims database, using data on continuously pharmacy benefit-eligible members prescribed oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 12-month persistence rate for the OHA cohort was low, ranging from 31% for alpha-glucosidase inhibitors to 60% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; compliance rates varied between 70 and 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first 12 months of therapy, 36% of the patients remaining on therapy at 12 months had one or more therapy modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of therapy changes increased with the length of patient follow-up, with more than half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients experiencing at least one therapy change over the duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings document the wide variation in utilization patterns associated with pharmacological management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that opportunity exists to optimize its pharmacological management </plain></SENT>
