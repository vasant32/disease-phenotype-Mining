<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a mean baseline of 7.5%, HbA(1c) changes from baseline were -0.67% at Week 52 in both groups, confirming non-inferiority </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> compared with glipizide provided similar HbA(1c)-lowering efficacy over 52 weeks in patients on ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
