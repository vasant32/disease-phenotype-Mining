<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi>-lowering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy reduces the proportional risk as effectively in older patients as in younger individuals; however, limited data are available for elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a post hoc analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> among 1,129 patients aged 65-75 years at randomization with 1,709 younger patients in the Collaborative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (CARDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CARDS was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 10 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> for primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients aged 40-75 years with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations &lt;/=4.14 mmol/l followed for a median of 3.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was time to first occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> events, coronary revascularizations, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment resulted in a 38% reduction in relative risk ([95% CI -58 to -8], P = 0.017) of first major cardiovascular events in older patients and a 37% reduction ([-57 to -7], P = 0.019) in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding absolute risk reductions were 3.9 and 2.7%, respectively (difference 1.2% [95% CI -2.8 to 5.3], P = 0.546); numbers needed to treat for 4 years to avoid one event were 21 and 33, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality was reduced nonsignificantly by 22% ([-49 to 18], P = 0.245) and 37% ([-64 to 9], P = 0.98), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall safety profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> was similar between age-groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Absolute and relative benefits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy in older patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are substantial, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients warrant treatment unless specifically contraindicated </plain></SENT>
