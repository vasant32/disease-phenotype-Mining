<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We produced a Japanese version of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Family Behavior Checklist (DFBC) and tested its reliability and validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study enrolled Japanese patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who were living with their families: 158 patients in the Insulin Group and 169 in the Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">Hypoglycemic Agents</z:chebi> Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The external validity of the DFBC was tested with questionnaires of self-managed dietary and exercise behaviors, the Appraisal of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Scale (ADS), and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The DFBC comprised two components: "Negative" and "Positive" feedbacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cronbach's alpha in the subcategories was ≥0.93, and the test-retest showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.89. "Positive" and "Negative" scores correlated with self-managed dietary and/or exercise behaviors, the ADS scores in the both Groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients having HbA1c levels of ≤6.8% there was a correlation between their "Positive" and "Negative" scores and the scores of their families in both Groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The DFBC showed evidence of validity and reliability and may be a useful tool for quick assessment of self-managed treatment behavior of Japanese Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and support received from their family </plain></SENT>
