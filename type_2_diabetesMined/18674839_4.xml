<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some cases, in Japanese, 1-h PG is elevated despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), but the factors responsible remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), isolated impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), and isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) were divided into subgroups at 1-h PG of 10.0mM, and the four indices of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three categories, the insulinogenic index in subjects with elevated 1-h PG was remarkably lower than in those without elevated 1-h PG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the insulinogenic index was the strongest factor in elevated 1-h PG according to the multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, one third of the NGT subjects enrolled in this study had elevated 1-h PG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These subjects showed significantly elevated area under the curve of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (G-AUC) compared to NGT subjects without 1-h PG elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, elevated 1-h PG in Japanese subjects indicates mildly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> due to decreased early-phase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
