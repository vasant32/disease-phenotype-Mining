<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Zinc transporter eight (SLC30A8) is a major target of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in human type 1A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is implicated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affecting aa(325) lies within the region of highest ZnT8 autoantibody (ZnT8A) binding, prompting an investigation of its relationship to type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: ZnT8A radioimmunoprecipitation assays were performed in 421 new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 1 diabetic Caucasians using COOH-terminal constructs incorporating the known human aa(325) variants (Trp, Arg, and Gln) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined by PCR-based SNP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS-Sera from 224 subjects (53%) were reactive to Arg(325) probes, from 185 (44%) to Trp(325)probes, and from 142 (34%) to Gln(325)probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty subjects reacted only with Arg(325) constructs, 31 with Trp(325) only, and 1 with Gln(325) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The restriction to either Arg(325) or Trp(325) corresponded with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the respective C- or T-alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strong gene dosage effect was also evident because both<z:chebi fb="17" ids="29952"> Arg-</z:chebi> and Trp-restricted ZnT8As were less prevalent in heterozygous than homozygous individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SLC30A8 SNP allele frequency (75% C and 25% T) varied little with age of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or the presence of other autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The finding that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> can be defined by a single polymorphic residue has not previously been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It argues against ZnT8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> arising from molecular mimicry and suggests a mechanistic link between the two major forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has implications for antigen-based therapeutic interventions because the response to ZnT8 administration could be protective or immunogenic depending on an individual's genotype </plain></SENT>
