<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Considerable evidence implicates impaired nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) generation in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a pilot study to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6061">isosorbide dinitrate</z:chebi> (ISDN), a NO donor with local vasodilating properties, in spray form in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and two-period cross-over design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 2-week run-in period, 22 diabetic patients (13 men, 20 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age [mean +/- SE] 63.7 +/- 1.8 years, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 9.1 +/- 1.5 years, duration of painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> 2.6 +/- 0.4 years) were randomized to receive ISDN or placebo sprays for 4 weeks, exchanging their treatment for a further 4 weeks after a 2-week wash-out period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients administered the spray to both feet before bedtime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biweekly pain and other sensory symptoms were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and the Lickert scale, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ISDN spray reduced overall neuropathic pain (P = 0.02) and burning sensation (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No treatment difference was observed with other sensory modalities (hot/cold sensation, tingling, numbness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100963'>hyperesthesia</z:hpo>, and jabbing-like sensation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At study completion, 11 patients (50%) reported benefit and wished to continue using the ISDN spray, 4 (18%) preferred the placebo spray, and the remaining 7 (32%) were undecided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ISDN spray offers an alternative and effective pharmacological option in relieving overall pain and burning sensation in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751074" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">painful diabetic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The potential of ISDN spray in alleviating other specific sensory symptoms associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> merits further study </plain></SENT>
