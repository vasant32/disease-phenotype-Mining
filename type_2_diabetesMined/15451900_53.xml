<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Glycemic control using inhaled, dry-powder insulin plus a single injection of long-acting insulin was compared with a conventional regimen in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which was previously managed with at least two daily insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to 6 months' treatment with either premeal inhaled insulin plus a bedtime dose of Ultralente (n = 149) or at least two daily injections of subcutaneous insulin (mixed regular/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin; n = 150) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was the change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c decreased similarly in the inhaled (-0.7%) and subcutaneous (-0.6%) insulin groups (adjusted treatment group difference: -0.07%, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA1c &lt; 7.0% was achieved in more patients receiving inhaled (46.9%) than subcutaneous (31.7%) insulin (odds ratio 2.27, 95% CI 1.24-4.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (events per subject-month) was slightly lower in the inhaled (1.4 events) than in the subcutaneous (1.6 events) insulin group (risk ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97), with no difference in severe events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other adverse events, with the exception of increased cough in the inhaled insulin group, were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference in pulmonary function testing was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are underway to assess tolerability in the longer term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin antibody binding increased more in the inhaled insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction was greater in the inhaled insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled insulin appears to be effective, well tolerated, and well accepted in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and provides glycemic control comparable to a conventional subcutaneous regimen </plain></SENT>
