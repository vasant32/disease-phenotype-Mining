<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hyperglycaemic state is often accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, low-grade systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> which collectively result in a high risk of micro- and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents do not sufficiently address fore-mentioned macrovascular-risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, new therapeutic agents were introduced, based on the incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1), that is, the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (GLP-1RA) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beside its effect on pancreatic insulin secretion, GLP-1 exerts several extra-pancreatic effects such as slowing down gastric emptying, promoting satiety and reducing food intake and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, GLP-1 and GLP-1RA were shown to improve cardiovascular-risk profiles, by reducing body fat content, blood pressure, circulating <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and inflammatory markers in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the presently known evidence with regard to extra-pancreatic effects of the incretin-based agents, focusing on the actions that improve the cardiovascular-risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We present available data from clinical trials of at least 24â€‰week duration, but also findings from small-sized clinical 'proof of principle' studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that GLP-1 RA and to a lesser extent DPP-4 inhibitors are promising agents with regard to their effects on body weight, blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, which collectively ameliorate the cardiovascular-risk profile and as such may have added value in the treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, large-sized long-term outcome studies are warranted to show the true added value of these agents in the treatment of patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
