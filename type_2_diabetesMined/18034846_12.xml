<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were transferred to insulin detemir, while the OAD regimen and number of injections remained the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of serious adverse drug reactions, including major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, within-patient fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability and body weight change were measured at 14 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycaemic control improved in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (HbA(1c) = -0.2%, p &lt; 0.05; fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> -1.0 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.0001) and glargine (HbA(1c) = -0.6%, p &lt; 0.0001; fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> -1.4 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.0001) groups, including a reduction in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability (p &lt; 0.01 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of total and nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reduced in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and glargine groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was low and did not change significantly during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight was significantly reduced in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (-0.7 kg, p &lt; 0.01) and glargine (-0.5 kg, p &lt; 0.05) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, transferring from other basal insulins to insulin detemir in combination with OADs was associated with improvements in glycaemic control, which were accompanied by a reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and a reduction in body weight </plain></SENT>
