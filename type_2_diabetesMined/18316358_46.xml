<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A genome-wide association study conducted by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium recently associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FTO (fatso/fat mass and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> associated) gene with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These associations were shown to be mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other research groups found similar results in Europeans and Hispanics but not African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which FTO influences <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the role of two FTO SNPs (rs17817449 and rs1421085) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, insulin sensitivity, and body weight regulation, including energy intake and expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 908 individuals from the Quebec City metropolitan area that participated in the Quebec Family Study, a long-term study of extensively phenotyped individuals designed to investigate factors involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found significant associations for both SNPs with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, rs17817449 was associated with BMI (P = 0.0014), weight (P = 0.0059), and waist circumference (P = 0.0021) under an additive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, this FTO SNP influenced fasting insulin (P = 0.011), homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P = 0.038), and an insulin sensitivity index derived from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (P = 0.0091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associations were also found with resting metabolic rate (RMR) (P = 0.042) and plasma leptin levels (P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for BMI abolished the associations with insulin sensitivity, RMR, and plasma leptin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that genetic variation at the FTO locus contributes to the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and increased plasma leptin levels </plain></SENT>
